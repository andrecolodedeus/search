<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Tradition and Living Magisterium</h1>  

<p>The word <em>tradition</em> (Greek <em>paradosis</em>) in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sense, which is the only one in which it is used here, refers sometimes to the thing (doctrine, account, or custom) transmitted from one generation to another; sometimes to the organ or mode of the transmission (<em>kerigma ekklisiastikon, predicatio ecclesiastica</em>).

<p>In the first sense it is an old tradition that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was born on 25 December, in the second sense tradition relates that on the road to Calvary a <a href="../cathen/15362a.htm">pious woman</a> wiped the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> language, which in many circumstances has become current, there is still greater precision and this in countless directions. At first there was question only of traditions claiming a Divine origin, but subsequently there arose questions of oral as distinct from written tradition, in the sense that a given <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or institution is not directly dependent on <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> as its source but only on the oral teaching of Christ or the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Finally with regard to the organ of tradition it must be an official organ, a <em>magisterium</em>, or teaching authority.

<p>Now in this respect there are several points of controversy between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and every body of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Is all <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> consigned to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>? or can it, must it, be admitted that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to be transmitted to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that the Apostles received either from the very lips of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> or from inspiration or Revelation, Divine instructions which they transmitted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and which were not committed to the inspired writings? Must it be admitted that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as the official and authentic organ to transmit and explain in virtue of Divine authority the Revelation made to men? The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> principle is: The Bible and nothing but the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>; the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, according to them, is the sole <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> source; there are no <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> save the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>; according to them the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is the sole <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>: by it and by it alone should all dogmatic questions be solved; it is the only binding authority. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, on the other hand, hold that there may be, that there is in fact, and that there must of necessity be certain <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> apart from those contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>; they hold furthermore that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has established in fact, and that to adapt the means to the end He should have established, a living organ as much to transmit Scripture and written Revelation as to place <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> within reach of everyone always and everywhere. Such are in this respect the two main points of controversy between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and so-called <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (as distinguished from liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who admit neither <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> Revelation nor the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>). The other differences are connected with these or follow from them, as also the differences between different <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>--according as they are more or less faithful to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> principle, they recede from or approach the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position.

<p>Between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of the East there are not the same fundamental differences, since both sides admit the Divine institution and Divine authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the more or less living and explicit sense of its <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> and indefectibility and its other teaching prerogatives, but there are contentions concerning the bearers of the authority, the organic unity of the teaching body, the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a>, and the existence and nature of dogmatic development in the transmission of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of tradition does not consist altogether in controversy and discussions with adversaries. Many questions arise in this respect for every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who wishes to give an exact account of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and the principles he professes: What is the precise relation between oral tradition and the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and that between the living magisterium and the inspired Scriptures? May new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> enter the current of tradition, and what is the part of the magisterium with regard to revelations which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may yet make? How is this official magisterium organized, and how is it to recognize a Divine tradition or <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? What is its proper r&ocirc;le with regard to tradition? Where and how are <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> preserved and transmitted? What befalls the deposit of tradition in its transmission through the ages? These and similar questions are treated elsewhere in the CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA, but here we must separate and group all that has reference to tradition and to the living magisterium inasmuch as it is the organ of preservation and transmission of traditional and <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>The following are the points to be treated:

<blockquote><p>I. The existence of Divine traditions not contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, and the Divine institution of the living magisterium to defend and transmit <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the prerogative of this magisterium; <br>II. The relation of Scripture to the living magisterium, and of the living magisterium to Scripture; <br>III. The proper mode of existence of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the way to recognize this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; <br>IV. The organization and exercise of the living magisterium; its precise r&ocirc;le in the defence and transmission of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; its limits, and modes of action; <br>V. The identity of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the varieties of formulas, systematization, and dogmatic development; the identity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and through the variations of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.</p></blockquote>



<p>A full treatment of these questions would require a lengthy development; here only a brief outline can be given, the reader being referred to special works for a fuller explanation.
<h2 id="section1">Divine traditions not contained in Holy Scripture; institution of the living magisterium; its prerogatives</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> attacks on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were at first directed only against <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> details, but the very authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was involved in the dispute, and this soon became evident to both sides. However the controversy continued for many years to turn on particular points of traditional teaching rather than on the teaching authority and the chief weapons were Biblical texts. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, even while implying in its decisions and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> the authority of the living magisterium (which the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> themselves dared not explicitly deny), while appealing to ecclesiastical tradition and the sense of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> either for the determination of the canon or for the interpretation of some passages of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, even while making a rule of interpretation in Biblical matters, did not pronounce explicitly concerning the teaching authority, contenting itself with saying that <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is found in the sacred books and in the unwritten traditions coming from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the Apostles; these were the sources from which it would draw. The Council, as is evident, held that there are Divine traditions not contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, revelations made to the Apostles either orally by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> or by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and transmitted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> is therefore not the only <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> source of the Revelation made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Side by side with Scripture there is tradition, side by side with the written revelation there is the oral revelation. This granted, it is impossible to be satisfied with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> alone for the solution of all dogmatic questions. Such was the first field of controversy between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. The designation of unwritten Divine traditions was not always given all the clearness desirable especially in early times; however <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialists soon <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> that to be <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and consistent they must admit unwritten traditions as revealed. Otherwise by what right did they rest on Sunday and not on Saturday? How could they regard infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as valid, or <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by infusion? How could they permit the taking of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had commanded that we swear not at all? The <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a> were more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> in refusing all <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> in re-baptizing adults, the <a href="../cathen/13287a.htm">Sabbatarians</a> in resting on Saturday. But none were so consistent as not to be open to criticism on some point. Where is it indicated in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is the sole source of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Going further, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialists showed their opponents that of this very Bible, to which alone they wished to refer, they could not have the authentic canon nor even a sufficient guarantee without an authority other than that of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> parried the blow by having recourse to a certain taste to which the Divine word would manifest itself as such in the same way that honey is recognized by the palate. And this in fact was the only loophole, for <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> recognized that no human authority was acceptable in this matter. But this was a very subjective criterion and one calling for caution. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> dared not adhere to it. They came eventually, after rejecting the Divine tradition received from the Apostles by the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> Church, to rest their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> only as a human authority, which moreover was especially insufficient under the circumstances, since it opened up all manner of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> and prepared the way for Biblical <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>. There is not, in fact, any sufficient guarantee for the canon of the Scriptures, for the total inspiration or inerrancy of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, save in a Divine testimony which, not being contained in the Holy Books with sufficient clearness and amplitude, nor being sufficiently recognizable to the scrutiny of a scholar who is only a scholar, does not reach us with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> warrant it would bear if brought by a Divinely assisted authority, as is, according to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the authority of the living magisterium of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such is the way in which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> demonstrate to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> that there should be and that there are in fact Divine traditions not contained in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>.

<p>In a similar way they show that they cannot dispense with a teaching authority, a Divinely authorized living magistracy for the solution of controversies arising among themselves and of which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> itself was often the occasion. Indeed experience <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that each man found in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> his own <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, as was said by one of the earliest reforming sectarians: "Hic liber est in quo quaerit sua dogmata quisque, invenit et pariter dogmata quisque sua." One man found the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, another a purely symbolic presence, another some sort of efficacious presence. The exercise of free inquiry with regard to Biblical texts led to endless disputes, to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, and eventually to the denial of all <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. These disputes, <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, and denial could not be according to the Divine intention. Hence the necessity of a competent authority to solve controversies and interpret the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. To say that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was perfectly clear and sufficient to all was obviously a retort born of desperation, a defiance of experience and common sense. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> refuted it without difficulty, and their position was amply justified when the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> began compromising themselves with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, rejecting the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> magisterium only to fall under that of princes.

<p>Moreover it was enough to look at the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, to read it without prejudice to see that the economy of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> preaching was above all one of oral teaching. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> preached, He did not write. In His preaching He appealed to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, but He was not satisfied with the mere reading of it, He explained and interpreted it, He made use of it in His teaching, but He did not substitute it for His teaching. There is the example of the mysterious traveller who explained to the disciples of <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a> what had reference to Him in the Scriptures to convince them that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had to suffer and thus enter into His glory. And as He preached Himself so He sent His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to preach; He did not commission them to write but to teach, and it was by oral teaching and preaching that they instructed the nations and brought them to the Faith. If some of them wrote and did so under <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a> it is manifest that this was as it were incidentally. They did not write for the sake of writing, but to supplement their oral teaching when they could not go themselves to recall or explain it, to solve practical questions, etc. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who of all the Apostles wrote the most, did not dream of writing everything nor of replacing his oral teaching by his writings. Finally, the same texts which show us Christ instituting His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Apostles founding Churches and spreading <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> throughout the world show us at the same time the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> instituted as a teaching authority; the Apostles claimed for themselves this authority, sending others as they had been sent by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and as Christ had been sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, always with power to teach and to impose <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as well as to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Whoever believed them would be saved; whoever refused to believe them would be condemned. It is the living Church and not Scripture that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> indicates as the pillar and the unshakable ground of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And the inference of texts and facts is only what is exacted by the nature of things. A book although Divine and inspired is not intended to support itself. If it is obscure (and what unprejudiced <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> will deny that there are obscurities in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>?) it must be interpreted. And even if it is clear it does not carry with it the guarantee of its Divinity, its authenticity, or its value. Someone must bring it within reach and no matter what be done the believer cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> nor find in it the object of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> until he has previously made an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the intermediary authorities between the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his reading. Now, authority for authority, is it not better to have recourse to that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> than to that of the first comer? Liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, such as M. Auguste Sabatier, have been the first to recognize that, if there must be a religion of authority, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system with the splendid organization of its living magisterium is far superior to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> system, which rests everything on the authority of a book.

<p>The prerogatives of this teaching authority are made sufficiently clear by the texts and they are to a certain extent implied in the very institution. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> Epistle to Timothy, is the pillar and ground of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; the Apostles and consequently their successors have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to impose their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; whosoever refuses to believe them shall be condemned, whosoever rejects anything is shipwrecked in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. This authority is therefore <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> is guaranteed implicitly but directly by the promise of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>: "Behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world." Briefly the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> continues Christ in its mission to teach as in its mission to sanctify; its power is the same as that which He received from His Father and, as He came full of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> no less than of grace, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is likewise an institution of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as it is an institution of grace. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was intended to be spread throughout the world despite so many obstacles of every kind, and the accomplishment of the task required <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. So did Christ give to his Apostles the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous power</a> which guaranteed their teaching. As He Himself confirmed His words by His works He wished that they also should present with their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> unexceptionable motives for credibility. Their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were the Divine seals of their mission and their Apostolate. The Divine seal has always been stamped on the teaching authority. It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that every missionary should work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself is an ever-living <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, bearing always on her brow the unexceptionable witness that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with her.
<h2 id="section2">The relation of Scripture to the living magisterium, and of the living magisterium to Scripture</h2>

<p>This relation is the same as that between the Gospel and the Apostolic preaching. Christ made use of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, He appealed to it as to an irrefragable authority, He explained and interpreted it and furnished the key to it, with it he shed light on His own <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and mission. The Apostles did in like manner when they spoke to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Both sides had access to the Scriptures in a text admitted by all, both recognized in them a Divine authority, as in the very word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This was also the way of the faithful in their studies and discussions; but with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and unbelievers it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to begin with presenting the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and guaranteeing its authority &#151; the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> concerning the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> had to be explained to the faithful themselves, and the guarantee of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> demonstrated. The Bible had been committed to the care of the living magisterium. It was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> part to guard the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, to present it to the faithful in authorized editions or accurate translations, it was for her to make known the nature and value of the Divine Book by declaring what she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> regarding its inspiration and inerrancy, it was for her to supply the key by explaining why and how it had been inspired, how it contained Revelation, how the proper object of that Revelation was not purely human instruction but a religious and moral <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with a view to our <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> destiny and the means to attain it, how, the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> being a preparation and annunciation of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> and the new <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, there might be found beneath the husk of the letter typical meanings, figures, and prophecies. It was for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in consequence to determine the authentic canon, to specify the special rules and conditions for interpretation, to pronounce in case of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the exact sense of a given book or text, and even when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to safeguard the historical, prophetical, or apologetic value of a given text or passage, to pronounce in certain questions of authenticity, <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, or translation, either to reject an opinion compromising the authority of the book or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> of its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or to maintain a given body of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in a given text. It was above all for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to circulate the Divine Book by minting its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, adapting and explaining it, by offering it and drawing from it nourishment wherewith to nourish <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, briefly by supplementing the book, making use of it, and assisting others to make use of it. This is the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of Scripture to the living magisterium.

<p>On the other hand the living magisterium owes much to Scripture. There it finds the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, new-blown so to speak, as it was expressed under Divine agency by the inspired author; while oral tradition, although faithfully transmitting <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with the Divine assistance, nevertheless transmits it only in human formulas. Scripture gives us beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to a certain extent a human expression of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which it presents, since this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is developed in and by a human brain acting in a human manner, but also to a certain extent Divine, since this human development takes place wholly under the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So also with due proportion it may be said of the inspired word what Christ said of His: It is spirit and life. In a sense differing from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> sense which sometimes goes so far as to deify the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, but, in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense, we admit that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaks to us in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> more directly than in oral teaching. The latter, moreover, ever faithful to the recommendations which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> made to his disciple Timothy, does not fail to have recourse to Biblical sources for its instruction and to draw thence the heavenly <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, to take thence with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> a sure, ever-young, and ever-living expression of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, one more adequate than any other despite the inevitable inadaptability of human formulas to divine realities In the hands of masters Scripture may become a sharp defensive and offensive weapon against <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. When a controversy arises recourse is had first to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Frequently when decisive texts are found masters wield them skilfully and in such a way as to demonstrate their irresistible force. If none are found of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> clearness the assistance of Scripture is not thereby abandoned. Guided by the clear sense of the living and luminous <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which it bears within itself, by its likeness to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> defended at need against <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by the Divine assistance, the living magisterium strives, explains, argues, and occasionally subtilizes in order to bring forward texts which, if they lack an independent and absolute value, have an <em>ad hominem</em> force, or value, through the authority of the authentic interpreter, whose very thought, if it is not, or is not clearly, in Scripture, nevertheless stands forth with a distinctness or new clearness in this manipulation of Scripture, by this contact with it.

<p>Manifestly there is no question here of a meaning which is not in Scripture and which the magisterium reads into it by imposing it as the Biblical meaning. This individual writers may do and have sometimes done, for they are not <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> as <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but not the authentic magisterium. There is question only of the advantage which the living magisterium draws from Scripture whether to attain a clearer consciousness of its own thought, to formulate it in hieratic terms, or to triumphantly reject an opinion favourable to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. As regards Biblical interpretation properly so called the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in the sense that, whether by authentic decision of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or council, or by its current teaching that a given passage of Scripture has a certain meaning, this meaning must be regarded as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the passage in question. It claims this power of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> interpretation only in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, that is where religious or moral <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is in danger, directly, if the text or passage belongs to the moral and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order; indirectly, if in assigning a meaning to a text or book the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, its moral value, or the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of its inspiration or inerrancy is imperilled. Without going further into the manifold services which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> renders to the living magisterium mention must nevertheless be made as particularly important of its services in the apologetic order. In fact Scripture by its historic value, which is indisputable and undisputed on many points, furnishes the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> with irrefragable arguments in support of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> religion. It contains for example <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> whose reality is impressed on the historian with the same <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> as the most acknowledged facts. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perhaps more strikingly so of the argument from the prophecies, for the Scriptures, the Old as well as the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, contain manifest prophecies, the fulfilment of which we behold either in Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> or in the later development of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>.

<p>In view of all this it will be readily understood that since the time of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has urgently recommended to her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, that she has watched with a  jealous authority over its integral transmission, its exact translation, and its faithful interpretation If occasionally she has seemed to restrict its use or its diffusion this too was through an easily comprehensible <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and a particular esteem for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, that the sacred Book might not like a profane book be made a ground for curiosity, endless discussions, and abuses of every kind. In short, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at last proves to be the best safeguard for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> against the excesses of an unbridled reason, so by the very avowal of sincere <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> does she show herself at the present day the best defender of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> against an unrestrained Biblicism or an unchecked criticism.
<h2 id="section3">The proper mode of existence of revealed truth in the mind of the Church and the way to recognize this truth</h2>

<p>There is a formula current in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> (and the formula is borrowed from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> himself) that traditional <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was confided to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a deposit which it would guard and faithfully transmit as it had received it without adding to it or taking anything away. This formula expresses very well one of the aspects of tradition and one of the principal r&ocirc;les of the living magisterium. But this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a deposit should not make us lose sight of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> manner in which traditional <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> lives and is transmitted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This deposit in fact is not an inanimate thing passed from hand to hand; it is not, properly speaking, an assemblage of doctrines and institutions consigned to books or other monuments. Books and monuments of every kind are a means, an organ of transmission, they are not, properly speaking, the tradition itself. To better understand the latter it must be represented as a current of life and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> coming from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through Christ and through the Apostles to the last of the faithful who repeats his creed and learns his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. This conception of tradition is not always clear to all at the first glance. It must be reached, however, if we wish to form a clear and exact <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. We can endeavour to explain it to ourselves in the following manner: We are all conscious of an assemblage of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> or opinions living in our mind and forming part of the very life of our mind, sometimes they find their clear expression, again we find ourselves without the exact formula wherewith to express them to ourselves or to others an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is in search as it were of its expression, sometimes it even acts in us and leads us to actions without our having as yet the reflective consciousness of it. Something similar may be said of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> or opinions which live, as it were, and stir the social sentiment of a people, a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, or any other well-characterized group to form what is called the spirit of the day, the spirit of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, or the spirit of a people.

<p>This common sentiment is in a sense nothing else than the sum of individual sentiments, and yet we feel clearly that it is quite another thing than the individual taken individually. It is a fact of experience that there is a common sentiment, as if there were such a thing as a common spirit, and as if this common spirit were the abode of certain <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and opinions which are doubtless the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and opinions of each man, but which take on a peculiar aspect in each man inasmuch as they are the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and opinions of all. The existence of tradition in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be regarded as living in the spirit and the heart, thence translating itself into acts, and expressing itself in words or writings; but here we must not have in mind individual sentiment, but the common sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the sense or sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, that is, of all who live by its life and are in communion of thought among themselves and with her. The living <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of all, it is the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, not merely inasmuch as they are <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but inasmuch as they form part of the same social body. This sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is peculiar in this, that it is itself under the influence of grace. Hence it follows that it is not subject, like that of other human groups to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and thoughtless or culpable tendencies. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> always living in His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> upholds the sense of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ever living therein.

<p>Documents of all kinds (writings, monuments, etc.) are in the hands of masters, as of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, a means of finding or recognizing the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> confided to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the direction of her <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. There is between written documents and the living magisterium of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a relation similar, proportionately speaking, to that already outlined between Scripture and the living magisterium. In them is found the traditional thought expressed according to varieties of environments and circumstances, no longer in an inspired language, as is the case with Scripture, but in a purely human language, consequently subject to the imperfections and shortcomings of human thought. Nevertheless the more the documents are the exact expression of the living thought of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the more they thereby possess the value and authority which belong to that thought because they are so much the better expression of tradition. Often formulas of the past have themselves entered the traditional current and become the official formulas of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence it will be understood that the living magisterium searches in the past, now for authorities in favour of its present thought in order to defend it against attacks or dangers of mutilation, now for light to walk the right road without straying. The thought of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is essentially a traditional thought and the living magisterium by taking cognizance of ancient formulas of this thought thereby recruits its strength and prepares to give to immutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> a new expression which shall be in harmony with the circumstances of the day and within reach of contemporary <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. Revealed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has sometimes found definitive formulas from the earliest times; then the living magisterium has only had to preserve and explain them and put them in circulation. Sometimes attempts have been made to express this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, without success. It even happens that, in attempting to express <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the terms of some philosophy or to fuse it with some current of human thought, it has been distorted so as to be scarcely recognizable, so closely mingled with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that it becomes difficult to separate them. When the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> studies the ancient monuments of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> she casts over the past the reflection of her living and present thought and by some sympathy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of today with that of yesterday she succeeds in recognizing through the obscurities and inaccuracies of ancient formulas the portions of traditional <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, even when they are mixed with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is also (as regards religious and moral doctrines) the best interpreter of truly traditional documents; she recognizes as by <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> what belongs to the current of her living thought and distinguishes it from the foreign elements which may have become mixed with it in the course of centuries.

<p>The living magisterium, therefore, makes extensive use of documents of the past, but it does so while judging and interpreting, gladly finding in them its present thought, but likewise, when needful, distinguishing its present thought from what is traditional only in appearance. It is <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> always living in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or, if it is preferred, the present thought of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in continuity with her traditional thought, which is for it the final criterion, according to which the living magisterium adopts as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or rejects as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> the often obscure and confused formulas which occur in the monuments of the past. Thus are explained both her respect for the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and her supreme independence towards those writings--she judges them more than she is judged by them. Harnack has said that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is accustomed to conceal her evolution and to efface as well as she can the differences between her present and her former thought by condemning as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the most faithful witnesses of what was formerly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Not understanding what tradition is, the ever-living thought of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he believes that she <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> her past when she merely distinguished between what was traditional <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the past and what was only human alloy mixed with that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the personal opinion of an author substituting itself for the general thought of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community. With regard to official documents, the expression of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> magisterium of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> embodied in the decision of councils, or the solemn judgments of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> never gainsays what she has once decided. She is then linked with her past because in this past her entire self is concerned and not any fallible organ of her thought. Hence she still finds her <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> in these venerable monuments; the formulas may have grown old, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which they express is always her present thought.
<h2 id="section4">The organization and exercise of the living magisterium; its precise r&ocirc;le in the defence and transmission of revealed truth--its limits and modes of action</h2>

<p>Closer study of the living magisterium will enable us to better understand the splendid organism created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and gradually developed that it might preserve, transmit, and bring within the reach of all <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, ever the same, but adapted to every variety of time, circumstances, and environment. Properly speaking, this magisterium is a teaching authority; it not only presents the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but it has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to impose it, since its power is the very power given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This authority is called the teaching Church. The teaching Church is essentially composed of the episcopal body, which continues here below the work and mission of the Apostolic College. It was indeed in the form of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> or social body that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> grouped His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and it is likewise as a social body that the episcopate exercises its mission to teach. <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Doctrinal infallibility</a> has been guaranteed to the episcopal body and to the head of that body as it was guaranteed to the Apostles, with this difference, however, between the Apostles and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that each Apostle was personally <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> (in virtue of his extraordinary mission as founder and the plenitude of the Holy Ghost received on Pentecost by the Twelve and later communicated to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> as to the Twelve), whereas only the body of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> and each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not so, save in proportion as he teaches in communion and concert with the entire episcopal body.

<p>At the head of this episcopal body is the supreme authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a> in his primacy as he is his successor in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. As supreme authority in the teaching body, which is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, he himself is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>. The episcopal body is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> also, but only in union with its head, from whom moreover it may not separate, since to do so would be to separate from the foundation on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is built. The authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may be exercised without the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and this even in <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> decisions which both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and faithful are bound to receive with the same submission. The authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may be exercised in two ways; now each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> teaches the flock confided to him, again the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assemble in council to draw up together and pass <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> or disciplinary decrees. When all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world (this totality is to be understood as morally speaking; it suffices for the whole Church to be represented) are thus assembled in council the council is called oecumenical. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decrees of an oecumenical council, once they are approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, are <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> as are the ex cathedra definitions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. Although the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, taken individually, are not <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> their teaching participates in the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> according as they teach in concert and in union with the episcopal body, that is according as they express not their personal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, but the very thought of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Beside the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> are the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, many of which are especially concerned with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> questions. Some of them, such as the Congregation of the Index, are not so concerned save from a disciplinary standpoint, by prohibiting the reading of certain books, regarded as dangerous to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, if not by the very <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which they contain, at least by their way of expressing it or by their unreasonableness. Other congregations, that of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, for example, have a more directly <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority. This authority is never <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>; it is nevertheless binding and exacts a religious submission, interior as well as exterior. Nevertheless this interior submission does not necessarily bear on the absolute <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerned in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, it may only bear on the safety or danger of a certain teaching or opinion, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> itself usually having in view only the moral qualification of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. To assist them in their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> task the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have all those who teach by their authority or under their surveillance; <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>, professors in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> establishments, in a word, all who teach or explain <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>.

<p>Theological teaching in all its forms (in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, etc.) gives valuable assistance as a whole to the teaching authority and to all who teach under that authority. In the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> the masters themselves have acquired the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which usually assists them to discern <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or falsehood in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> matters, they have drawn thence what they themselves are to provide. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> as such do not form a part of the teaching Church, but as professional expounders of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they study it scientifically, they collect and systematize it, they illumine it with all the lights of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, history, etc. They are, as it were, the natural consultors of the teaching authority, to furnish it with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> information and data; they thereby prepare and sometimes in an even more direct manner by their reports, their written consultations, their projects or <em>schemata</em>, and their preparatory redactions the official documents which the teaching authority completely develops and publishes authoritatively. On the other hand, their scientific works are useful for the instruction of those who should spread and popularize the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, put it in circulation, and adapt it to all by speech or writings of every kind. It is evident what marvellous unity is attained on this point alone in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teaching and how the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, descended from above, distributed through a thousand different channels, finally comes pure and undefiled to the most lowly and the most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.

<p>This multifarious work, of scientific exposition as well as of popularization and propaganda, is likewise assisted by the countless written forms of religious teaching, among which catechisms have a special character of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> security, approved as they are by the teaching authority and claiming only to set forth with clearness and precision the teaching common in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus the child who learns his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> may, provided he is informed of it, take cognizance that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> presented to him is not the personal opinion of the volunteer catechist or of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who communicates it to him. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> is the same in all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, apart from a few differences of detail which have no bearing on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> all the catechisms of a country are alike; the differences between those of one country and another are scarcely perceptible. It is truly the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and transmitted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which thus reaches even little children by the voice of the catechist, or the savage by that of the missionary. This diffusion of the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> throughout the world and this unity of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among the most diverse peoples is a marvel which by itself forces the recognition that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. St. Iren&aelig;us in his time was in admiration of it and he expressed his admiration in language of such brilliancy and poetry as is seldom to be met with in the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. The outer and visible cause of its diffusion and unity is the splendid organization of the living magisterium. This magisterium was not instituted to receive new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, but to guard, transmit, propagate, and preserve <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from every admixture of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to cause it to prevail. Moreover the magisterium should not be considered as external to the community of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Those who teach cannot and should not teach save what they have learned themselves, those who have the office of teachers have been chosen from among the faithful and they first of all are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to believe what they propose to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of others. Moreover they usually propose to the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the faithful only the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of which the latter have already made more or less explicit profession. Sometimes it is even by sounding as it were the common sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, still more by scrutinizing the monuments of the past, that masters and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> discover that such and such a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, perhaps in dispute, belongs nevertheless to the traditional deposit. More than one among the faithful may be unconscious of personal <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in it, but if he is in union of thought with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he believes implicitly that which perhaps he declines to recognize explicitly as an object of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It was thus with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception before it was inserted in the explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Hence there is between the teaching Church and the faithful an intimate union of thought and heart. The teaching authority loses nothing of its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; these are limited only from above by the very conditions of the command which they have received. But the exercise of this authority is by so much more certain and easy as the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, generally, so to speak, confirm by their adhesion the decisions of this authority: a <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">dogmatic definition</a> scarcely does more than sanction the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> already existing in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community. The better to understand, adapt, and preserve <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> against attacks or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> the masters in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> naturally appeal to all the resources offered by human <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Among these <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> philosophy, history, languages, philology in all its forms necessarily have an important place in the arsenal of the teaching magisterium. With regard to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> systematization in particular, philosophy necessarily intervenes to assist <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> better to comprehend <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the better to synthesize traditional data, and the better to explain the dogmatic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a fruitful alliance was formed between <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. It may happen that philosophy and the other human <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are at variance with <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The conflict is never insoluble, for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> can never be opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, nor the human <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. But the fact remains that scientific hypothesis, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> which seeks itself, and philosophy which develops itself sometimes seem in opposition to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In this case the teaching Church has the right, in order to preserve traditional <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to condemn the assertions, opinions, and hypotheses which, although not direct denials, nevertheless endanger it or rather expose some <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to the loss of it. Authority has need to be prudent in these condemnations and it is well known that the cases are very rare when it may be asserted with any appearance of justification that it has not been sufficiently so, but its right to interfere is indisputable for anyone who admits the Divine institution of the magisterium.

<p>There are then between purely profane facts and opinions and <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> mixed facts and opinions which by their nature belong to the human order, but which are in intimate contact and close connexion with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. These facts are called <a href="../cathen/05092a.htm">dogmatic facts</a> and these opinions <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions. In very virtue of its mission the teaching authority has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over these facts and opinions; it is even a positive <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if not a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05092a.htm">dogmatic facts</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions may also like dogmatic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> themselves be the object of an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> decision. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is no less <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in maintaining that the five famous propositions are in <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> than in condemning these propositions as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. A distinction must be made between dogmatic traditions or <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> traditions, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> customs, and the accounts of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> manifestations or revelations which circulate in the world of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> intervenes in order to pronounce in these matters it is never to canonize them, if we may so speak, nor to give them an authority of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; in such cases it claims only to preserve them against temerarious attacks, to pronounce that they contain nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and to recognize in them a human value sufficient for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to nourish itself therewith freely and without danger.
<h2 id="section5">The identity of revealed truth in the varieties of formulas, systematization, and dogmatic development, the identity of faith in the Church and through the variations of theology</h2>

<p>The saying of Sully Prud'homme is well known, "How is it that this which is so complicated (the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa"</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>) has proceeded from what was so simple (the Gospel)?" In fact when we read a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatise or the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and anti-Modernist <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> imposed by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> they seem at first glance very different from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> or the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>. On closer study we become aware that the differences are not irreconcilable; despite appearances the "Summa" and the anti-Modernist <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> are naturally linked with the Scripture and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. To grasp thoroughly the identity of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> such as was believed in the early centuries with the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> which we now profess, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to study thoroughly the process of dogmatic expression in the complete history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. It is sufficient here to indicate its general outlines and characteristics. That which was shown in Scripture or the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Evangelic Revelation</a> as a living reality (the Divine Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>) has been formulated in abstract terms (one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, two natures) or in concrete formulas (my Father and I are one); men passed constantly from the implicit seen or received to the explicit reasoned and reflected upon; they analyzed the complex data, compared the separate elements, built up a system of the scattered <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>; they cleared up by analogies of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the light of reason points which were still obscure and fused them into a whole, in whose parts the data of Divine Revelation and those of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were sometimes difficult to distinguish. Briefly all this led to a work of transposition, analysis, and synthesis, of deduction and induction, of the elaboration of the revealed matter by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. In the course of this work the formulas have changed, the Divine realities have become tinged with the colours of human thought, <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> have been mingled with those of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and philosophy, but the heavenly <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has remained the same throughout the varieties of formulas, systematization, and dogmatic expression. It is seen at different angles and to a certain extent with other eyes, but it is the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which was presented to the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and which is presented to us today.

<p>To this identity of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> corresponds the identity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. What the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> believed we still believe; what we believe today they believed more or less explicitly, in a more or less conscious way. Since the deposit of Revelation has remained the same, the same also, in substance, has remained the taking possession of the deposit by the living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Each of the faithful has not at all times nor has he always explicit consciousness of all that he believes, but his implicit <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> always contains what he one day makes explicit in the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, which may be called fundamental, have always been explicitly professed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> either by word or action; others which may be called secondary may have long remained implicit, enveloped, as regards their precise detail, in a more general <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> did not discern them at the first glance. In the first case at a given time uncertainties may have existed, controversies have arisen, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> cropped up. But the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense, has not hesitated as to what was essential, there has never been in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world that darkening of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have reproached it; these might have seen and they who had eyes to see did see. On these points disputes have never arisen among the faithful; there have sometimes been very sharp disputes, but they had to do with misunderstandings or bore only on details of expression.

<p>As regards <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> such as the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception, there have been uncertainties and controversies over the very substance of the subjects involved. The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was indeed in the deposit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but it was not formulated in explicit terms nor even in clearly equivalent terms; it was enveloped in a more general <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (that e.g. of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">all-holiness</a> of Mary), the formula of which might be understood in a more or less absolute sense (exemption from all actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, exemption even from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>). On the other hand, this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (the exemption of Mary from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>) may seem in at least apparent conflict with other certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> (universality of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of all by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>). It will be readily understood that in some circumstances, when the question is put explicitly for the first time, the faithful have hesitated. It is even natural that the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> should show more hesitation than the other faithful. More aware of the apparent opposition between the new opinion and the ancient <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they may legitimately resist, while awaiting fuller light, what may seem to them unreflecting haste or unenlightened <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Thus did <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> in the case of the Immaculate Conception. But the living <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Mary in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> implied absolute exemption from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without exception, even from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; the faithful whom <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> preoccupations did not prevent from beholding this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in its purity, with that <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of the heart often more prompt and more enlightened than reasoning and reflected thought, shrank from all restriction and could not suffer, according to the expression of St. Augustine, that there should be question of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatsoever in connexion with Mary. Little by little the feeling of the faithful won the day. Not, as has been said, because the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, powerless to struggle against a blind sentiment, had themselves to follow the movement, but because their perceptions, quickened by the faithful and by their own <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, grew more considerate of the sentiment of the faithful and eventually examined the new opinion more closely in order to make sure that, far from contradicting any <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, it harmonized wonderfully with other <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> and corresponded as a whole to the analogy of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and rational fitness. Finally scrutinizing with fresh care the deposit of revelation, they there discovered the pious opinion, hitherto concealed, as far as they were concerned in the more general formula, and, not satisfied to hold it as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they declared it revealed. Thus to implicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> succeeded, after long discussions, explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> thenceforth shining in the sight of all. There have been no new data, but there has been under the impulse of grace and sentiment and the effort of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> a more distinct and clear insight into what the ancient data contained. When the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> defined the Immaculate Conception it defined what was actually in the explicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the faithful what had always been implicitly in that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all similar cases, save for accidental differences of circumstances. In recognizing a new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> thereby recognizes that it already possessed that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>There is, therefore in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> progress of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, progress of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, progress to a certain extent of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself, but this progress does not consist in the addition of fresh information nor the change of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. What is believed has always been believed, but in time it is more commonly and thoroughly understood and explicitly expressed. Thus, thanks to the living magisterium and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preaching, thanks to the living sense of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to the action of the Holy Ghost simultaneously directing master and faithful, traditional <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> lives and develops in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, always the same, at once ancient and new--ancient, for the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> already beheld it to a certain extent, new, because we see it with our own eyes and in harmony with our present <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Such is the notion of tradition in the double meaning of the word; it is Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> coming down to us in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and it is the guardianship and transmission of this Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the organ of the living magisterium, by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preaching, by the profession of it made by all in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life.
