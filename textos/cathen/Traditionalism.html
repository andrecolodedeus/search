<h1>Traditionalism</h1>  

<p>A philosophical system which makes <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> the supreme criterion and rule of certitude.
<h2>Exposition</h2>

<p>According to traditionalism, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is of itself radically unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or, at least, the fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the metaphysical, moral, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order. Hence our first act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must be an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, based on the authority of revelation. This revelation is transmitted to us through <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is guaranteed by tradition or the general consent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Such is the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system maintained chiefly, in its absolute form, by the Vicomte de Bonald and <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">F. de Lamennais</a> in their respective works and, with some mitigation, by <a href="../cathen/02353a.htm">Bautain</a>, Bonetty, Ventura, <a href="../cathen/15114a.htm">Ubaghs</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>.

<p>According to de Bonald, man is essentially a social being. His development comes through <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; and the continuity and progress of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> have their principle in tradition. Now language is the instrument of sociability, and speech is as natural to man as is his social nature itself. Language could not have been discovered by man, for "man needs signs or words in order to think as well as in order to speak"; that is "man thinks his verbal expression before he verbally expresses his thought"; but originally language, in its fundamental elements together with the thoughts which it expresses, was given him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> His Creator (cf. L&eacute;gislation primitive, I, ii). These fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, moral, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of man, must be first accepted by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They are communicated through <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and warranted by tradition or universal reason of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. There is no other basis for certitude and there remains nothing, besides tradition, but human opinions, contradiction, and uncertainty (cf. Recherches philosophiques, i, ix).

<p>The system presented by <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> is almost identical with that of de Bonald. Our instruments of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, namely sense, feeling, and reason, he says, are fallible. The rule of certitude therefore can only be external to man and it can consist only in the control of the individual senses, feelings, and reasoning by the testimony of the senses, feelings, and reason of all other men; their universal agreement is the rule of certitude. Hence, to avoid scepticism, we must begin with an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> preceding all reflection, since reflection pre-supposes the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must have its criterion and rule in the common consent or agreement of all, in the general reason (<em>la raison g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</em>). "Such is", <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> concludes, "the law of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> nature", outside of which "there is no certitude, no language no <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, no life" (cf. D&eacute;fense de l'Essai sur l'Indiff&eacute;rence, xi).

<p>The Mitigated Traditionalists make a distinction between the order of acquisition (<em>ordo acquisitionis</em>) and the order of demonstration (<em>ordo demonstrationis</em>). The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of metaphysical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, they say, is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to man in order to act reasonably. It must then be acquired by the child through teaching or tradition before he can use his reason. And this tradition can have its source only in a primitive revelation. Hence, in the order of acquisition, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. With these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, however, received by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is able, through reflection, to demonstrate the reasonableness of this act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and thus, in the order of demonstration, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. When replaced in its historical surroundings, Traditionalism clearly appears as a reaction and a protest against the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the eighteenth century and the anarchic <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Against these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> it pointed out and emphasized the weakness and insufficiency of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, the influence of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and tradition on the development of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and institutions. The reaction was extreme, and landed in the opposite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.
<h2>Criticism</h2>

<p>Since Traditionalism, in its fundamental principles, is a kind of <a href="../cathen/06068b.htm">Fideism</a>, it falls under the condemnation pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and under the refutation furnished by reason and philosophy against <a href="../cathen/06068b.htm">Fideism</a>. We may, however, advance certain criticisms touching the characteristic elements of Traditionalism. It is evident, first of all, that authority, whatever be the way or agency in which it is presented to us, cannot of itself be the supreme criterion or rule of certitude. For, in order to be a rule of certitude, it must first be known as valid, competent, and legitimate, and reason must have ascertained this before it is entitled to our assent (cf. <a href="../summa/2002.htm#article1">St. Thomas, I-II:2:1</a>). Without entering upon the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> problem of the relations between thought and expression, and even admitting with de Bonald that the primitive elements of thought and language were originally given directly by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to man, we are not forced to conclude <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> with him that our first act is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Our first act should rather be an act of reason, acknowledging, by natural reflection, the credibility of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais's</a> criterion of universal reason or consent is open to the same objections. First, how could universal consent or general reason, which is nothing more than the collection of individual judgments or of individual reasons, give certitude, when each of these individual judgments is only matter of opinion or each of these individual reasons is declared to be fallible? Again, how could we in practice apply such a criterion, that is, how could we ascertain the universality of such a judgment in the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, even if only moral universality were required? Moreover, what would be, in this system, the criterion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, concerning matters in which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is not generally interested, or in the scientific problems of which it is generally incompetent? But above all, in order to give a firm and unhesitating assent to the teaching of universal consent, we must first have ascertained the reasonableness and legitimacy of its claims to our assent; that is, reason must ultimately precede <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, otherwise our assent would not be reasonable.

<p>Mitigated or Semi-Traditionalism, in spite of its apparent differences, is substantially identical with pure Traditionalism, and falls under the same criticism, since religious and moral <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are declared to be given to man directly by Revelation and accepted by him antecedently to any act of his reason. Moreover, there is no real foundation for the essential distinction between the orders of invention and demonstration, which is supposed to distinguish Semi-Traditionalism from pure Traditionalism. The difference between these two orders is only accidental. It consists in the fact that it is easier to demonstrate a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> already known than to discover it for the first time; but the faculties and process used in both operations are essentially the same, since to demonstrate a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> already known is simply to reproduce, under the guidance of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the operation performed and to take again the path followed in its first discovery (cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "De Veritate", Q. xi, a. 1). Semi-Traditionalism and absolute Traditionalism, then, rest upon the same fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, namely, that ultimately <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes reason. Let us point out, however, the partial <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in Traditionalism. Against Individualism and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, it rightly insisted upon the social character of man, and rightly maintained that authority and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> play a large part in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, moral, and religious development of man. Rightly also it recalled to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> the necessity of respect for tradition, for the experience and teaching it contains, to secure a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and solid progress Universal consent may indeed be, in certain conditions; a criterion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In many circumstances, it may furnish suggestion for the discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or afford confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> already discovered, but it can never be the supreme criterion and rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Unless we admit that our reason is of itself capable of knowing with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> some fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, we <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> end in scepticism-the ruin of both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as taught by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> and history, is that man is physically and practically able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> some fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the natural, moral, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, but that, although he has the physical power, he remains in the conditions of the present life, morally and practically incapable of knowing sufficiently all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the moral and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, without the help of Divine Revelation (cf. <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, Sess. III, cap. ii).
