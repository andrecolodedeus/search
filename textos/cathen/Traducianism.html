<h1>Traducianism</h1>  

<p>Traducianism (<em>tradux</em>, a shoot or sprout, and more specifically a vine branch made to take root so as to propagate the vine), in general the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that, in the process of generation, the human spiritual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is transmitted to the offspring by the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. When a distinction is made between the terms Traducianism and Generationism, the former denotes the materialistic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the transmission of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the organic process of generation, while the latter applies to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> according to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the offspring originates from the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in some mysterious way analogous to that in which the organism originates from the parent's organism. Traducianism is opposed to <a href="../cathen/04475a.htm">Creationism</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Both, however, against <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">Emanationism</a> and Evolutionism (q.v.) admit that the first human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> originated by creation. They differ only as to the mode of origin of subsequent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>In the early centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, the Fathers who touch upon this question defend the immediate creation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Apollinaris, and a few other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> advocate Traducianism, but the testimony of Saint Jerome (Epist. cxxvi, 1) that "the majority of Oriental writers think that, as the body is born of the body, so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is born of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" seems exaggerated, as no other writer of prominence is found to advocate Generationism as certain. <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Saint Gregory of Nyssa</a>, Macarius, Rufinus, Nemesius, although their views on this point are not always clear, seem to prefer Generationism. After the rise of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, some Fathers hesitate between Generationism and Creationism, thinking that the former offers a better, if not the only, explanation of the transmission of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Among them Saint Augustine is the most important. Creationism is held as certain by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of Saint Victor</a> and <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, who propose it merely as more probable. In recent times Generationism has been rejected by all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Exceptions are Froschammer who defends Generationism and gives to the generation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> the name of secondary creation; <a href="../cathen/08666a.htm">Klee</a> and <a href="../cathen/15114a.htm">Ubaghs</a> who leave the question undecided; <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermes</a> who favours Generationism; <a href="../cathen/06733a.htm">Gravina</a> who advocates it &#151; and <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> who asserts that the sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is generated by the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and becomes spiritual when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> illuminates it and manifests to it the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of being which is the foundation of the whole <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life.

<p>From the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> point of view, the reasons alleged in favour of Generationism have little or no value. The <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are really generators of their offspring even if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the generative process is the condition of the union of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which constitutes the human being. A murderer really kills a man, although he does not destroy his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Nor is man inferior to animals because they generate complete living organisms, since the difference between man and animals comes from the superiority of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and from its spiritual nature which requires that it should be created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand the reasons against Generationism are cogent. The organic process of generation cannot give rise to a spiritual substance, and to. say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is transmitted in the corporeal semen is to make it intrinsically dependent on matter. The process of spiritual generation is impossible. since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immaterial and indivisible, no spiritual germ can be detached from the Parental <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Contra gent." II, c 86; "Sum. theol." <a href="../summa/1090.htm#article2">I:90:2</a>, <a href="../summa/1098.htm#article2">I:98:2</a>, etc.). As to the power of creation, it is the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone (see <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">CREATION</a>, VI).

<p>Theologically, corporeal Traducianism is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> because it goes directly against the spirituality of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. As to Generationism, it is certainly opposed to the general attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Froschammer's book, "Ueber den Ursprung der menschlichen Seelen", was condemned in 1857, and <a href="../cathen/15114a.htm">Ubaghs's</a> opinion expressed in his "Anthropologiae philosophicae elementa" was reproved in a letter of Cardinal Patrizi written by authority of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> (2 March, 1866). Moreover, Anastasius II in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul (498) condemns Generationism (Thiel, "Epistolae Romanorum Pontificum", 634 sqq.). In the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Symbol</a> to be subscribed to by Bishop Peter of Antioch (1053), <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> declares the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be "not a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but created from nothing" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 348). Among the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> must reject, <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> mentions the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> originates from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the father (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 533). Hence, although there are no strict definitions condemning Generationism as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, it is certainly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and could not be held without temerity.
