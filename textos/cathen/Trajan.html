<h1>Trajan</h1>  

<p>Emperor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (A.D. 98-117), b. at Italica <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 18 September, 53; d. 7 August, 117.

<p>He was descended from an old Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and was adopted in 97 by the Emperor Nerva. Trajan was one of the ablest of the Roman emperors; he was stately and majestic in appearance, had a powerful will, and showed admirable consideration and a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> kindliness. He gained a large amount of territory for the empire and laid the foundations of civilization all over the provinces by the founding of municipal communities. He established order on the borders of the Rhine, built the larger part of the boundary wall (<em>limes</em>) between Roman and Germanic territory from the Danube to the Rhine, and with great determination led two campaigns (101-2 and 105-7) against the Dacian king, Decebalus, whose country he converted into a new province of the empire. Two other provinces were conquered, although neither <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of importance subsequently. The Governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> conquered Arabia Petraea and Trajan himself entered <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> during the Parthian War (114-7).

<p>In his internal administration Trajan was incessantly occupied in encouraging commerce and industries. The harbour of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> was enlarged and new harbours and roads were constructed. Numerous stately ruins in and around <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this emperor's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in erecting buildings for public purposes. The chief of these is the immense Forum Trajanum, which in size and splendour casts the forums of the other emperors into the shade. In the middle of the great open space was the colossal equestrian statute of Trajan; the free area itself was surrounded by rows of columns and niches surmounted by high arches. At the end of the structure was the Bibliotheca Ulpia, in the court of which stood the celebrated Trajan's Column with its reliefs representing scenes in the Dacian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Later Hadrian built a temple to the <a href="../cathen/01650b.htm">deified</a> Trajan at the end of the Forum towards the Campus Martius.

<p>Art and learning flourished during Trajan's reign. Among his literary contemporaries were Tacitus, Juvenal, and the younger Pliny with whom the emperor carried on an animated correspondence. This correspondence belonging to the years 111-3 throws light on the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> during this reign. Pliny was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the double Province of Bithynia and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. In this territory he found many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and requested instructions from Trajan (Ep. 96). In his reply (Ep. 97) Trajan considers the confession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as a crime worthy of death, but forbade a search for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and the acceptance of anonymous denunciations. Whoever shows by sacrificing to the gods that he is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is to be released. Where the adherence to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the punishment of death is to follow. The action he prescribed rests on the coercive power of the police, the right of repression of the magistracy, which required no settled form of procedure. In pursuance of these orders measures were taken against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in other places also. The most distinguished <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under Trajan were Ignatius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Simeon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Legend names many others, but there was no actual <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> on a large scale and the position of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was in general satisfactory.
