<h1>Trani and Barletta</h1>  

<p>(T<font size=-2>RANEN</font>, et Barolen.)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city of Trani is situated on the Adriatic in a fertile plain, producing cereals, wine, and oil, which are exported in great quantities. For a long time, however, the port has lost the importance it had in the time of the Norman and Angevins who fortified it. The fishing industry is extensive. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in Byzantine style, was built by Canon Nicola di Trani in 1143; its bronze gates by Barisano date from that period. Outside the city, on a peninsula, stand the old <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of S. Maria de Colonna, containing a mineral spring, the "acqua di Cristo". Trani is built on the site of the ancient Turenum. It grew in importance under the Byzantines and was taken several times by the dukes of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. In 840 and 1009 it fell into the hands of the Saracens. In the tenth and eleventh centuries it was a republic recognizing the nominal sovereignty of Byzantium. The "Ordinamenta et consuetudo maris", published in 1063 by the consuls of Trani is, after the "Tavole di Amalfi", the oldest maritime commercial code of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Trani resisted the Norman invaders energetically, but in 1073 it had to open its gates to Pierre d'Hauteville, who assumed the title of Count of Trani. In the twelfth century, in league with <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, Troia, and Melfi, it attempted to regain its ancient freedom; and in the battle of Bigano (1137) defeated Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, but two years later it had to capitulate. <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> constructed a fortress there and made it one of the royal residences. In the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> Trani became a place of the greatest importance, especially during the struggle between the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> and the Angevins. From 1497 to 1509 it was held by <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> there. In 1647 the populace rebelled against the nobles; in 1799 the people opposed the republic, and the city in consequence was sacked by the revolutionaries and the French. The legend of <a href="../cathen/09536a.htm">St. Magnus</a> relates that there was at Trani about the middle of the third century a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Redemptus, who was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/09536a.htm">St. Magnus</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whose date is known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is Eusebius who was present at the dedication of the Basilica of Monte Gargano in 493. A few other names have been preserved like Suthinius (761) and Rodostanus (983). Till then Trani had certainly followed the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> and Bishop Bernardo opposed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Partiarch Polyeuctus (968) introducing the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>; it is uncertain whether Joannes, who embraced the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael Caerularius</a> and in consequence was deposed by <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> (1059), belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. His successor was Delius, and thenceforward Trani continued in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. In 1098 St. Nicholas Pellegrino, a Byzantine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, died there; under another Byzantine the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated to that saint. Grammaro was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by Henary VI for supporting King William; Bartolommeo Brancacci (1328) distinguished himself on several embassies and was chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. Mention may be made likewise of Cardinal Latino Orsini (1438), Cosimo Migliorati (1479), Giovanni Castelar (1493), Giambernardo Scotti, a <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> (1555), who introduced the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reform, Cesare Lambertini, the canonist (1503); Diego Alvarez, O. P. (1607), the famous adversary of Molina; Tommaso de Sarria, O. P. (1656), who enlarged the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Giuseppe Antonio Davanzati (1717), who abolished many abuses. With the See of Trani is united the ancient Diocese of Salpe (Salapia of the Greeks), its known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> comprising <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> (465) and 23 successors before the definitive union in 1547. Anoather united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is that of Carnia, which had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> before the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, who entrusted it to the care of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a>; in 649 it had a new ordinary, but later the city fell into decay. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Trani has also the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, because when Palestine was lost in 1190 the title of that see was transferred to Barletta (the ancient Barduli), a seaport on the Adriatic, a little south of Trani, to which diocese it then belonged. At <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> between 1100 and 1190 there were eight <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; the names of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> resident at Barletta before 1265 are unknown. We may mention the following Bishops: Blessed Agostino Favorini (1431), General of the Augustinians, a learned writer, and Maffeo Barberini (1604), later <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. In 1455 the Diocese of Cannae, a city celebrated as the scene of Hannibal's victory (216 B.C.), was united with that of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. It was destroyed in 1083 by <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>, with the exception of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the episcopal residence. At Cannae St. Liberalis suffered martydom. It had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in ths sixth century, for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> entrusted the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to the care of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Siponto; its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are again mentioned after the tenth century. In 1534 Cannae was separated from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> and united to Monteverde, but in 1552 the united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were incorporated with <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. In 1860 the <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">See of Nazareth</a> (Barletta) was united with Trani, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of which had been appointed in 1818 perpetual administrator of the ancient See of Bisceglie, the scene of the glorious martydom of Saints Pantelemon and Sergius, whose bodies repose in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Tha names of fifty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Bisceglie are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Trani has been an archdiocese since the twelfth century. The united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> contain 19 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 98,000 inhabitants; 110 priests; 1 house of religious (men); 15 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls.
