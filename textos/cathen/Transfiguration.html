<h1>Transfiguration</h1>  

<p>The Transfiguration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the culminating point of His public life, as His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> is its starting point, and His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> its end. Moreover, this glorious event has been related in detail by <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a> (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs1">17:1-6</a>), <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a> (<a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs1">9:1-8</a>), and <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs28">9:28-36</a>), while <a href="../cathen/11752a.htm">St. Peter</a> (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs16">2 Peter 1:16-18</a>) and <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs14">1:14</a>), two of the privileged witnesses, make allusion to it.

<p>About a week after His sojourn in <a href="../cathen/03135a.htm">C&aelig;sarea Philippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> took with him <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> and led them to a high mountain apart, where He was transfigured before their ravished eyes. <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a> and <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a> express this phenomenon by the word <em>metemorphothe</em>, which the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> renders <em>transfiguratus est</em>. The <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a> explain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the word by adding "his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow," according to the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, or "as light," according to the Greek text.

<p>This dazzling brightness which emanated from His whole Body was produced by an interior shining of His Divinity. False <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> had rejected the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, and now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, represented by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, recognized and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> Him, while for the second time <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> proclaimed Him His only-begotten and well-loved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. By this glorious manifestation the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Master</a>, who had just foretold His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs21">Matthew 16:21</a>), and who spoke with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> of the trials which awaited Him at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, strengthened the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his three friends and prepared them for the terrible struggle of which they were to be witnesses in <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Gethsemani</a>, by giving them a foretaste of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly delights</a> to which we attain by suffering.
<h2>Location of the Transfiguration</h2>

<p>Already in <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> times the mount of the Transfiguration had become the "holy mount" (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs18">2 Peter 1:18</a>). It seems to have been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> of the country, and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> identified it with <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Thabor</a>. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> said (A.D. 231-54) "Thabor is the mountain of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was transfigured" (Comm. in Ps. lxxxviii, 13). In the next century <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../fathers/310102.htm"><em>Catechetical Lectures</em> II.16</a>) and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (<a href="../fathers/3001046.htm">Epistles 46</a>, <a href="../fathers/3001053.htm">53</a> and <a href="../fathers/3001108.htm">108</a>) likewise declare it categorically. Later <a href="../cathen/12449b.htm">St. Proculus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (d. 447; Orat. viii, in Transfig.), <a href="../cathen/01204a.htm">Agathangelus</a> (Hist. of Armenia, II, xvii), and Arnobius the Younger (d. 460; Comm. in Ps. lxxxviii, 13) say the same thing. The testimonies increase from century to century without a single dissentient note, and in 553 the <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Fifth Council of Constantinople</a> erected a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Thabor</a> (Notitif. Antioch. . . . patriarch.).

<p>Some modern writers claim that the Transfiguration could not have taken place on <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Thabor</a>, which, according to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, was then surmounted by a city. This is incorrect; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> historian speaks neither of a city nor a village; he simply fortified, as he repeats three times, "the mount called Itabyrion" ("Bell. Jud.", II, xx, 6; IV, i, 8; Vita, 37). The town of Atabyrion of Polybius, the Thabor or Celeseth Thabor, the "flank of Thabor" of the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bible</a>, is situated at the foot of <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Thabor</a>. In any case the presence of houses on a wooded height would not have made it impossible to find a place apart.

<p>It is again objected that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was transfigured on <a href="../cathen/07288a.htm">Mount Hermon</a>, since He was at that time in its vicinity. But the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a> are all explicit concerning the lapse of time, six days, or about eight days including those of departure and arrival, between the discourse in <a href="../cathen/03135a.htm">C&aelig;sarea</a> and the Transfiguration, which would infer a somewhat lengthy journey. Moreover the summits of <a href="../cathen/07288a.htm">Hermon</a> are covered with snow as late as June, and even the lesser peaks of 4000 or 5000 feet are likewise snow-covered in February and March, the period of the Transfiguration. Finally, the ancients judged of the height of mountains by their appearance, and <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Thabor</a> especially was considered a "high mountain", if not by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a>, at least by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who made the ascent.
