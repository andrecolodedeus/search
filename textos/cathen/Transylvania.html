<h1>Transylvania</h1>  

<p>(Also TRANSYLVANIENSIS or ERDELY).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, suffragan of Kalocsa B&aacute;cs. The foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is attributed to King St. Stephen, but it was probably established by King <a href="../cathen/08737a.htm">St. Ladislaus</a>, patron of Transylvania; Simon (1103-13) was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The episcopal residence is at Gyula-Feh&eacute;rvar (Alba Julia) in Als&oacute;-Feh&eacute;r.

<p>The original limits of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> varied somewhat from the present boundaries, as they included the County of M&aacute;rmaros, while the provostship of Szeben was exempt and some parts of the Szekler country were subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Milkovia in <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> received rich donations from King B&eacute;la IV, Charles Robert, Louis I, and Sigismund. The diocese suffered greatly during the reign of B&eacute;la IV from the Tatar invasion, and during the civil disturbances under his successors, but recovered very quickly in the fourteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was again imperilled by the advance of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, but its decay did not set in until the sixteenth century, and was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the progress of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, in consequence of which the exempt provostship of Szeben ceased to exist, and by internal disturbance in Transylvania. It flourished again under <a href="../cathen/09735a.htm">Cardinal Martinuzzi</a>, but after his assassination in 1551 it decayed rapidly. The advance of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> led, in 1556, to the secularization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, which was, however, re-established by Prince Stephen B&aacute;thory. After the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> flourished again, but only while the house of B&aacute;thory continued to rule. Bishop Demetrius N&aacute;pr&aacute;gyi was forced to leave the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and in 1601 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Gyula-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r, which had been founded in the thirteenth century, was taken and held by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> until the eighteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> not regaining possession of it until the reign of Charles III.

<p>When the Principality of Transylvania lost its independence, the decrees against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were withdrawn, but the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and chapter were not re-established until 1713. The succession to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> had been kept up regularly till 1713, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> resided abroad. The exempt provostship of Szeben was incorporated in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, which was completely restored under <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> in 1771. Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who filled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> after 1713, the following may be mentioned: Ignatius Count Batthyany (1780-98), who founded the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at Gyula-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r, whic is named after him; Alexander Rudnay (1816-19), later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>; <a href="../cathen/07161b.htm">Louis Haynald</a> (1852-64), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Kalocsa. Count Gustavus Majl&aacute;th has occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> since 1897. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains: 16 archdeaconries; 10 titular <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>; 2 titular provostships; 229 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 398 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 226 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; 30 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men and 17 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number 354,145. There are 103 patrons. The chapter consists of 10 active members and of 6 titular canons. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are to a certain extent autonomous, i.e., certain church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> matters are managed by mixed boards, partly <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a>, partly lay. This autonomy dates back to the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; it ceased in 1767 with the establishment of the <em>Commissio catholica</em> by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, and was re-established as late as 1873. The control is exercised by the general assembly of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> estates and a managing committee.
