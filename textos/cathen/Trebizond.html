<h1>Trebizond</h1>  

<p>(TRAPEZUNTINA).

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> diocese. The city owes its ancient name to the fact that it was built on the shores of the Black Sea in the form of a trapeze. It was a Greek colony from Sinopus, established in the eighth century, B.C., and not a colony from Trapezus, in Arcadia, as Xenophon relates, who was received here with enthusiasm during the retreat of the Ten Thousand. After having formed a part of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, and then of that of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, it fell into the hands of the Romans, and was declared a free city by Pompey. The <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> adorned it and endowed it with great commercial importance by creating its artificial harbor. Under <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> took and pillaged it; its inhabitants were slain or sent as slaves to the Cimmerian Bosphorus. Justinian raised it from its ruins and thenceforth it became rich in monuments, especially churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In 1204 when Constantinople fell into the power of the Latins, a prince of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Comneni, who in 1185 sought safety in Iberia, proclaimed himself Emperor of Trebizond under the name of Alexis, and founded a Greek empire, the rival of that of Nicaea. The new state comprised nearly all of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> Polemoniacus and stretched eastward as far as the River Phasis. It was in perpetual conflict with the Seljuk <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and later with the Osmanli <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, as well as with the Greeks of Nicaea and Constantinople, the Italian republics, and especially the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>. During the two centuries and a half in which it succeeded in subsisting the Empire of Trebizond contributed greatly to the development of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization and Greek literature in those distant parts, until then somewhat backward. In 1462 Trebizond was taken by assault by the troops of Mohammed II, and its last emperor, David, was exiled to the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/13731a.htm">Serrae</a> in <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. He was soon <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to choose between embracing <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> or forfeiting his life; he kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and was executed together with six of his children. The seventh fled to the Peloponnesus where he founded the Comneni of Morea. From 1204 to 1462 Trebizond had, in all, twenty emperors.

<p>At present Trebizond is the capital of the vilayet of the same name, bounded by those of Sivas and Erzeroum, the Black Sea, and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, which after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1877 absorbed a part of its territory. The vilayet measures about 270 miles from west to east by 65 miles at its extreme length; its area is 11,275 sq. miles. Its total population may be estimated at 900,000. The city itself has 50,000 inhabitants, among whom are 12,000 Greeks, 10,000 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, some <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and a few hundred <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> The remainder are <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, Lazis, Circassians, and Afghazis. Trebizond has a citadel, at least 40 mosques, 10 Greek churches, some of which have preserved ancient <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, several <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> churches, etc.; it carries on an active trade with <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries by way of the black Sea. Close to the city are several Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> still inhabited, and which played a certain part in Byzantine history.

<p>The first traces of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at Trebizond are found under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> when St. Eugenius, still the patron of the city, St. Canoeists, and their companions were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of whom mention is still made were the Bishop St. Basil, tenth century (feast, 20 October), and St. Theodore Gabras, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> about 1098 (feast, 2 October). At first merely a suffragan of Neoc&aelig;sarea in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> Polemoniacus Trebizond became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of Lazica when the ancient <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, Phasis, was lost by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. At the end of the ninth century it had seven suffragans, which number continued to increase. The emperors of Trebizond profited by their political situation to secure privileges for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of their capital. By an official act of 1 January, 1260, the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Nicaea, at the request of Michael VIII Paleologus, recognized a semi-independence of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Trebizond. Thenceforth the titulars of this city went neither to Nicaea nor Constantinople to receive episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> from the patriarch; it was given them in their own church in the presence of a delegate from the patriarch who assisted at, or, if he were a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, presided at the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. But the patriarch reserved to himself as formerly the ordinations of the other <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> or the autocephalous <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of the empire. Of course after the suppression of the Empire of Trebizond in 1462 the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of this city lost these privileges and were made like all the other <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, in which condition they are at present. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christ., I, 509-14) gives a list of eighteen Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Trebizond, to which other names might be added. Among them Domnus, the oldest known, who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> in 325; Atarbius, at Chalcedon in 451; Anthimus, the future <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, who deposed Pope St. Agapitus in 536; Dorotheus, who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1439), and signed its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of union; Cyril, who in 1653 was in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Pere Goar, and made a profession of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. To these may be added the Bishop Ouranios who, according to an inscription (C.I.G., 8636), restored buildings in the year 542. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, because of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> merchants and also because of the missionaries who went to evangelize the Khazars, Comans, and Tatars, a <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was established at Trebizond. The oldest-known titular was a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Andronicus Comnenus, mentioned in 1289. In <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (op. cit. III, 1097-1100) and in Eubel (Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, I, 520) will be found the names of several other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from 1344 to 1437. The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> must have lasted until the capture of the city by Mohammed II.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> diocese erected in 1850 by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, is of vast extent; it has 4300 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 4 churches, 7 stations, 4 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 9 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and 4 <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a>. There are also <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Marsivan and Amasia, engaged exclusively with the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>; the Oblates of the Assumption are at <a href="../cathen/01380c.htm">Amasia</a> for the same object. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> are established for the Latins at Trebizond, Samsun, and Ineboli, and are dependent on the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">delegate Apostolic</a> at Constantinople; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of the Apparition have a boarding-school at Trebizond.
