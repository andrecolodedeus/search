<h1>Trent</h1>  

<p>(TRIDENTUM; TRIDENTINA).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. Trent became universally known through the famous <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">general council</a> held there from 1545 to 1563. At an earlier date, however, it had a certain historical importance. In 15 B.C. its territory became subject to the Romans. As early as 381 there appeared at the Council of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> Abundantius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Trent. While <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and the barbarian invasions elsewhere smothered the seed of the gospel, it grew in Trent under the care and protection of <a href="../cathen/15426c.htm">St. Vigilius</a>. Bishop Valerian of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the youthful Vigilius, while the great <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose of Milan</a> had instructed him as to his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in lengthy, fatherly, epistles. Vigilius came to his end prematurely; he was stoned to death when barely forty years of age.

<p>In the sixth century during the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> controversy, the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Aquileia continued in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> even after Popes Vigilius and <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pelagius I</a> had recognized the decrees of the Council of Constantinople; through the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Trent also persisted in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Placed between <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Trent was exposed to the influences of both. Ecclesiastically it remained subject to Aquileia until 1751, but in political affairs it could not withstand the power of the Salic and Saxon kings and emperors. Under the first Franconian king, Bishop Ulrich II became an independent prince of the empire, with the powers and privileges of a duke. In consideration of imperial favour the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Trent sided with Henry IV and Frederick I during the great struggle between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Empire, but in such a skilful manner so as to avoid a rupture with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Bishop Adelbert is even revered as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, although he sided with the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Victor IV</a>, who had been chosen by the emperor; in those times of confusion it was often difficult to find the right path. He died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (1177). Under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, Friedrich von Wanga raised Trent to the height of its power and influence. He was a great temporal and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ruler. He used every means to kindle and strengthen the religious spirit, and began the building of the splendid Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He died at Acre in 1218 during the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a>.

<p>The untimely death of Meinhard III, son of Margaret of Tyrol, brought Trent under the rule of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1363. In 1369 Rudolph IV concluded a treaty with Bishop Albrecht II of Ortenburg, by virtue of which Rudolph became the real sovereign of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> promised in his own name and in that of his successors to acknowledge the duke and his heirs as lords, and to render assistance to them against their enemies. Thereafter Trent ceased to be an independent principality, and became a part of the Tyrol. Ortenburg's successor was George I of Liechtenstein, who endeavoured to regain its independence for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His efforts involved him in several <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, terminated only by his death in 1419. More than once during these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> he was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, while the duke was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a>.

<p>The much discussed story of the death of St. Simon of Trent belongs to the reign of Prince-Bishop Johannes IV Hinderbach. On <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> of the year 1475, the little child, then about 20 months old, son of a gardener, was missed by its <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. On the evening of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> the body was found in a ditch. Several <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who were accused of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, were cruelly tortured.

<p>The sixteenth century was a time of trouble and worry for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Tyrol. In the towns the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, in the villages and among the peasants the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, multiplied. After many ineffectual efforts, the sovereign, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and several monastic orders combined their authority, and a new order set in, which reached its climax in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">council</a> Cardinal Christoph von Madrutz was prince-bishop. He was succeeded by three members of his house, with the last of whom the house of Madrutz died out. The decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">council</a> were executed but slowly. In 1593 Cardinal Ludwig von Madrutz founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which later was conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">Somaschi</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> came to Trent in 1622.

<p>Peter Vigil, Count of Thun, governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> during the Josephite reforms, with which he was in sympathy. He abolished some of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in his territory, interfered with the constitutions of the various orders, and closed some churches. When the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> ceased to exist in 1751, Trent became exempt. During the administration of his successor, Emmanuel Maria Count of Thun, it ceased to be an independent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principality (1803). The <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government insisted on the following: (1) <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> only after an examination at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; (2) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to order their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to obey all orders of the Government in connection with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> police; (3) when filling <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> a list of three names was to be presented by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the Government or by the Government to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; (4) recourse to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or combination with other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was forbidden. Bishop Emmanuel replied that he would remain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to support and defend the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that he would rather suffer all the consequences which might arise from his refusal rather than act against his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. He was expelled in 1807 and crossed the frontier into <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> at Reichenhall. He could only return after the Tyrolese had freed themselves of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> yoke. After the Peace of Viena negotiation were begun relative to the circumscription of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the Tyrol, and were concluded in 1825. Trent was made a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, instead of being chosen by the chapter, were appointed by the emperor. The 115th <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Trent was <a href="../cathen/15079b.htm">Johann Nepomuk Tschiderer</a>. He died on 12 March, 1860, and his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> is already under way. The diocese numbers 602,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 1072 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 817 male religious, and 1527 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.
