<h1>Trenton</h1>  

<p>(T<font size=-2>RENTONENSIS</font>).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> created 15 July, 1881, suffragan of New York, comprises Atlantic, <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Salem, Somerset, and Warren counties in the <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">State of New Jersey</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> an area of about 5,756 square miles. From 1808 to 1853 the territory now occupied by the Diocese of Trenton covered the lower sections of what was then known as East and West Jersey, the former belonging to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of New York and the latter to Philadelphia. In 1853 the <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Diocese of Newark</a> was formed, and the entire <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">State of New Jersey</a> was placed under Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. The Diocese of Trenton lies between New York and Philadelphia and has within its confines all the sea coast from Sandy Hook to Cape May Point, whereon thirty churches have been built to accommodate the summer visitors to the Jersey coast. The first Mass said within its territory was celebrated at Woodbridge, about 1672, and the city of Trenton, in 1814, witnessed the formation of the first congregation and the erection of the first church.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the Right Rev. Michael Joseph O'Farrell (b. at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 2 December, 1832; d. 2 April, 1894). Bishop O'Farrell completed his classics and philosophy at <a href="../cathen/01314b.htm">All Hallows College</a>, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and went to St-Sulpice, Paris, where he made his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> course. He became a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in his native city by the Most Rev. Dr. Ryan, 18 Aug., 1855. His superiors sent him to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where he taught <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> at the Grand Seminary. He left the Congregation of St-Sulpice and was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Peter's Church, New York City. He took up the work of organizing the new diocese of Trenton with fifty-one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, sixty-nine churches, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about forty thousand. Soon new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions were formed, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> was opened at New Brunswick, and a home for the aged at Beverly. At the Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> Bishop O'Farrell was considered one of the most eloquent speakers in the American <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. He wrote pastoral letters on <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. His remains were at first <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> cemetery, Trenton, but in 1905 were transferred to a vault in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Michael's Orphan Asylum, Hopewell, New Jersey.

<p>Bishop O'Farrell was succeeded by his chancellor and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the Right Rev. James Augustine McFaul (b. near Larne, Co. Antrim, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 6 June, 1850), the second and present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Trenton. The latter went with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to America when a few months old. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> dwelt for several years in New York City and then moved to Bound Brook, New Jersey. Bishop McFaul made his collegiate course at St. Vincent's, Beatty, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a>, <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies being made at Seton Hall, South Orange, New Jersey. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 26 May, 1877, and, when the See of Trenton was erected, was appointed an assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at St. Mary's church, Trenton, which Bishop O'Farrell selected as his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Hence he early became a friend of his predecessor, by whom he was held in great confidence and by whom he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Church of St. Mary, Star of the Sea, Long Branch. In October, 1890, he returned to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to be its <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and to assist the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He was made secretary and chancellor, and on 1 November, 1892, was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. On the death of Bishop O'Farrell he acted as administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and on 20 July, of the same year, was raised to the episcopate, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Mary's Cathedral (18 Oct., 1894) by <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, from whom, when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, he received all his other orders. Being familiar with the diocese he soon placed it on a splendid financial basis, and erected many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and institutions, among which are: the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, at Hopewell; the home for the aged, at Lawrenceville; and Mount St. Mary's College for young ladies, at Plainfield. Bishop McFaul is organizer of the American Federation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Societies, which has a membership of about two million.

<p>Among the most widely known of Bishop McFaul's works are his pastoral letters, "The Christian Home", "The Christian School", and "Some Modern Problems", as well as a timely and valuable brochure on tuberculosis. His address on "The American Universities", delivered in New York City, June, 1909, revealed to the American people the fact that the professors of several of these institutions were advancing <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in conflict with morality and the established standards of right and wrong. In May, 1911, he delivered an address on the Press before several thousand newspaper men, in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City.

<p>In the Diocese of Trenton there are many nationalities, and the Gospel is preached in the following languages: English, German, Italian, <a href="../cathen/12196a.htm">Polish</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a>, Slovak, Lithuanian, and Rumanian.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: men &mdash; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>), Augustinians, Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/12107a.htm">Pious Society of Missions</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Brothers of the Sacred Hearrt, and <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> (summer only); <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, Sisters of Charity, Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, Sisters of St. Francis, Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, Gray Nuns, <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>, School Sisters of Notre-Dame, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>, Pious Teachers (<em>Pii Filippini</em>), Sisters of the Precious Blood.
