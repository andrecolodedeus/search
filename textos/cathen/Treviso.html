<h1>Treviso</h1>  

<p>(TARVISINA).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Venetia (Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>). The capital is surrounded by the River Sile; its environs are the favourite summer resort of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> nobility.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, erected in 1141, was transformed in 1485 by Tullio and Pietro Lombardo, and modernized in 1758 with five <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a>; the entrance portal dates from 1835. It contains <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by the brothers Bregno and by Antonio Lombardo; <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bourdone, <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, and Francesco di Dominicis; frescoes by <a href="../cathen/13687d.htm">Seitz</a>, <a href="../cathen/12280a.htm">Pordenone</a>, etc.; and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Canon Malchiostro and the Bishop Zanetti. The Church of S. Nicol&ograve;, designed in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style by Fra Nicolo da Smola, was erected by <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, who presented it to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. It now belongs to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which occupies the ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maddalena; it has <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Paolo Veronese</a>.

<p>Among the civil buildings is the Palazzo dei Trecento (1184) containing the Galleria Comunale with pictures by <a href="../cathen/09367a.htm">Lotto</a>, Tintoretto, <a href="../cathen/02684b.htm">Bordone</a>, Bellini. Natives of Treviso were: the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> <a href="../cathen/02684b.htm">Paris Bordone</a>, Pier Maria and Girolamo Pennacchi; the historian Odorigo Rinaldi (Raynaldus), continuator of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>; the jurist Bartolommeo Zuccati; the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Francesco Turchi, mathematician and architect; and the poet <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a>.

<p>Tarvisium was an ancient city of the Veneti, which became Roman in 183 B.C. and was a stronghold of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> in the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Through the intercession of Bishop Felix the city was spared during the Lombard invasion (569) and became the seat of a duchy. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> made it a marquisate, extending from Belluno to <a href="../cathen/03519b.htm">Ceneda</a>, and from the Adige to the Tagliamento. In 922 Treviso, which was under episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, was sacked by the Hungarians. In 1014 it was organized as a commune ruled by consuls, with a council of three hundred citizens. A member of the Lombard league, it later made peace with <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, who respected its constitution, but appointed as podesta (1173) Ezzellino il Monaco. He was expelled, and thereafter the Ezzelini and Da Canino took turns in the office. Notwithstanding a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Padua, Belluno, and Feltre, the city flourished through its riches, commerce, and the spirit of its inhabitants. Released from the tyranny of Ezzelino IV (1231-50), Treviso was an independent commune until Emperor Henry VII in 1309 made Riccardo da Canino imperial vicar. He was treacherously slain and succeeded by his son Guecello, against whom a conspiracy was formed. In 1314-18 Can Grande della Scala of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> annexed Treviso to his state, but the inhabitants revolted to Frederick the Fair of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and afterwards to Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>. Meanwhile, Guecello Tempesta was proclaimed ruler and liberator of the city (1328), but after four years he induced the citizens to recognize the supremacy of Can Grande. Becoming involved in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, Treviso was ceded to that city (1338), captured by Leopold of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1383), sold to the Carrar, lords of Padua, taken by Gian Galezzo Visconti, Duke of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1404), and finally returned to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. In 1848 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> troops at Treviso, commanded by Ferrari, sustained a siege by the Austrians. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, established at Treviso in 1317 by Frederick the Fair, did not flourish. The republic of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> maintained the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> until the conquest of Padua (1405), with its great <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, resulted in closing the one at Treviso.

<p>Treviso probably received the Gospel from <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of certain date was Jucundus, who in 421 took part in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the church of the Rialto in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Treviso who participated in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> were: Felix (see above); Rusticus, present at the Council of Murano (588); and Felix II, who signed the petition to the Emperor Maurice. In 905 Bishop Adelbert received from King Berengar the temporal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the city, which extended to Rozo (969- 1001) and Rolando who adhered to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>. Bishop Tiso (1212-45) suffered from the tyranny of Ezzelino, and Alberto Ricco, O. M. (1255), was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for preaching against him. Successive <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Loto Gambacurta (1394), exiled by the Florentines from his <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>; Giovanni Benedetti, O. P. (1418), who reformed many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of his order and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinary</a> priests; Ludovico Barbo (1437), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of S. Giustina of Padua, and reformer of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> order; Ermolao Barbaro (1443), a learned and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>; Cardinal Pietro Riario, O. M. (1471); Fra Giovanni Dacri (1478), formerly general of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and reorganized the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, leaving many <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> foundations; Nicol&ograve; Franco (1486), <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> in various countries; Francesco Cornaro (1577), who founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, introduced the reforms of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; Gian Antonio Lupo (1646), who conflicted with his canons; Giambattista Saniedo (1684), <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and beneficent <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>; Fortunato Morosini (1710), who enlarged the Seminary; Bernardino Marini (1788-1817), a canon of the Lateran, present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1811, who united the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <em>nullius</em> of Novisa with the See of Treviso; and Giuseppe Giapelli, appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government, but not recognized by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, so that the diocese remained in turmoil until the death of the candidate.

<p>In 1818 Treviso passed from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> (Udine) to that of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Bishop Giuseppe Grasser (1822) healed the evils caused by the interregnum, Bishop Antonio Farina (1890) conferred <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a> on Giuseppe Sarto, now <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>. United with Treviso is the ancient Diocese of Asolo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of which are unknown from 587 (Agnellus) until 1049 (Ugo), and that of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a> (Citt&agrave; Nova), a city founded in the times of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, as a refuge for the inhabitants of Opitergium (Oderzo), who with their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Magnus) had been exiled by the Lombards. Twenty-six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are known, from 814 until the union of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> with Treviso, 1440. The Diocese of Treviso has 215 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 386 secular and 30 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, 27 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for boys, five for girls, and 414,330 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
