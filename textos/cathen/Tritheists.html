<h1>Tritheists</h1>  

<p>(TRITHEITES).

<p>Heretics who divide the Substance of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>.

<p>(1) Those who are usually meant by the name were a section of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, who had great influence in the second half of the sixth century, but have left no traces save a few scanty notices in <a href="../cathen/08470c.htm">John of Ephesus</a>, Photus, Leontius, etc. Their founder is said to be a certain John Ascunages, head of a <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">Sophist</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Antioch. But the principal writer was John Philoponus, the great <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> commentator. The leaders were two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Conon of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and Eugenius of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> in Isauria, who were deposed by their comprovincials and took refuge at Constantinople. There they found a powerful convert and protector in <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> the Monk, a grandson of the Empress Theodora. Philoponus dedicated to him a book on the Trinity. The old <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> pleaded his infirmities when he was summoned by Justinian to the Court to give an account of his teaching. But Conon and Eugenius had to dispute in the reign of Justin II (565-78) in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> patriarch, John Scholasticus (565-77), with two champions of the moderate <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> party, Stephen and Paul, the latter afterwards <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. The Tritheist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> refused to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> Philoponus, and brought <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that he agreed with Severus and Theodosius. They were banished to Palestine, and Philoponus wrote a book against John Scholasticus, who had given his verdict in favour of his adversaries. But he developed a theory of his own as to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">EUTYCHIANISM</a>) on account of which Conon and Eugenius wrote a treatise against him in collaboration with Themistus, the founder of the Agnoctae, in which they declared his views to be altogether unchristian. The two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> together with a deprived <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Theonas proceeded to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, which they established in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and Athens, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Africa, and in the Western Patriarchate, while their agents travelled through <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Cilicia, Isauria and Cappadocia, converting whole districts, and ordaining <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> in cities villages, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Eugenius died in Pamphylia; Conon returned to Constantinople. We are assured by Leontius that it was the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a> of Philoponus which made him teach that there are in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> three partial substances (<em>merikai ousiai, ikikaitheotetes, idiai physeis</em>) and one common. The genesis of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has been explained (for the first time) under <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">MONOPHYSITES</a>, where an account of Philoponus's writings and those of Stephen Gobarus, another member of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, will be found.

<p>(2) In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> <a href="../cathen/13189c.htm">Roscellin of Compiegne</a>, the founder of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, argued, just like Philoponus, that unless the Three Persons are tres res, then the whole Trinity must have been incarnate. He was refuted by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>.

<p>(3) Among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, Pierre Faydit, who was expelled from the Oratory at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1671 for disobedience and died in 1709, fell into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Tritheism in his "Eclaireissements sur la doctrine et Phistoire eccl&eacute;siastiqes des deux premiers siecles" (Paris, 1696), in which he tried to make out that the earliest Fathers were Tritheists. He was replied to by the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbot Louis-Charles Hugo ("Apologie du syst&egrave;me des Saints P&egrave;res sur la Trinit&eacute;," Luxemburg, 1699). A canon of Tr&egrave;ves named Oembs, who was infected with the doctrines of the "Enlightenment", similarly attributed to the Fathers his own view of three similar natures in the Trinity, calling the numerical unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> an invention of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. His book, "Opuscula de Deo Uno et Trino" (Mainz, 1789), was condemned by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 14 July, 1804. Gunther is also accused of Tritheism.

<p>(4) Among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, Heinrich Nicolai (d. 1660), a professor at Dantzig and at Elbing (not to be confounded with the founder of the Familisten), is cited. The best known is William Sherlock, Dean of St. Paul's, whose "Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity" (London, 1690) against the <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a> was attacked by Robert South in "Animadversions on Dr. Sherlock's Vindication" (1693). Sherlock's work is said to have made William Manning a <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinian</a> and Thomas Emlyn an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, and the dispute was ridiculed in a skit entitled "The Battle Royal", attributed to William Pittis (1694?), which was translated into Latin at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>. Joseph Bingham, author of the "Antiquities", preached at Oxford in 1695 a sermon which was considered to represent the Fathers as Tritheists, and it was condemned by the Hebdomadal Council as <em>falsa, impia et haeretica</em>, the scholar being driven from Oxford.
