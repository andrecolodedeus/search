<h1>Troyes</h1>  

<p>(TRECENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the Department of Aube. Re-established in 1802 as a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, it then comprised the Departments of Aube and Yonne, and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had the titles of Troyes, Auxerre, and <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne</a>. In 1822 the See of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> was created and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Troyes lost that title. When Sens was made an archdiocese the title of Auxerre went to it and Troyes lost also the Department of Yonne, which became the <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Archdiocese of Sens</a>. The Diocese of Troyes at present covers, besides the ancient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> limits, 116 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the ancient <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a>, and 20 belonging to the ancient <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Diocese of Sens</a>. Since 1822 Troyes is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>

<p>The catalogue of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Troyes, known since the ninth century, is in the opinion of Duchesne, worthy of confidence. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Amator, seems to have preceded by a few years Bishop Optatianus who probably ruled the diocese about 344. Among his successors are: St. Melanius (Melain) (390-400); <a href="../cathen/15230a.htm">St. Ursus</a> (Ours) (426); St. Lupus (Loup) (426-478), b. in 383, who accompanied <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, forced the Huns to spare Troyes, was led away as a hostage by <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a> and only returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> after many years of exile; St. Camelianus (479-536); St. Vincent (536-46); St. Leuconius (Leucon) (651-56); St. Bobinus (Bobin) (750-66), previously <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Monstier la Celle; St. Prudentius (845-61), who wrote against <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> and Johannes <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>; Blessed Manasses (985-93); Jacques B&eacute;nigne Bossuet (1716-42, nephew of the <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">great Bossuet</a>; Etienne-Antoine de Boulogne (1809-25); Pierre-Louis C&aelig;ur, the preacher (1849-60).

<p>Louis the Stammerer in 878 received at Troyes the imperial crown from the hands of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a>. At the end of the ninth century the counts of Champagne chose Troyes as their capital. In 1285, when <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> united Champagne to the royal domain, the town kept a number of privileges. John the Fearless, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and ally of the English, aimed in 1417 at making Troyes the capital of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and he came to an understanding with Isabeau of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, wife of Charles VI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, that a court, council, and parliament with comptroller's offices should be established at Troyes. It was at Troyes, then in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, that on 21 May, 1420, the treaty was signed by which Henry VI of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to Catherine, daughter of Charles VI, and was to succeed him to the detriment of the dauphin. The dauphin, afterwards Charles VII, and <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a> recovered the town of Troyes in 1429.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Troyes is a fine Gothic structure begun in the twelfth, and completed in the fifteenth, century; the ancient collegiate Church of St. Urban is a Gothic building whose lightness of treatment reminds one of La Sainte Chapelle at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It was built by <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> at the close of the thirteenth century. He was a native of Troyes and on one of the <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained-glass</a> windows he caused his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to be depicted, working at his trade of tailor. The Abbey of Nesle la Riposte was founded before 545 near Villenauxe, perhaps by Queen Clotilde. In the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> caused to be rebuilt at Villenauxe, with the actual stones which they brought from Nesle, the original doorway of Nesle Abbey, an interesting monument of French history. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> undertook to interpret its carvings, among which might be seen the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of a <em>reine p&eacute;dauque</em> (i.e. a web-footed queen) supposed to be St. Clotilde. The Abbey of Notre Dame aux Nonnains, founded by St. Leucon, was an important <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> and St Bernard corresponded with its abbesses. At his installation the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> went to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> on the previous evening; the bed he slept on became his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but the mule on which he rode became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> led the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the hand into the chapter hall; she put on his <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, offered him his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a>, and in return the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> promised to respect the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> in the eighteenth century made a great noise over the pretended cure by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of Marie Madeleine de M&eacute;grigny, a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> of Notre Dame aux Nonnains. The part of the Diocese of Troyes which formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a> contained the famous <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Abbey of Clairvaux</a>. Concerning the Abbey of the Paraclete, founded by <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> and in which the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Heloise died in 1163, and where her body and that of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> were buried until 1792, see <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">ABELARD</a>. On 20 June, 1353, Geoffroy de Charny, Lord of Savoisy and Lirey, founded at Lirey in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Annunciation a collegiate church with six <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a>, and in this church he exposed for veneration the Holy Winding Sheet. Opposition arose on the part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Troyes, who declared after due inquiry that the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was nothing but a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and opposed its exposition. <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> by four <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, 6 Jan., 1390, approved the exposition as lawful. In 1418 during the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the canons entrusted the Winding Sheet to Humbert, Count de La Roche, Lord of Lirey. Margaret, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Humbert, never returned it but gave it in 1452 to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. The requests of the canons of Lirey were unavailing, and the Lirey Winding Sheet is the same that is now exposed and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> (see <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">TURIN</a>).

<p>Among the many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> or connected with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: St. Mathia, virgin, period uncertain; her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were found in Troyes in 980; St. Helena, virgin, whose life and century are unknown, and whose body was transferred to Troyes in 1209; these two are patronesses of the town and diocese; St. Oulph, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (second or third century); St. Savinianus, Apostle of Troyes; St. Patroclus (Parre), St. Julius, St. Claudius, and St. Venerandus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a>; St. Savina, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>; St. Syra, the wonder-worker (end of third century); St. Ursion, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Isle Aumont (c. 375); St. Exuperantia, a religious of Isle Aumont (c. 380); St Balsemius (Baussange), <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, apostle of Arcis-sur-Aube, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in 407; St. Mesmin and his companions and Saints Germana and Honoria, martyred (451) under <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>; St. Aper (Evre), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, and his sister Evronia, natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (towards the close of the fifth century); St. Aventinus, disciple of St. Loup (d. c. 537); <a href="../cathen/13163a.htm">St.Romanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, founder of the Monastery of SS.
