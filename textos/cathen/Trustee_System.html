<h1>Trustee System</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>In the exercise of her inherent right of administering <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> often appoints deputies who are responsible to herself. Technically, such administrators, whether cleric or lay, are called the "fabric" of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In very early times <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods were divided into three or four portions, and that part set aside for the upkeep of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> began to take on the character of a juridical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The Eleventh <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (can. ii) in 407 requested the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> to appoint five executors for <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were called on to take their share in this administration, with the understanding, however, that everything was to be done in the name and with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A number of early and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> have dealt with the administration of curators of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, e.g. can. vii, Conc. Bracar. (563); can. xxxviii, Conc. Mogunt. (813); can. x, Conc. Mogunt. (847); can. xxxv, Conc. Nation. Wirceburg. (1287). The employment of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> in concert with <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> as trustees became common all over <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> such officials were called churchwardens. They were generally two in number, one being chosen by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the other by the parishioners, and with them were associated others called sidesmen. The churchwardens administered the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> under the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to whom they were responsible. An annual report on the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> was made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in all countries by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXII, can. ix, "De Ref."): "The administrators, whether <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or lay, of the fabric of any church whatsoever, even though it be a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, as also of any <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, confraternity, charitable institution called <em>mont de pi&eacute;t&eacute;</em>, and of any <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> places whatsoever, shall be bound to give in once a year an account of their administration to the Ordinary."
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>At the present time, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nowhere absolutely forbids the employment of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> in the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, but endeavours, generally by means of <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a>, to have her own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and principles carried out on this subject when <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> are among the trustees. According to the present discipline, the fabric of the church is distinct from the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, and sometimes the fabric, in addition to the goods destined for the upkeep of divine worship, possesses also <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and eleemosynary institutions (S.C.C., 27 Apr., 1895, in caus. Bergom.). All lay trustees must be approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and he retains the right of removing them and of overseeing the details of their administration. In countries in which the church organization was entirely swept away in the troubles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period, as in the British Isles, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> are not generally employed as trustees at the present day. For the trustee System, as far as it can be called such, in use in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> see <a href="../cathen/14466a.htm">Taunton</a>, "The Law of the Church", pp. 15, 316. In <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were admitted to a share in the administration of church temporalities by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (21 July, 1856). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to nominate the members of the board, over which the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is to preside. Trustees hold office for four years and may be reappointed at the expiration of that term. When a vacancy occurs the board presents two names to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, from which he selects one. In <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> cases the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may dismiss any member and even dissolve the entire board of trustees. In this instance, as in all others where <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> are in question, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is careful to guard the prescriptions of the sacred canons as to the management and ownership of church goods [see <a href="../cathen/01144a.htm">ADMINISTRATOR (OF ECCLESIASTICAL PROPERTY)</a>].
<h2 id="section3">III</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the employment of lay trustees was customary in some parts of the country from a very early period. Dissensions sometimes arose with the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has intervened to restore peace (see <a href="../cathen/04349a.htm">HENRY CONWELL</a>; <a href="../cathen/11793b.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF PHILADELPHIA</a>; <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK</a>). <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> vindicated (24 Aug., 1822) the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as against the pretensions of the trustees, and <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> declared (12 Aug., 1841): "We wish all to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the office of trustees is entirely dependent upon the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that consequently the trustees can undertake nothing except with the approval of the ordinary." The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (Tit. IX, no.287) laid down certain regulations concerning trustees: It belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to judge of the necessity of constituting them, their number and manner of appointment; their names are to be proposed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>; the appointment is to be made in writing and is revocable at the will of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; the trustees selected should be men who have made their <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, who contribute to the support of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who send their children to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and who are not members of prohibited <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>; nothing can be done at a board meeting except by the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> who presides; in case of disagreement between the trustees and the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be accepted. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of the Council (29 July, 1911) declares that the vesting of the title to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in a board of trustees is a preferable legal form, and that in constituting such boards in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the best method is that in use in New York, by which the Ordinary, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> form the corporation (see <a href="../cathen/12472a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL PROPERTY IN THE U.S.</a>).
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The legal standing of church trustees according to British law is treated by <a href="../cathen/14466a.htm">Taunton</a>, "The Law of the Church", pp.15, 315. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the legal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of trustees vary slightly in different States, but the following prescriptions (selected from Scanlan, "The Law of Church and Grave") hold almost everywhere: When the statute provides that two lay members of the corporation shall be appointed annually by the committee of the congregation, the members of the congregation have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect said two members, and those appointed in the proper manner are lawful officers. When the election of new trustees is invalid, the old trustees hold over until there shall have been a valid election of their successors. The president and secretary of a church corporation have no authority to make a promissory note unless authorized by the board of trustees. When the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the organization give control of matters to the board of trustees, the majority of the members of the church cannot control the action of the trustees contrary to the uses and regulations of the church. A court has no authority to control the exercise of the judgment or discretion of the officers of a church in the management of its funds so long as they do not violate its constitutions or by-laws. <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a> does not always remove an officer of a church corporation. The legal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in regard to the temporalities of a church, where they are not prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, must rest, if at all, upon the ecclesiastical law, which must be determined by evidence. When <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is conveyed to a church having well-known <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and practice, a majority of the members has not the authority or power, by reason of a change of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> views, to carry the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> thus designated to a new and different <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The title to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> is in that part of the congregation which acts in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the denomination; and the ecclesiastical laws and principles which were accepted before the dispute began are the standard for determining which party is right.
