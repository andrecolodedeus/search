<h1>Tryphon, Respicius, and Nympha</h1>  

<p>Martyrs whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> on 10 November. Tryphon is said to have been born at Kampsade in Phrygia and as a boy took care of geese. During the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> he was taken to Nicfa about the year 250 and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in a horrible manner after he had converted the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> prefect Licius. Fabulous stories are interwoven with his legend. He is greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> which observes his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 1 February. In this Church he is also the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of gardeners. Many churches were dedicated to him, and the Eastern Emperor, Leo VI, the Philosopher (d. 912), delivered a eulogy upon Tryphon. About the year 1005 the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Theodoric of Fleury wrote an account of him based upon earlier written legends; in Theodoric's story Respicius appears as Tryphon's companion. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of both were preserved together with those of a holy virgin named Nympha, at the Hospital of the Holy Ghost in Sassia. Nympha was a virgin from Palermo who was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for the Faith at the beginning of the fourth century. According to other versions of the legend, when the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> invaded <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> she fled from Palermo to the Italian mainland and died in the sixth century at <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a>. The feast of her translation is observed at Palermo on 19 August. Some believe that there were two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this name. The church of the Hospital of the Holy Ghost at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> title which, together with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, was transferred in 1566 by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> to the Church of St. Augustine. A Greek text of the life of St. Tryphon was discovered by Father Franchi de Cavallieri, Hagio-graphica (Rome, 1908), in the series <em>Studi e Texti</em>, XIX. The Latin Acts are to be found in Ruinart, <em>Acta Martyrum</em>. <em>Analecta Bollandiana</em>, XXVII, 7-10, 15; XXVIII, 217.
