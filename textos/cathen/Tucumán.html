<h1>Tucum&aacute;n</h1>  

<p>(T<font size=-2>UCUMANENSIS</font>).

<p>Suffragan to <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>, erected from the <a href="../cathen/13404a.htm">Diocese of Salta</a> on 15 February, 1897, comprises the Province of Tucum&aacute;n (area 8926 sq. miles; population 325,000), in the north-west of the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine Republic</a>. The first and present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Pablo Padilla y B&aacute;rana (b. at Jujuy, 25 Jan., 1848), was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11646a.htm">Pentacomia</a> (17 Dec., 1891), transferred to <a href="../cathen/13404a.htm">Salta</a>, (19 Jan., 1893), and to Tucum&aacute;n (16 Jan., 1898). The episcopal city, Tucum&aacute;n, or San Miguel de Tucum&aacute;n (population 80,000), is situated on the Rio Dulce, 780 miles north-west of <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>, and was founded in 1565 by Diego de Villaruel; a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was opened there in 1586. In 1680 Tucum&aacute;n replaced Santiago del Estero as capital of the province. The Spanish forces were utterly defeated at Tucum&aacute;n in 1812 by the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentinos</a> under Belgrano, whose <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> has been erected in the city to commemorate the victory. One of the most interesting monuments in Tucum&aacute;n is Independence Hall, where the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine</a> delegates proclaimed (9 July, 1816) the R&iacute;o de la Plata provinces free from Spanish domination. Of the twenty-seven members forming this National Congress fifteen were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (as were two other delegates who were unavoidably absent, and the secretary of the assembly, Jos&eacute; Agust&iacute;n Molina, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Camaco <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/13404a.htm">Salta</a>); two of the fifteen were afterwards raised to episcopal rank &mdash; Jos&eacute; Colombres (Salta) and Justo Santa Mar&iacute;a de Oro (Cuyo). It is to be noted that the See of C&oacute;rdoba, founded in 1570, was generally referred to in the seventeenth century as that of Tucum&aacute;n (C&oacute;rdoba de Tucum&aacute;n).

<p>On 21 January, 1910, the Province of Catamarca (area 47,531 sq. miles; population 107,000), which till then had been a vicariate forane of Tucum&aacute;n, was erected into a separate see under Mgr. Bernab&eacute; Piedrabuena (b. at Tucum&aacute;n, 10 Nov., 1863; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cestrus and coadjutor to Mgr. Padillo, 31 May, 1908; transferred to Catamarca, 8 Nov., 1910). Before the separation, Tucum&aacute;n had 15 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 67 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and Catamarca 15 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 96 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; there were 60 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, assisted by <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and Fathers of Our Lady of Lourdes; there was a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 3 students of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and 60 rhetoricians; 7 <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students were studying at <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a> and the Collegio Pio-Latino, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; in addition there were two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges at Tucum&aacute;n and one at Catamarca; there were communities of the Hermanas Esclavas, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Good Shepherd, and Josephine Sisters. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily paper is published at Tucum&aacute;n and two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weeklies at Catamarca. A large number of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have the usual <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sodalities and con-fraternities. Workingmen's circles are established in the two episcopal cities. Catamarca (San Fernando de Catamarca), lying 230 miles north-north-west of C&oacute;rdoba, contains 8000 inhabitants. It was founded in 1680 by Fernando de Mendoza. The National College, which has a chair of mineralogy, is located in the old Merced Convent. Most of the inhabitants of the Province of Catamarca are mestizos, descendants of the Quilene, Cilian, Andagala, and Guafare Indians. Cholla (a suburb of Catamarca) is inhabited by Calchaqui Indians, but Spanish is now the only language spoken.
