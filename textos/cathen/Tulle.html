<h1>Tulle</h1>  

<p>(TUTELENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the Department of Correze. It was suppressed by the Concordat of 1802, which joined it to the <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">See of Limoges</a>, but was theoretically re-established by the Concordat of 1817, and <em>de facto</em> re-erected by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 6 and 31 October, 1822. It is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. According to legends which grew up in later years around the <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> cycle, that saint, who had been sent by St. Peter to preach, is said to have restored to life at Tulle the son of the governor, Nerva, and to have covered the neighbouring country with churches. By some of the legends <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a> is made founder of the Abbey of Tulle; by others, St. Calmin, Count of Auvergne (seventh century). Robbed of its possessions by a powerful <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, it recovered them in 930 through the efforts of a member of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Viscount Adhemar, who left a reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. St. Odo, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, reformed it in the tenth century. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 August, 1317, raised it to episcopal rank; but the chapter remained subject to monastic rule and was not secularized until 1514. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Tulle were: Hugues Roger, known as Cardinal de Tulle (1342-43), who was never <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and lived with his brother <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>; Jean Fabri (1370-71), who became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1371; Jules Mascaron, the preacher (1671-79), who was afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01209b.htm">Agen</a>; L&eacute;onard Berteaud, preacher and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> (1842-78). St. Rodolphe of Turenne, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, who died in 866 founded, about 855, the Abbey of Beaulieu in the Diocese of Tulle. The Charterhouse of Glandier dates from 1219; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Uzerche was founded between 958 and 991; Meymac Priory, which became an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1146, was founded by Archambaud III, Viscount de Conborn.

<p><a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> on his way to Limoges from <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (1095) passed near Tulle. <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> dwelt for a time at Brive, towards the end of October, 1226; and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Grotto of Brive is the only existing one in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of that saint. Pierre Roger, who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, was a native of Maumont in the diocese. In 1352 the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> was disputed between Jean Birel, general of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Glandier, and Etienne Aubert, who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, and was a native of Ch&acirc;teau-des-Monts in the Diocese of Tulle. In 1362 Hugues Roger, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Tulle, brother of <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, refused the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>; in 1370 Pierre Roger, his nephew, became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>. At Tulle and in Bas (Lower) Limousin, every year, on the vigil of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, a feast is kept which is known as <em>le tour de la lunade</em> (the change of the moon); it is a curious example of the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was able to sanctify and Christianize many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> customs. Legend places the institution of this feast in 1346 or 1348, about the time of the Black Death. It would seem to have been the result of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. M. Maximin Deloche has shown that this legend is baseless; that the worship of the sun existed in Gaul down to the seventh century, according to the testimony of <a href="../cathen/05386a.htm">St. Eligius</a>, and that the feast of St. John's Nativity, 24 June, was substituted for the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> festival of the summer solstice, so that the <em>tour de la lunade</em> was an old <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> custom, sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which changed it to an act of homage to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in, or connected with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, besides those already mentioned, are: St. Fereola, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (date uncertain); St. Martin of Brive, disciple of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (fifth century); St. Duminus, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> (early sixth century); at Argentat, St. Sacerdos, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a> when he retired into solitude (sixth century); St. Vincentianus (Viance), <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> (seventh century); St. Liberalis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Embrun, died in 940 at Brive, his native place; St. Reynier, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Beaulieu, died at the beginning of the tenth century; St. Stephen of Obazine, b. about 1085, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for men at <a href="../cathen/11181a.htm">Obazine</a>, and that for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> at Coyroux; St. Berthold of Malefayde, first general of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and whose brother Aymeric was <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (twelfth century). Etienne <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a>, the learned historian (1638-1718), was a native of Tulle, and the missionary <a href="../cathen/02686c.htm">Dumoulin Borie</a> (1808-38), who was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in Tonquin, was born in the diocese. The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame-de-Belpeuch, at Camps, dating from the ninth or tenth century; Notre-Dame-de-Chastre at Bar, dating from the seventeenth century; Notre-Dame-du-Pont-du-Salut, which goes back to the seventeenth century; Notre-Dame-du-Roc at Servieres, dating from 1691; Notre-Dame-d'Eygurande, dating from 1720; Notre-Dame-de-La-Buissiere-Lestard, which was a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> before the seventeenth century; Notre-Dame-de-La-Chabanne at Ussel, dates from 1140; Notre-Dame-de-Pennacorn at Neuvic, dating from the end of the fifteenth century.

<p>Before the application of the Law of 1901, the Diocese of Tulle contained <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, and many teaching congregations of Brothers. The teaching Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary had their mother-house at Triegnac. The religious congregations were in charge of 6 nurseries, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys, 5 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 1 Good Shepherd Home, 1 home for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, 15 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices, 10 district nursing institutions, and 1 <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">lunatic asylum</a>. At the time of the breach of the Concordat in 1905 the diocese had 318,422 inhabitants, 34 first-class <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 255 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 71 curacies supported by the State.
