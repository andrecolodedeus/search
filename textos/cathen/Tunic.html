<h1>Tunic</h1>  

<p>By tunic is understood in general a <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a> shaped like a sack, which has in the closed upper part only a slit for putting the garment over the head, and, on the sides, either sleeves or mere slits through which the arms can be passed. The expressions under-tunic or over-tunic are used accordingly as the tunic is employed as an outer vestment or under another. A tunic that reaches to the feet is called a gown tunic (<em>tunica talaris</em>, Gr. <em>poderes</em>); a tunic without sleeves or with short sleeves is called <em>colobium</em>; one which leaves the right shoulder free, <em>exomis</em>. By tunic (<em>tunicella</em>) is understood in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> upper <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> which corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. According to present usage the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> and tunic are alike both as regards form and ornamentation. They also agree in the manner of use as well as in the fact that the tunic, like the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, is one of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> worn at the <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It is unnecessary here to go into full details, but it will suffice in regard to form, ornamentation, and use to refer to what is said under <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>. As regards the form, according to the directions of the <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum"</a>, the tunic should be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> by narrower sleeves, but this is hardly observed even in the pontifical tunic, which is worn under the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself puts the tunic on the newly-ordained <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> with the words: "May the Lord clothe thee with the tunic of joy and the garment of rejoicing. In the name", etc.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>According to a letter of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Saint Gregory the Great</a> to Bishop John of Syracuse, the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a> tunic was, for a time, customary at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as early as the sixth century. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> however suppressed it and returned to the older usage. From this time on, therefore, the Roman <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> once more wore the <em>planeta</em> (<a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>) as the outer garment until, in the ninth century, the tunic again came into use among them as the outer vestment. As early as the sixth century <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a> tunic was worn in Spian, which according to the ninth canon of the synod of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, was hardly or not at all distinguishable from the diaconal tunic, the so-called <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>. No notice of a tunic worn by <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> has been preserved from the pre-Carolingian era in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, yet such a vestment was undoubtedly in use in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. There is certain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its use in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom at the beginning of the ninth century, both from the testimony of Amalar of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and from various inventories. About the close of the year one thousand the tunic was so universally worn by <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> upper vestment that it was briefly called <em>vestis subdiaconalis</em> or <em>subdiaconale.</em> As early as the first Roman Ordo the tunic is found as one of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> pontifical vestments under the name of <em>dalmatica minor, dalmatica linea.</em> The Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> also wore it under the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, while only the tunic and not the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> was part of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress of the Roman <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priests</a> and hebdomadal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> also the pontifical vestments frequently included only the tunic, not tunic and <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> together, or, as was more often the case, the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> without the tunic. Not until the twelfth century did it become general for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to wear both vestments at the same time, that is, the tunic as well as the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>. The granting to <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the privilege of wearing the tunic as well as the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, is very seldom mentioned, and even then not until the second half of the twelfth century. Before this era <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> never received more than the privilege of wearing the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> wore the tunic as early as the ninth century; in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom it was probably customary in some places in the tenth century for <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> to wear the tunic; it was worn by <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> at <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a> towards the close of the tenth century. In the late <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the wearing of the tunic by <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> was a widespread custom. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a> the tunic was called by various names. Besides <em>tunica</em>, it also bore the name of <em>tunicella</em>; <em>dalmatica minor</em>; <em>dalmatica linea</em>, or simply <em>linea</em>; <em>tunica stricta</em>, or merely <em>stricta</em>; <em>subdiaconale</em>; <em>roccus</em>; <em>alba</em>; and, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> <em>subtile.</em>

<p>As to the original form of the vestment, it was at first a tunic in the shape of a gown with narrow sleeves and without the vertical ornamental strips (<em>clavi</em>). The material of which it was made was linen for ordinary occasions, but as early as the ninth-century inventories silk tunics are mentioned. The development that the vestment has undergone from the Carolingian period up to the present time has been in all points similar to that of the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>; during the course of this development the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> and the tunic steadily decreased. Silk gradually became the material from which the tunic was regularly made; It grew continually shorter, and slits were made in the sides which, by the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, went the length of entire side up to the sleeve. Finally, outside of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the sleeves were also slit, just as in the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> which, already in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, was hardly to be distinguished from the tunic, especially as in the meantime the red <em>clavi</em> of the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> had been replaced by another form of ornamentation, which was also adopted for the tunic. When in the course of the twelfth century a canon was developed respecting the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colours, the canon was naturally authoritative for the tunic as well as for the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> and <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the use of the tunic at Mass corresponded throughout to that of the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> consequently discussion of it here is unnecessary. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> places the tunic upon the newly-ordained <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> had its origin in the twelfth century, but even in the thirteenth century it was only customary in isolated cases. It was not until the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that the usage was universally adopted in the rite of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>. As to the origin of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a> tunic it was, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a copy of the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, in which the vertical trimming of the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> was omitted, and the sleeves were made narrower.

<p>The tunic (<em>stickaphion</em>) worn by the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> does not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a> tunic of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, which from the beginning had the fixed character of an outer tunic, but resembled the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, even though, according to present custom, it is no longer exclusively white, but often coloured.
