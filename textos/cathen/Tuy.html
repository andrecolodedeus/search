<h1>Tuy</h1>  

<p>(Tudensis.)

<p>Suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the Archdiocese of Santiago, comprises the civil provinces of <a href="../cathen/11295b.htm">Orense</a> and Pontevedra, is bounded on the north by Pontevedra, on the east by Orense, on the south by <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. The city has a population of 3000, and is of very ancient origin. Ptolemy calls it Toudai and attributes its foundation to Diomedes, son of Tydeus (just as the foundation of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> is attributed to Ulysses). During the Roman period it belonged to the <em>conventus juridicus</em> or judicial district of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>. The city seems to have been at first situated on the top of Mount Alhoya whence it was moved to its base, where it was in the time of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>. When King Egica shared the government with his son Wittiza he made him live at Tuy, probably at the site known as <em>Pazos de Reyes</em> (palaces of the kings). The See of Tuy is very ancient; one of the four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Galicia at the first Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (561) was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tuy. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Anila who attended the second Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (572); he signed as suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a>. Neuphilias lived under the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> King Leovigild, by whom he was exiled and the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Gardingus put in his place. Gardingus <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> at the third Council of Toledo. Anastasius was present at the fourth and sixth Councils of Toledo; Adimirus at the seventh; and Beatus sent the cleric Victorinus to represent him at the eighth. Genetivus was present at the third Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (675) as a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, and also at the twelfth Council of Toledo. Oppa was present at the thirteenth, and Adelphius at the fifteenth.

<p>Tuy fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mahommedans</a>, but was not entirely destroyed as it is numbered among the cities reconquered by Alfonso I, but not recolonized until the time of Ordono I. The exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tuy took refuge in Iria (Compostella), and a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was assigned to him for his support. The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tuy after the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasion is Diego (890-901), present at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the Church of St. James the Apostle (899), also at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11363a.htm">Oviedo</a> in which this see was raised to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> (900). Hermoigius founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Crist&oacute;bal of Labrugia, resided in Tuy, and in 915 began the reconstruction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. At the battle of Valdejunquera he was made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and taken to Cordova where he was forced to leave as a hostage his nephew, St. Pelagius, a child of thirteen. The latter suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in defence of his chastity; his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transferred to Oviedo and he was declared the patron of Tuy. Naustianus (926) retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Labrugia to avoid the assaults of the Norsemen who had come up as far as Tuy along the River Mi&ntilde;o. His successor, Vimaranus (937-42), retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> Rivas de Sil, as did the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Viliulfus (952-70). The Norsemen led by Olaf were encamped at different times at Tuy and ravaged it cruelly (1014), on which account Alfonso V placed it under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Compostella. Bishop Alfonso I and his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had been made captive, and thereafter, until the time of Do&ntilde;a Urraca, a sister of Alfonso VI, a period of forty-seven years, the See of Tuy was vacant. Do&ntilde;a Urraca re-established it and made Jorge (Georgius) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He took up his residence in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Bartolom&eacute;, whose <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 Jan., 1071. Bishop Adericus (1072-95) succeeded Jorge. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, by concession of Raymond of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and Alfonso VII, were lords of the city, and Bishop Alfonso II began building the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was finished a hundred years later by Esteban Egea (1218-39). In the time of Bishop Pelayo Mel&eacute;ndez (1131-55) the canons adopted the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who deserve special mention are: Lucas de Tuy, called "El Tudense", <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> of Do&ntilde;a Berenguela, to whom we owe the compilation known as the "Cronic&oacute;n de Espa&ntilde;a"; Juan Fern&aacute;ndez de Sotomayor, councillor of Queen Do&ntilde;a Mari&aacute; de Molina, who was present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1312); and Prudencio de Sandoval, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, celebrated <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> caused a division in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Tuy, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> giving allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, others to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whom Portugual also obeyed. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> commanded the latter to recognize the legitimate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and when some resisted this order their churches were allowed to be governed by vicars residing in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1441). The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which is dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, resembles a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> fortress, as it is built on the crown of the ancient castle fort (<em>Castellum Tude</em>). It belongs to the early Gothic period and, on account of its height, the importance of its side <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, its clerestory (now walled up, but preserving its ancient arches and columns), the interior is well worthy of note. The ground plan is that of a Latin cross (the four arms being extremely short) with four <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, those on the side terminating in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of San Telmo (San Pedro Gonzalez), built by Bishop Diego de Torquemada (1564-82) who transferred to it the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, is worthy of note. Between the altar of the Visitation and that of the Seven Dolours is the unique sepulchre of Lope de Sarmiento (d. 1607). To the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is attached a handsome Gothic <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. The churches of the old <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> have been converted into <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> being used for a barracks and that of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> for primary and secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Tuy has a fine <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> (built by Bishop Rodr&iacute;guez Casta&ntilde;on) and a home for the aged in charge of the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which is dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> and the Immaculate Conception, was founded in 1850 by Bishop Francisco Garcia Casarrubios y Melgar. Among the illustrious men of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be mentioned St. Teutonius, the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> Alvaro Cadaval y Sotomayor, and Francisco Avila y La Creva, author of a history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.
