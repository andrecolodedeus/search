<h1>Tyre</h1>  

<p>(TYRUS.)

<p>Melchite archdiocese and <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> diocese. The city is called in Hebrew, <em>Zor</em>, and in Arabic, <em>Sour</em>, from two words meaning rock. It is very ancient. If we are to believe <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Melkart quoted by Herodotus (II, 44) it was founded in the twenty-eighth century B.C. Isaias himself (<a href="../bible/isa023.htm#vrs7">23:7</a>) says that its origin was ancient. According to the authors cited by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Ant. jud., VIII, iii, 1) and according to Justin (Hist., xviii, 3) its foundation dates from the thirteenth century B.C., but this is manifestly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, for Tyre is mentioned under the name of <em>Sour-ri</em> in the <a href="../cathen/14477d.htm">tablets of El-Amarna</a>, between 1385 and 1368 B.C. (Revue Biblique, 1908, 511). King Abimelech was then reigning there independently, though his capital was much coveted by the Egyptians, who forced the Tyrians to ally themselves with their neighbours, especially the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> (see <a href="../bible/sir046.htm#vrs21">Sirach 46:21</a>). Ancient writers, particularly Isaias (<a href="../bible/isa023.htm#vrs12">23:12</a>), call Tyre "daughter of <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a>", that is, they make it a colony of the latter city. Despite objections which have been made to this, the statement is correct, and on its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> Sidon claims to be the mother of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo Regius</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, of Tyre etc. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in a short time the colony overshadowed the mother, but the inhabitants continued to call themselves Sidonians. On the other hand, it is impossible to state which of the two cities, Palaetyrus, on the sea-coast, or Tyrus, built on a rocky island 1968 feet above the sea, existed first. It is generally held, however, that the continental preceded the insular city. The reference in Josue (xix, 29) is not exactly identified, but in the <a href="../cathen/14477d.htm">El-Amarna Letters</a> the island is referred to, unless the Egyptians who occupied all the seaboard cities had not subjected it also to their dominion.

<p>Tyre seems always to have had kings, like the other <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> cities. It was its sovereigns who made it the "queen of the sea", as it <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to call itself, and its merchants nobles of the earth, as Isaias says (<a href="../bible/isa023.htm#vrs3">23:3-8</a>). The city was very proud of its wealth and ships, which plied along the whole of the Mediterranean coast, in Africa as well as in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of Tyre became almost as proverbial among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> as that of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>. King Hiram was one of its greatest sovereigns. He sent to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the stone-cutters and carpenters to build his palace (<a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#vrs11">2 Samuel 5:11</a>), and to Solomon Lebanon <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a> and cypress wood for the construction of the Temple (<a href="../bible/1ki009.htm#vrs11">1 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch002.htm#vrs3">2 Chronicles 2:3 sq.</a>). The architect and his master workmen were Tyrians. In return Solomon gave Hiram the district of Cabul (Chabul) in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, which included twenty small cities, but the gift seems not to have been to the taste of the King of Tyre (<a href="../bible/1ki009.htm#vrs11">1 Kings 9:11-14</a>). Nevertheless, the two kings were allies and their combined fleets left the ports of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> for <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a> and Tharsis to obtain gold (<a href="../bible/1ki009.htm#vrs26">1 Kings 9:26-28</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki010.htm#vrs11">10:11 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch009.htm#vrs10">2 Chronicles 9:10, 21</a>). Hiram accomplished great works in his capital. He united the two parts of the island hitherto separated by a canal which to a certain extent made them two cities, and besides he built a great aqueduct which brought the waters of Ras- el-Ain to the land.

<p>Shortly afterwards court intrigues disturbed the city and gave rise to a bloody revolution. Phalia, an intruder, usurped the power; he was dethroned in turn by his brother Ithobael or Ethbael, high <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Astarte, a goddess who, with the god Melkart, was much <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in Tyre. It was Ethbael's daughter, <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, who married <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab, King of Israel</a>. <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> was undoubtedly a Tyrian princess; Menander in <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> ("Ant. jud.", VIII, 13:2; "Contra Appionem", I, 18; also <a href="../bible/1ki016.htm#vrs31">1 Kings 16:31</a>) calls her father "Kind of the Sidonians", another allusion to the Sidonian origin of Tyre. In 814 B.C. a group of Tyrians went to the coast of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and founded Carthage, the most famous colony of Tyre. The very amicable relations of Tyrians and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did not last always; they waned especially when Tyre sold as slaves the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelitish</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (<a href="../bible/joe003.htm#vrs4">Joel 3:4-8</a>; <a href="../bible/amo001.htm#vrs9">Amos 1:9</a>). On the other hand, the luxury and corrupt <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> which prevailed in the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> city could not but have a baneful influence on the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">tribe of Aser</a> and other <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>; so that the Prophets, such as Isaias (<a href="../bible/isa023.htm">23</a>), Ezechiel (<a href="../bible/eze026.htm">26</a>-<a href="../bible/eze029.htm">29</a>), Joel (<a href="../bible/joe003.htm#vrs4">3:4-8</a>), and Amos (<a href="../bible/amo001.htm#vrs9">1:9</a>), never ceased to thunder against it and predict its ruin. Salmanasar, King of Assur, and Sargon besieged it in vain for five years after the fall of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>; although they cut the aqueduct of Hiram and compelled the people of <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a> and Palaetyrus to place their fleets at their service, that of the Tyrians completely vanquished them (Josephus, "Ant. Jud.", IX, xiv, 2). Sennacherib likewise attempted the siege in vain. Although paying him a light tribute, Tyre remained a powerful state with its own kings (<a href="../bible/jer025.htm#vrs22">Jeremiah 25:22</a>; <a href="../bible/eze027.htm">Ezekiel 27</a> and <a href="../bible/eze028.htm">28</a>), and was enabled to develop its mercantile proclivities and attain the great prosperity spoken of by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and all ancient writers. On his return from his expedition against <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Asarhaddon, like his predecessors, blockaded Tyre, but the Tyrians, isolated on their rock, with their powerful fleet and valiant mercenaries, laughed at all his efforts. After having received tribute from King Bael, Asarhaddon was compelled to retire. The same was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> after a severe blockade lasting thirteen years. According to custom the Tyrians offered him a light tribute, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the proud sovereign was declared satisfied. Nevertheless, this long isolation greatly injured the Tyrians, for during this interval a portion of the commerce passed to Sidon and other <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> and Carthaginian peoples. Furthermore, the Tyrian colonies, which for thirteen years had broken all links of subjection to the mother country, were in no wise eager to resume the yoke. Finally, as King Ithobael had died during the siege, regents had assumed the authority (Josephus, "Contra App." I, 21) and caused many trouble, as did also the <em>dikastai</em>, or Suffetes, elected for seven years. The monarchy was subsequently restored.



<p>As the domination had passed from the Chaldeans to the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, Tyre, a vassal or rather an ally of the former, readily assumed the same relations with the latter and continued to prosper. The Tyrians with their numerous ships assisted Xerxes against the Greeks, who moreover were their commercial rivals, and Darius against Alexander the Great. The King of Tyre himself fought in the Persian fleet. Tyre refused submission to the Macedonian hero, as well as authorization to sacrifice to the god Melkart, whose temple was on the island; Alexander, taking offence, determined to capture the island at any cost. The siege lasted seven months. While the fleets of the submissive Cypriots and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a> blockaded the two ports at north and south, Alexander, with materials from Palaetyrus, which he had just destroyed, built an enormous causeway 1968 feet long by about 197 feet wide which connected the island with the continent. He then laid siege to the ramparts of the city which on one side reached a height of 150 feet. Tyre was captured in 332; 6000 of its defenders were beheaded, 2000 crucified, more than 30,000 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, children, and servants sold as slaves. Although Alexander razed the walls, the city was restored very quickly, since seventeen years later it held out for fourteen months against Antigonus, father of Demetrius Poliorcetes. From the power of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Tyre in 287 passed under the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucids</a> in 198 B.C., obtaining self-government from them in 126 B. c. This year begins the era special to Tyre. <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> was the first to rob it of its liberty (Dion Cassius, LIV, 7), for by his command its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> ceased to bear the inscription "autonomous". Various monuments were erected during the Roman period. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a> built a temple and adorned the public places. A colony under <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, Tyre subsequently became the capital of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>; at the time of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> it was regarded as the richest and greatest commercial city of the province (Comment. in <a href="../bible/eze026.htm#vrs6">Ezekiel 26:6</a>; <a href="../bible/eze027.htm#vrs1">27:1</a>). Its factory of purple cloth was foremost in the empire. It was a curious fact that under one of the predecessors of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, Dorotheus, a learned <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Antioch, the master of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, was appointed director without having to renounce his religion (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.32</a>).

<p>In A.D. 613 the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Tyre formed a vast conspiracy against the Greek Empire, and subsequently ransomed from the troops of Chosroes numerous captive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in order to sacrifice them. In 638 the city fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Baldwin I, King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, besieged it in vain from 29 Nov., 1111, till April, 1112. Baldwin II captured it, 27 June, 1124, after five months' siege and made it the seat of a countship. When the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> lost the <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a> in 1187 by the defeat of <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, Tyre remained in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and became one of their chief fortresses. There in 1210 John of Brienne was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king, and in 1225 his daughter Isabella was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> queen. Tyre was captured in May, 1291, after the fall of Saint-Jean-d'Acre, by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, who completely destroyed it, and it was never wholly restored afterwards. Occupied by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1516 it has always belonged to them, save for a brief appearance of the French in 1799. It is now a caza of the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>. The city has 6500 inhabitants, of whom 4000 are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> of various races, 200 Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 350 <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, 1750 <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 25 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and about 100 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, established since 1866, have a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls; two other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys are kept by a <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the religious of Saint-Sauveur; the Russians have a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and the American <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have one for boys and one for girls. Sour is no longer an island, but a peninsula; Alexander's causeway had grown larger as a result of sand formations, and is now an isthmus, one mile and a quarter wide. There are still to be seen the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> city wall and a portion of the church of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>, built by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> and measuring 213 feet by 82 feet. It is generally regarded as containing the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Conrad de Montferrat, slain in the street by two members of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Assassins (1192), and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick Barbarossa</a> (d. 1190). However, a German deputation sent by Bismarck in 1874 to conduct excavations discovered nothing.

<p>Among the glories of Tyre were: Ulpianus, the celebrated jurisconsult, slain at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the praetorians in 228; the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Porphyry, whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> name was Malchus (b. 233; d. 304), the determined enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, against whom he wrote a work in fifteen books; some hold that he was born not at Tyre, but at Balanaia; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who was not born at Tyre, but who died there in 253 in consequence of the tortures which he underwent under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, and was buried in the church destroyed under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>; St. Methodius, spoken of by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tyre under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, was in reality <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11249a.htm">Olympus</a> in Lycia, and died about 311; as for Dorotheus, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and the author of a work on the Apostles and the seventy disciples, he never existed, and the work is a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> compiled in the eighth century by a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> of Byzantium.

<p>Although the corruption of Tyre had become proverbial in the time of Christ (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs21">Matthew 11:21 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs13">Luke 10:13 sq.</a>), there were Tyrians eager to hear the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and who came as far as the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> to listen to Him. (<a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs8">Mark 3:8</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs17">Luke 6:17</a>). This is perhaps why <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went to the neighbourhood of Tyre to cure the sick and convert sinners (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs21">Matthew 15:21-29</a>; <a href="../bible/mar007.htm#vrs24">Mark 7:24-31</a>). A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was formed there at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and St. Luke visited and where they remained seven days (<a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs3">Acts 21:3-7</a>). About 190 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this city was directed by Bishop Cassius, who with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Ptolemais, <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, and Aelia assisted at the council held in Palestine to deal with the Paschal controversy (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.25</a>). About 250 we know of the Bishop Marinus mentioned in a letter of <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, op. cit., VII, 5). About 250 we know of the Bishop Marinus mentioned in a letter of <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, op. cit., VII, 5). The community suffered greatly during the last <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. After the edict of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> the church was burnt and was only rebuilt after religious peace had been obtained. It was <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> who pronounced the discourse at the dedication of the new basilica and who describes the oldest basilica known to us (op. cit., X, 4). Tyrannius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tyre, was captured and drowned at Antioch (op. cit., VIII, 13). <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> himself assisted in the amphitheatre of this city at the execution of five <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin (op. cit., VIII, 7). In 306 St. Ulpianus was shut up with a dog and an asp in a calfskin and thrown into the sea (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, "De Martyr. Paleaestinae" V, 2). At Caesarea Maritima one of the first victims was St. Theodosia, a young Tyrian girl of eighteen, who was horribly tortured and then thrown into the sea on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, 2 April, 307 (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.1</a>). In 311 a municipal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> forbidding <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to stay in the city was posted up in Tyre, together with a message of congratulations from the Emperor Maximin (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250109.htm"><em>Church History</em> IX.7</a>). This did not prevent the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Tyre from subsisting and developing after peace was granted to the disciples of Christ.

<p>Shortly afterwards Tyre furnished <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> with its first and greatest missionary, St. Frumentius, who went to Africa with a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who was his master and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that country. Three councils were held at Tyre. The first, convened by Constantine (335), which had about 310 members, judged the cause of St. Athanasius, who was in Tyre with 48 <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and after a series of injustices it deposed him. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> presided over the assembly (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, "Hist. des conciles", I, 656-66). Another council was held in February, 449, to examine the cause of Ibas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, who was accused by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of his church and absolved by this council. This sentence had serious consequences at Chalcedon and especially at the <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Council of the Three Chapters</a> in 553 (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, op. cit., II, 493-98). Finally, in 514 or 515 was held a council under the presidency of Severus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and of Philoxens, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of Hierapolis, and which assembled the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the provinces of Antioch, Apamaea, Augusta Euphratensis, Osrhoene, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> Libanensis. it rejected the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a> of the Emperor Zeno was explained in a sense clearly opposed to the latter council (Lebon, "Le monophysisme s&eacute;v&eacute;rien", Louvain, 1909, 62-4).

<p><a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christ., II, 801-12) mentions 20 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this see, some of whom have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to figure in the list. Besides those already mentioned were: Paulinus, friend of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, mentioned by Arius in a letter as being one of his partisans (<a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, "H.E.", I, v) and who subsequently became <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, previously a count, a partisan of Nestorius exiled in 449 to <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a>, and who compiled a collection of very valuable documents which have reached us under the title of "Tragaedia Irenaei"; Photius, very active in the religious quarrels of his time, and who assisted at the Councils of Tyre and Chalcedon, as well as at the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Council of Ephesus</a>; John Codonatus, a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> and friend of Peter Fullo, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; Thomas, who at the Eighth Ecumenical Council represented the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.

<p>Included at first in the Province of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the Diocese of Tyre formed part of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, at the creation of that province by <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> shortly before 198, when it became the religious as well as the civil <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>; its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Marinus, had the title of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> as early as 250 (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.5</a>). When between 381 and 425 <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> was subdivided into two provinces, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> Maritima and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> Libanensis, Tyre remained the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the former. At the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 451 Photius had to defend his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Berytus, formerly his suffragan, who divided <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> Prima into two parts and assumed authority over all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of the north. The council recognized the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Photius and gave him <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> with the exception of Berytus, which remained an autocephalous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. Some years later Tyre became the chief see of the Patriarchate of Antioch, i.e. it attained first rank among the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a>. The reason for this was that, about 480, John Codnatus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, having resigned in favour of Calandion, the latter appointed him <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Tyre, with the right for himself and his successors of thenceforth sitting immediately after the patriarch (<a href="../cathen/14623a.htm">Theophanes</a>, "Chronographia"). In the <a href="../cathen/11124b.htm">"Notitia episcopatuum"</a> of Antioch in the sixth century Tyre had 13 suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> (Echos d'Orient, X, 145). In the tenth century the western boundaries of the archdiocese went from the great spring of Zip (Az-Zib) to Nahr-Laitani, the ancient Leontes (Echos d'Orient, X, 97). The Greek archdiocese was retained even during the Latin occupation, but the titular resided at Constantinople.

<p>Odo, the first Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, was appointed in 1122 and died two years later when the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> were besieging the city; his successor, William, was of English origin. In disregard of the ancient canon law, the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> was subjected to the Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which aroused protest on the part of the See of Antioch. The dispute which followed was referred to the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a>, who decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in virtue of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of his predecessor, Paschal II, who granted to King Baldwin the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to subject to Jerusalem all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> he should succeed in conquering from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. Hence two letters of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tyre to submit to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> together with his six suffragans, the Bishops of Tripoli, Tortosa (or Antaradus), <a href="../cathen/03092c.htm">Byblos</a>, Berytus, <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a>, and Ptolemais. Later, when the cities of Tripoli, <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, and Byblos came into the power of the Prince of Antioch, their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also became dependent on the Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. For long lists of Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> see <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christ, III, 1309-20) and Eubel (Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, I, 534; II, 284; III, 342). The most famous was William II, the historian of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>. The Latins evacuated Tyre in 1291 and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> command, having left the city, 8 Oct., 1294, there were thenceforth only titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Archdiocese of Tyre is bounded on the north by Nahr el-Laitani, on the east by a line of wooded hills separating the District of Beharre from that of Merdjaioun, on the south by the Diocese of St.-Jean d'Acre, and on the west by the sea. It has 14 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 13 stations with or without residential <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 16 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 6 are seculars and 10 religious of Saint-Sauveur, 16 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls, half of which are in charge of Latin missionaries and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> sisters. The number of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> is 5300. Besides their mission at Tyre, the American <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the Diocese at Almat and Cana. The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> diocese, founded in 1906 to the detriment of that of Saida, is bounded on the west by the sea, on the north by the River Zaharani, on the east by the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and on the south by the Sinaitic peninsula. It has 10,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 20 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 20 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; the number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is unknown. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Graeco-Arabic Archdiocese of Tyre and Sidon has about 9000 faithful.
