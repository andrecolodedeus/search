<h1>Ubertino of Casale</h1>  

<p>Leader of the Spirituals, born at <a href="../cathen/03396a.htm">Casale of Vercelli</a>, 1259; died about 1330.

<p>He assumed the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the province of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in 1273, and was sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to continue his studies, where he remained nine years, after which he returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1285 he visited the sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and thence proceeded to Greccio, near <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, to see the <a href="../cathen/08475c.htm">Blessed John of Parma</a>, who was considered as the patriarch of the Spiritual Friars. Afterwards he settled in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and in 1287, at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, was the companion and disciple of Brother Pierre-Jean Olivi. He held a lectorship at Santa Croce, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, but abandoned it after a few years to dedicate himself to preaching, especially at Florence. Being a man of genius, but of an eccentric and restless character, he soon became the leader of the famous Spirituals in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, professed strange <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> regarding evangelical and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> poverty, and attacked the government of the order, although some of these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> had been reproved by Olivi in his letter of Sept., 1295, to Blessed Conrado da Offida, a moderate <em>Zelante</em> of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> poverty. The Spirituals of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> were so fanatical as publicly to blame <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, and even to condemn them as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, for having interpreted the Rule of St. Francis as regards poverty according to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and moderation; they also condemned <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, who had strongly disapproved of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Joachim of Flora</a>, whom they regarded as an <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> of the Holy Ghost, and whose theories were the cause of the discord in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> in the first half of the fourteenth century.

<p>On account of his excessive and satirical criticism, Ubertino was summoned before <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> and forbidden to preach at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and was banished to the Convent of La Verna, where in 1305 he conceived and wrote, in only three months and seven days (if he can be believed on this point), his chief work, "Arbor vitae crucifixae Jesu Christi". This work is a collection of allegorical, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, and political theories regarding civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of those days, and expounds also his ideal of the near future. In this work he criticises everything and everyone, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially for pretended abuses of riches in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil states, and finally the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> for not practising the extremest poverty. In the same work, (book I, chap. iv) is the first mention of the legend of the resurrection of St. Francis, as he affirms to have heard from Blessed Conrado da Offida, and the latter from <a href="../cathen/09173a.htm">Blessed Brother Leo</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had raised up St. Francis with a glorious body to console his poor <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, who, according to Ubertino, were of course the Spirituals only. Notwithstanding the Utopian theories of Ubertino, he had many protectors and admirers, and in 1307, after having written the "Arbor vitae", he was chosen <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and familiar to Cardinal Napoleone Orsini, nephew of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, who had been created by <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> protector of the Spirituals of the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Marches of Ancona</a>, but which protectorate soon ceased by the election of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in Dec., 1294. Orsini, who in 1306-08 had been pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, deputed Ubertino on 10 Sept., 1307, to absolve the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, who had incurred <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censure</a>. When Orsini went to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1308, Ubertino did not accompany him, being then called to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In the years 1309-12, which witnessed the greatest struggle in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, Ubertino was called to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> with other chiefs of the Spirituals to discuss before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the questions at issue between the two parties in the order.

<p>Four points were discussed:<ol><li>the relations of the order with the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the so-called Followers of the Free Spirit; <li>the condemnation and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Olivi; <li>the poverty and discipline in the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a>; and <li>the supposed persecutions of the Spirituals of the order.</ol> During the discussions Ubertino behaved in a very boisterous and insolent manner against the whole body of the order, accusing it of many <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> things; however, he was forced to acknowledge that regular discipline substantially existed in the order; but as regards poverty he attacked openly the pontifical declarations as contrary to the rule and as a cause of ruin to the order. He pretended that the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> should be compelled to observe <em>ad litteram</em> St. Francis's Testament and Rule, and even all the evangelical counsels taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And because all this was not possible to obtain from the majority of the order, he exacted that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and provinces should be erected for the reform party. But this was absolutely denied, whilst on the other hand the question of practical observance of poverty was settled by the famous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Exivi de paradiso", 6 May, 1312, partly called forth by the polemical writings of Ubertino.

<p>Ubertino thereon retired to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1313, and stayed with Cardinal Giacomo Colonna till he had obtained from <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1 Oct., 1317) permission to leave the order and to enter the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Gembloux, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Diocese of Li&egrave;ge</a>. Some have <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> would have received in their community a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of such a restless character, but we are assured of it by Clareno and a notary of King James II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> in the year 1318. Notwithstanding this, Ubertino did not desist from mixing himself up in the question that troubled the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> till he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>. While still a favourite of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and a familiar of Cardinal Orsini, he was invited by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> to give his opinion regarding the other famous question discussed between the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, that is, concerning the poverty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and that of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. This latter question, far more than the one concerning the Spirituals, caused the disastrous <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the order headed by <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, general of the order, and seconded by the rebellious Louis IV of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Ubertino was at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1322; on the request of the Pope he wrote his answer to the question then in controversy, asserting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles have to be considered in a two-fold condition: as private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> they had repudiated all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion they made use of goods and money for necessaries and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> was satisfied with the answer, but Ubertino returned again to the service of Cardinal Orsini, and continued his writings to concern himself in the question, which meanwhile had been settled, 1322-23. However this may be, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in 1325 he was accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, especially of having obstinately sustained some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Olivi.

<p>Ubertino, foreseeing the condemnation that hung over him, fled from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 Sept., 1325, commanded the general of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to have him arrested as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; but Ubertino probably went to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> under the protection of Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, whom he is said to have accompanied on his way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1328. From this time Ubertino disappeared from history, so that nothing more is known of him. Some suppose that he left the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> in 1332 to join the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, but this is not certain. The Fraticelli of the fifteenth century, who <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> him as a saintly man, spread the news that he had been killed. The end of this famous leader of the Spirituals, remembered by even <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> in the twelfth canto of the "Paradise", will probably remain an obscure point in history.

<p>Besides the "Arbor vitae", his principal work, printed once only at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1485, and of which scarcely thirteen <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are known in the principal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, Ubertino also wrote other works of a polemical kind: <ul><li>the "Responsio" to the questions of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1310); <li>the "Rotulus" (1311); <li>the "Declaratio" against the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> (1311); <li>the apology of Olivi "Sanctitati Apostolicae", and <li>the treatise "Super tribus sceleribus" on poverty, compiled also in 1311.</ul>
