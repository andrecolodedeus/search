<h1>Ubiquitarians</h1>  

<p>Also called <em>Ubiquists</em>, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> started at the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> of Stuttgart, 19 December, 1559, by John Brenz, a Swabian (1499-1570). Its profession, made under the name of Duke Christopher of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, and entitled the "W&uuml;rtemberg Confession," was sent to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, in 1552, but had not been formally accepted as the Ubiquitarian creed until the synod at Stuttgart. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had upset the peace of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by his disputes. In the effort to reconcile and unite the contending forces against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> demanded of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> a written statement of their doctrines. This &#151; the "Augsburg Confession" &#151; was composed by <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, and read at a meeting at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1530. Its tenth article concerned the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament</a>, a burning question among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. In 1540, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> published another version of the "Augsburg Confession", in which the article on the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> differed essentially from what had been expressed in 1530. The wording was as follows:<ul><li><em>Edition of 1530:</em> "Concerning the Lord's Supper, they teach that the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are truly present, and are distributed (communicated) to those that eat in the Lord's Supper; and they disapprove of those that teach otherwise." <li><em>Edition of 1540:</em> "Concerning the Lord's Supper, they teach that with <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> are truly exhibited the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to those that eat in the Lord's Supper."</ul>

<p><a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Johann Eck</a> was the first to call attention to the change, in a conference at Worms, 1541. Debates followed, and the Ubiquitarian controversy arose, the question being: Is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the Eucharist, and if so, why? The Confession of 1540 was known as the Reformed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. To this <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, with his adherents, subscribed, and maintained that <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Christ's body</a> was not in the Eucharist. For, the Eucharist was everywhere, and it was impossible, they contended, for a body to be in many places simultaneously. Adopting <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/04169a.htm"><em>communicatio idiomatum</em></a>, Brenz argued that the attributes of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> had been communicated to the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which thus was deified. If deified, it was everywhere, ubiquitous, just as His divinity, and therefore <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a> in the Eucharist. Brenz was in harmony with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> as to the fact, but not as to the explanation. His assertion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had been deified, and that His body was in the Eucharist as it was elsewhere, was <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is everywhere, but His body and blood, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and divinity, are in the Eucharist in a different, special manner (<em>sacramentally</em>). In 1583, Chemnitz, who had unconsciously been defending the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, calmed the discussion by his adhesion to absolute Ubiquitarianism. In 1616 the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> arose again as Kenoticism and Crypticism, but sank into oblivion in the troubles of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>.
