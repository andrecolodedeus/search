<h1>Uccello</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">Painter</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1397; died there, 1475. His real name was Paolo di Dono, but from his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> birds he received the nickname of <em>Uccello</em>, and has been most frequently called by that name ever since. He was apprenticed to <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a>, and was one of the assistants engaged in preparing the first pair of bronze gates made for the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> tells us that his special <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was for geometry and perspective. Manetti taught him geometry, but where he learned <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, nor are we acquainted with the reasons which led him to leave the <em>botega</em> of <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a> and set up for himself. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> scoffs at Uccello's study of perspective, regarding it as waste of time, and saying that the artist became "more needy than famous". His skill in foreshortening and proportion, and in some of the complex difficulties of perspective, was quite remarkable, and his pictures for this reason alone are well worth careful study, for they display an extraordinary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of geometric perspective. His most important work is the colossal equestrian figure of Sir John Hawkwood, a chiaroscuro in <em>terraverde</em>, intended to imitate a stone <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, seen aloft, standing out from the wall of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. One of the most precious possessions of the National Gallery, London, is a battle-picture by this artist. For a long time this was wrongly entitled the "Battle of Sant' Egidio of 1416", but it really represents the rout of San Romano of 1432. Instead of <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a>, the picture gives us a representation of <a href="../cathen/11065a.htm">Nicol&ograve; da Tolentino</a>. Mr. Herbert Horne gave considerable attention to the history of this picture some twelve years ago, and was able to arrive at a very accurate determination regarding it. There are very few <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Uccello in existence, although he must have <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a considerable number. There is a panel by him in the Louvre, containing his own portrait, associated with those of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>, <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>, <a href="../cathen/03008c.htm">Brunelleschi</a>, and Manetti, representing perspective associated with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, architecture, and geometry. Many of the frescoes he executed for Santa Maria Novella have been destroyed. The only other picture of his that need be mentioned here is a predella in a church near <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, relating to the theft of a pax, which is attributed to him by many critics. He is said to have studied the works of Pisanello with great advantage, and it is probable that it was from Pisanello that he first learned <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, but he may be practically regarded as one of the founders of the art of linear perspective. There are very few dates known in his history beyond those of his birth and death. But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in 1425 he was at work at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in 1436 <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> his portrait of Sir John Hawkwood, and in 1468 residing at <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>.
