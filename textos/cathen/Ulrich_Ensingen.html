<h1>Ulrich Ensingen</h1>  

<p>(ULRICH ENSINGER)

<p>Belonged to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of architects who came from Einsingen near Ulm, Wurtemberg, and who shared as master-builders in the construction of the most important Gothic buildings of the fifteenth century in Southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Ulrich, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, is known from the year 1391; d. at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 10 Feb., 1419. Apparently he learned his craft in the stonemason's guild of Ulm, and was also, perhaps, a pupil of Master Heinrich the Younger of Ulm. In 1391 he was asked to take charge of the work on the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but he seems at that time to have stayed in Ulm, where he was architect of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> until his death. At first his engagement at Ulm was for five years only, but in 1397 he was appointed master architect for life. Ulrich completed the choir, began the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, and made the ground-plan of the tower. In 1394-95 he worked on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but, disagreeing with the Duke of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> as to questions of artistic detail, he went back to Ulm. His connexion with the work on the Strasburg <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, however, lasted longer; at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> he was master-builder during 1399-1419 and built the north tower from the platform to the great window. At the same time he completed the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and the lower part of the tower of the church of Our Lady at Esslingen. Besides two daughters Ulrich had three sons; his sons all followed the calling of their father. At first they used Ulrich's official title <em>Kirchenmeister</em> as a family name, but later adopted that of Ensingen (Ensinger).

<p>(2) CASPAR ENSINGEN was the oldest son; very little is known of him.

<p>(3) MATTHIAS ENSINGEN, another son, d. 1438. There is evidence that he was employed on the Ulm <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> from 1427 and at Esslingen during 1436-38.

<p>(4) MATTH&Auml;US ENSINGEN, the youngest and most gifted son, can be traced during the years 1420-1463. In 1420 he worked at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>; in the same year he was appointed master-builder for the work on the minster at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>. The cornerstone of this was laid in 1421 and Matth&auml;us conducted the work until 1449. In addition he had his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> position as architect at Esslingen (1419-1463). It can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he was engaged on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Ulm from 1446, but it was not until 1451 that he had charge of its construction as master-builder; before this last appointment he worked (1449-51) on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> without occupying any well-defined position. On the Ulm <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> he completed the vaulting of the choir and built the tower as high as the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. During his last years he was for a short time again at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>.

<p>(5) VINCENZ ENSINGEN, son of Matth&auml;us, employed at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> from 1448; during 1462-85 he worked at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and in 1472 he built the small <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> at Basle.
