<h1>Ultramontanism</h1>  

<p>A term used to denote integral and active <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, because it recognizes as its spiritual head the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who, for the greater part of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, is a dweller beyond the mountains (<em>ultra montes</em>), that is, beyond the Alps. The term "ultramontane", indeed, is relative: from the Roman, or Italian, point of view, the French, the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, and all the other peoples north of the Alps are ultramontanes, and technical <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language actually applies the word in precisely this sense. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, when a non-Italian <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was elected he was said to be a <em>papa ultramontano</em>. In this sense the word occurs very frequently in documents of the thirteenth century; after the migration to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, however, it dropped out of the language of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>.

<p>In a very different sense, the word once more came into use after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>, which was, among other things, a triumph of that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> particularism, based on political principles, which was formulated in the maxim: <em>Cujus regio, ejus religio</em>. Among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> governments and peoples there gradually developed an analogous tendency to regard the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as a foreign power; Gallicanism and all forms of French and German regalism affected to look upon the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as an alien power because it was beyond the Alpine boundaries of both the French kingdom and the German empire. This name of Ultramontane the Gallicans applied to the supporters of the Roman doctrines--whether that of the monarchical character of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> pontifical <em>magisterium</em>--inasmuch as the latter were supposed to renounce "Gallican liberties" in favour of the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who resided <em>ultra montes</em>. This use of the word was not altogether novel; as early as the time of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> the opponents of Henry IV in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> had been called Ultramontanes (<em>ultramontani</em>). In both cases the term was intended to be opprobrious, or at least to convey the imputation of a failing in attachment to the Ultramontane's own prince, or his country, or his national Church.

<p>In the eighteenth century the word passed from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> back to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where it was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronians</a>, Josephinists, and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a>, who called themselves <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, to designate the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and the faithful who were attached to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Thus it acquired a much wider signification, being applicable to all <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholics</a> worthy of the name. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> adopted this polemical term from the old regime: the "Divine State", formerly personified in the prince, now found its personification in the people, becoming more "Divine" than ever as the State became more and more laic and irreligious, and, both in principle and in fact, denied any other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but itself. In presence of this new form of the old state-worship, the "Ultramontane" is the antagonist of the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a> as much as the non-Catholic believers, if not more--witness the Bismarckian <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>, of which the National <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> rather than the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Thus the word came to be applied more especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> from the earliest decades of the nineteenth century. In the frequent conflicts between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> the supporters of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> liberty and independence as against the State are called Ultramontanes. The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> naturally called forth numerous written attacks upon Ultramontanism. When the Centre was formed as a political party it was called by preference the Ultramontane party. In a few years the "Anti-Ultramontane Reichsverband" came into existence to combat the Centre and, at the same time, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> as a whole.

<p>As our present purpose is to state what Ultramontanism is, it is beside our scope to expound the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and, in particular, of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whether in spiritual or temporal matters, these subjects being treated elsewhere under their respective titles. It is sufficient here to indicate what our adversaries mean by Ultramontanism. For <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> it would be superfluous to ask whether Ultramontanism and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> are the same thing: assuredly, those who combat Ultramontanis are in fact combating <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, even when they disclaim the desire to oppose it. One of the recent adversaries of Ultramontanism among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Professor Franz Xaver Kraus, who says ("Spektatorbrief", II, quoted in the article <em>Ultramontanismus</em> in "Realencycl. f&uuml;r prot. Theol. u. Kirche", ed. 1908): "1. An Ultramontane is one who sets the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> above that of religion; 2. ...who substitutes the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; 3. ...who believes that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is of this world and that, as <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> curialism asserted, the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, given to Peter, included temporal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> also; 4. ...who believes that religious conviction can be imposed or broken with material force; 5. ...who is ever ready to sacrifice to an extraneous authority the plain teaching of his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>." According to the definition given in Leichtenberger, "Encycl. des sciences religieuses" (ed. 1882): "The character of Ultramontanism is manifested chiefly in the ardour with which it combats every movement of independence in the national Churches, the condemnation which it visits upon works written to defend that independence, its denial of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State in matters of government, of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control, the tenacity with which it has prosecuted the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">pope's infallibility</a> and with which it incessantly advocates the restoration of his temporal power as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> guarantee of his spiritual sovereignty."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Ultramontanism is accounted for not merely by its adversaries' denial of the genuine <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> power and that of her supreme ruler, but also, and even more, by the consequences of that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. It is altogether <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to attribute to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> either political aims of temporal dominion among the nations or the pretence that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> can at his own pleasure depose sovereigns that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> must, even in purely civil matters, subordinate his obedience towards his own sovereign to that which he owes to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fatherland of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and so forth. These are either pure inventions or malicious travesties. It is neither scientific nor honest to attribute to "Ultramontanism" the particular teaching of some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> or some <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of times past; or to invoke certain facts in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> history, which may be explained by the peculiar conditions, or by the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> possessed in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (for example, their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in conferring the imperial crown). For the rest, it is sufficient to follow attentively, one by one, the struggle kept up in their journals and books to be convinced that this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalist</a>-Protestant-Modernist coalition against "Clericalism" or "Ultramontanism" is, fundamentally, directed against integral <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>--that is, against <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a>, anti-Liberal, and counter-Revolutionary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. (See also <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">STATE AND CHURCH</a>; <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">FEBRONIANISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/14368b.htm">SYLLABUS</a>.)
