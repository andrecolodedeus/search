<h1>Unam Sanctam</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>the One Holy</em>, i.e. Church), the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> on <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy issued 18 November, 1302, by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> during the dispute with <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It is named from its opening words (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">BONIFACE VIII</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in connection with the Roman Council of October, 1302, at which it had probably been discussed. it is not impossible that <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> himself revised the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>; still it also appears that Aegidius Colonna, Archibishop of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, who had come to the council at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> notwithstanding the royal prohibition, influenced the text. The original of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> is no longer in existence; the oldest text is to be found in the registers of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in the Vatican archives ["Reg. Vatic.", L, fol. 387]. It was also incorporated in the "Corpus juris canonici" ("Extravag. Comm.", I, vii, 1; ed. Friedberg, II, 1245). The genuineness of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> is absolutely established by the entry of it in the official registers of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Briefs</a>, and its incorporation in the canon law. The objections to its genuineness raised by such scholars as <a href="../cathen/04614b.htm">Damberger</a>, Mury, and Verlaque are fully removed by this external testimony. At a later date Mury withdrew his opinion.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> lays down dogmatic propositions on the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, the necessity of belonging to it for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the position of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as supreme head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> thence arising of submission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in order to belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and thus to attain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> further emphasizes the higher position of the spiritual in comparison with the secular order. From these premises he then draws conclusions concerning the relation between the spiritual power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>. The main propositions of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> are the following: First, the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> and its necessity for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are declared and established by various passages from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and by reference to the one <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">Ark of the Flood</a>, and to the seamless garment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then affirms that, as the unity of the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so is the unity of its head established in Peter and his successors. Consequently, all who wish to belong to the fold of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are placed under the dominion of Peter and his successors. When, therefore, the Greeks and others say they are not subject to the authority of Peter and his successors, they thus acknowledge that they do not belong to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">Christ's sheep</a>.

<p>Then follow some principles and conclusions concerning the spiritual and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>:<ul> <li>Under the control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are two swords, that is two powers, the expression referring to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> theory of the two swords, the spiritual and the secular. This is substantiated by the customary reference to the swords of the Apostles at the arrest of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs38">Luke 22:38</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs52">Matthew 26:52</a>). <li>Both swords are in the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the spiritual is wielded in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the hand of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the secular is to be employed for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the hand of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, but under the direction of the spiritual power. <li>The one sword must be subordinate to the other: the earthly power must submit to the spiritual authority, as this has precedence of the secular on account of its greatness and sublimity; for the spiritual power has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to establish and guide the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, and also to judge it when it does not act rightly. When, however, the earthly power goes astray, it is judged by the spiritual power; a lower spiritual power is judged by a higher, the highest spiritual power is judged by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <li>This authority, although granted to man, and exercised by man, is not a human authority, but rather a Divine one, granted to Peter by Divine commission and confirmed in him and his successors. Consequently, whoever opposes this power <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> opposes the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a> and seems, like a <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a>, to accept two principles.</ul> "Now, therefore, we declare, say, determine and pronounce that for every human creature it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to be subject to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>" (Porro subesse Romano Pontifici omni humanae creaturae declaramus, dicimus, definimus, et pronuntiamus omnino esse de necessitate salutis).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> is universal in character. As its content shows, a careful distinction is made between the fundamental principles concerning the Roman primacy and the declarations as to the application of these to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> and its representatives. In the registers, on the margin of the text of the record, the last sentence is noted as its real definition: "Declaratio quod subesse Romano Pontifici est omni humanae creaturae de necessitate salutis" (It is here stated that for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that every human creature be subject to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>). This definition, the meaning and importance of which are clearly evident from the connection with the first part on the necessity of the one Church for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as the one supreme head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, expresses the necessity for everyone who wishes to attain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and therefore of being subject to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in all religious matters. This has been the constant teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and it was declared in the same sense by the Fifth Ecumenical Council of the Lateran, in 1516: "De necessitate esse salutis omnes Christi fideles Romano Pontifici subesse" (That it is of the necessity of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">Christ's faithful</a> to be subject to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>). The translation by Berchtold of the expression <em>humanae creaturae</em> by "temporal authorities" is absolutely wrong. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> also proclaims the subjection of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> to the spiritual as the one higher in rank, and draws from it the conclusion that the representatives of the spiritual power can install the possessors of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a> and exercise judgment over their administration, should it be contrary to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> law.

<p>This is a fundamental principle which had grown out of the entire development in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> of the central position of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian national family</a> of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It had been expressed from the eleventh century by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> like <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard of Clairvaux</a> and <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> like <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> and <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>. <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> gave it precise expression in opposing the procedure of the French king. The main propositions are drawn from the writings of St. Bernard, <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, and letters of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Both from these authorities and from declarations made by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> himself, it is also evident that the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the spiritual power over the secular has for its basis the concept of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as guardian of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> law of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, hence her <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extends as far as this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is concerned. Consequently, when King Philip protested, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> was able, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Meruit", of 1 February, 1306, to declare that the French king and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were to suffer no disadvantage on account of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Unam Sanctam", and that the issuing of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> had not made them subject to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in any other manner than formerly. In this way, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> was able to give <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and its ruler a guarantee of security from the ecclesiastico-political results of the opinions elaborated in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, while its dogmatic decision suffered no detriment of any kind. In the struggles of the Gallican party against the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, and also in the writings of non-Catholic authors against the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Unam Sanctam" was used against <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> as well as against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy in a manner not justified by its content. The statements concerning the relations between the spiritual and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> are of a purely historical character, so far as they do not refer to the nature of the spiritual power, and are based on the actual conditions of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.
