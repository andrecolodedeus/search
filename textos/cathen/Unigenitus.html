<h1>Unigenitus</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, condemning 101 propositions of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Pasquier Quesnel</a>. In 1671 <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> had published a book entitled "Abr&eacute;g&eacute; de la morale de l'Evangile". It contained the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> in French, with short notes explanatory of the text, at the same time serving as aids for meditation. The work was approved by Bishop Vialart of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>. An enlarged edition, containing an annotated French text of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, appeared in three small volumes in 1678, and a later edition in four volumes appeared under the title "Le nouveau testament en francais avec dees reflexions morales sur chaque verse, pour en rendre la lecture plus utile et la m&eacute;ditation plus ais&eacute;e" (Paris, 1693-94). This last edition was highly recommended by Noailles, who had succeeded Vialart as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>. While the first edition of the work contained only a few <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, its <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> tendency became more apparent in the second edition, and in its complete form, as it appeared in 1693, it was pervaded with practically all the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> forbade its reading in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> condemned it in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, "Universi Dominici Gregis", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 July, 1708. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> was, however, not accepted in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> because its wording and its manner of publication were not in harmony with the "Gallican Liberties". <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a>, who had become <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, was too proud to withdraw the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> which he had inadvertently given to the book while <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> again raised its head. To put an end to this situation several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and especially <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, asked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to issue a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in place of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> which the French Government did not accept. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was to avoid every expression contrary to the "Gallican Liberties" and to be submitted to the French Government before publication. To avoid further <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> yielded to these humiliating conditions, and in Feb., 1712, appointed a special congregation of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to cull from the work of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> such propositions as were deserving of <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censure</a>. The most influential member of this congregation was Cardinal Fabroni.

<p>It took the congregation eighteen months to perform its task, the result of which was the publication of the famous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Unigenitus Dei Filius" at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 8 Sept., 1713. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> begins with the warning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> against <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, especially such as "secretly spread <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrines under the guise of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and introduce ruinous <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> under the image of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>"; then it proceeds to the condemnation of 101 propositions which are taken verbatim from the last edition of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel's</a> work. The propositions are condemned respectively as "False, captious, ill-sounding, offensive to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ears, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a>, pernicious, rash, injurious to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its practices, contumelious to <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, seditious, impious, blasphemous, suspected and savouring of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, favouring <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, bordering on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, often condemned, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and reviving various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, especially those contained in the famous propositions of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>". The first forty-three propositions repeat the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> on grace and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, such as: grace works with <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> and is irresistible; without grace man can only commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> only. The succeeding twenty-eight propositions (44-71) concern <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity: every <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that is not <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; without <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> there can be no hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no obedience to His law, no good work, no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, no merit, no religion; the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the sinner and his other good acts performed out of fear of punishment are only new <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The last thirty propositions (72-101) deal with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, its discipline, and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> comprises only the just and the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>; the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is binding on all; sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> should be postponed till after satisfaction; the chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> can exercise the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> power of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> only with the consent, at least presumed, of the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> does not exclude the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> from union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Besides condemning these 101 propositions, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> states that it finds fault with many other statements in the book of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, without, however, specifying them, and, in particular, with the translation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which, as the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> reads, has been censurably altered (<em>damnabiliter vitiatum</em>) and is in many ways similar to the previously condemned French version of Mons.

<p><a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> received the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> at Fontainebleau on 24 Sept., 1713, and sent a copy to Cardinal Noailles, who, probably before receiving it, had revoked, on 28 Sept., his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the "Moral Reflections" given in 1695. The king also ordered the assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to convene at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on 16 Oct., and designated the acceptation of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> as the purpose of the meeting. At the first session, on 16 Oct., <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> appointed a committee presided over by Cardinal Rohan of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> to decide upon the most suitable manner of accepting the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Noailles, who took part in a few sessions of the committee, attempted to prevent an unconditional acceptation of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> by the committee, and when his efforts <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fruitless he would have withdrawn from the assembly if the king had not ordered him to remain. The report of the committee was for an unqualified acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, and at the session of the assembly on 22 Jan., 1714, the report was accepted by a vote of forty against nine. By order of the king, the bull was registered by the Parliament on 15 Feb. and by the Sorbonne on 5 March. A pastoral instruction of <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a>, forbidding his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> under pain of suspension to accept the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> without his authorization, was condemned by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> not present at the assembly, seven joined the opposition, while the remaining seventy-two accepted the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> unconditionally. The opposition, with the exception of Bishop de la Brou of Mirepoix, also condemned the book of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>. As a pretext of their non-acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, they gave out that it was obscure. Ostensibly they postponed their acceptance only until the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would explain its obscurity by special declarations. It is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could not yield to these demands without imperilling the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>.



<p>It was the intention of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> to summon <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> before the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and, if needs be, despoil him of the purple. But the king and his councillors, seeing in this mode of procedure a trespass upon the "Gallican Liberties", proposed the convocation of a national council which should judge and pass sentence upon <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> and his faction. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not relish the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of convoking a national council which might unnecessarily protract the quarrel and endanger the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. He, however, drew up two Briefs, the one demanding the unconditional acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> by <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> within fifteen days, on pain of losing the purple and incurring canonical punishment, the other paternally pointing out the gravity of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> offence and exhorting him to go hand in hand with the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in opposing the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Both Briefs were put in the hand of the king, with the request to deliver the less severe in case there was well-founded hope of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> speedy submission, but the more severe if he continued in his obstinacy. On the one hand, <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> gave no hope of submission, while, on the other, the more severe of the Briefs was rejected by the king as subversive of the "Gallican Liberties". <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, therefore, again pressed the convocation of a national council but died (1 Sept., 1715) before it could be convened. He was succeeded as regent by Duke Philip of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, who favoured the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. The Sorbonne passed a resolution, 4 Jan., 1716, annulling its previous registration of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, and twenty-two Sorbonnists who protested were removed from the faculty on 5 Feb. The Universities of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> now also rejected the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the former on 2 Jan., the latter on 26 June. In consequence <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> withdrew from the Sorbonne all the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> privileges which it possessed and deprived it of the power of conferring academic degrees on 18 Nov. He had sent two Briefs to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on 1 May. One, addressed to the regent, severely reproved him for favouring the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>; the other, addressed to the opposition, threatened to deprive <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> of the purple, and to proceed canonically against all that would not accept the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> within two months. These Briefs were not accepted by the regent because their text had not been previously submitted to his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. But he sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Chevalier, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Meaux whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not, however, admit to his presence, when it became known that his sole purpose was to wrest the admission from <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was obscure and required an explanation. In a consistory held on 27 June, 1716, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> delivered a passionate allocution, lasting three hours, in which he informed the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the treatment which the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> had received in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and expressed his purpose of divesting <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. The following November he sent two new Briefs to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, one to the regent, whose co-operation he asked in suppressing the opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>; the other to the <a href="../cathen/01094c.htm">acceptants</a>, whom he warned against the intrigues of the recalcitrants, and requested to exhort their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> brethren to give up their resistance.

<p>On 1 March, 1717, four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Soanen of Senez, <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm#III">Colbert of Montpellier</a>, Delangle of Boulogne, and de La Broue of Mirepoix) drew up an appeal from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, thus founding the party hereafter known as the "appellants". They were joined by the faculties of the Sorbonne on 5 March, of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> on 8 March, and of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> on 10 March; likewise by the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> on 22 March, of <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a> on 12 April, of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, Condom, <a href="../cathen/01209b.htm">Agen</a>, and St. Malo on 21 April, of Auxerre on 14 May, and more than a year later by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon, also by the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a> and <a href="../cathen/01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a>. Though a personal letter of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 25 March, and a joint letter of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> urgently begged <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> to submit, he also drew up an appeal on 3 April, "from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> manifestly mistaken, and from the Constitution Unigenitus, in virtue of the decrees of the Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and Basle, to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> better informed and to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to be held without constraint and in a safe place". He did not, however, publish his appeal for the present, but deposited it in the archives of the <em>officialit&eacute;</em> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On 6 May he wrote a long letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in which he endeavours to justify his position and that of his adherents. A few months later his appeal from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was published. The appellants were soon joined by many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious, especially from the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. To swell the list of appellants the names of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were accepted. The number of appellants is said to have reached 1800 to 2000, pitifully small, if we consider that about 1,500,000 livres ($300,000) were spent by them as bribes.

<p>On 8 March, 1718, appeared a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, approved by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, which condemned the appeal of the four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and that of <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> as <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> and approaching to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Since they did not withdraw their appeal within a reasonable time, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Pastoralis officii" on 28 Aug., 1718, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> all that refused to accept the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Unigenitus". But they appealed also from this second <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> finally made an ambiguous submission on 13 March, 1720, by signing an explanation of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Unigenitus", drawn up by order of the French secretary of State, Abb&eacute; Dubois, and, later, approved by ninety-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. After much pressure from the king and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> he made public this ambiguous acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in his pastoral instruction of 18 Nov., 1720. But this did not satisfy <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, who required an unconditional acceptance. After the death of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, 19 March, 1721, the appellants continued in their obstinancy during the pontificates of <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a> (1721-24) and <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1724-30). <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the opposition, finally made a sincere and unconditional submission on 11 Oct., 1728, and died soon after (2 May, 1729). The <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, in concerted action with the new Archbishop Vintimille of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the French Government, gradually brought about the submission of most of the appellants.
