<h1>Union of Brest</h1>  

<p>Brest &#151; in Russian, Brest-Litovski; in Polish, Brzesc; in the old chronicles, called Brestii, or Brestov.

<p>Brest is a city in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, with some 50,000 inhabitants, famous in the history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> for the union of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>.

<p>After the annexation of Red Ruthenia, or the Ukraine, to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, in 1569, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, who had become politically subject to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, began to compare the lamentable condition of their Church with the development and vitality of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and to turn their eyes towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were steeped in immorality and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> made no scruple of setting their flocks an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> example, living in open <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, and practising the most brazen <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Russian documents of the sixteenth century bear witness to this melancholy decay of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> in the Polish provinces and to the impossibility of applying any remedy. Face to face with this spiritual ruin, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, reinvigorated by the accession of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, was showing her immense religious and moral superiority. Some loyal and honourable members of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> gradually became convinced that only a return to the Roman obedience could secure for their Church anything like sound conditions.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who had been established at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a> in 1569, at Yaroslaff in 1574, and successively at Polotsk, Grodno, and other cities of Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, soon set about to conciliate the friends of union among the Orthodox and to second their efforts. They began publishing works of religious controversy, emphasizing the spiritual, moral, and political advantages which must accrue to the so-called <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> from union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Eminent in this labour of preparing opinion for return to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> were <a href="../cathen/14034a.htm">Father Peter Skarga</a> (1536-1612), one of the greatest apostles, and a literary and political genius, of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and Father Benedict Herbest (1531-93). The former published, at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, in 1577, his famous work on "The Unity of God's Church under One Only Pastor" (O jednosci kosciola bozego pod jednym pasterzem), and it filled the Orthodox with confusion; they burned numerous copies of it, so that a new edition had to be published in 1590. Father Herbest then published, also in Polish, his "Exposition of the Faith of the Roman Church, and History of the Greek Servitude" (Cracow, 1586). These two works helped greatly to dispel the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> of the Orthodox friends of union and bring them still nearer to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; a result that was greatly furthered by the writings and labours of <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Antonius Possevinus</a>. However, the Orthodox remained still undecided. Jeremias II, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, visited <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in 1588 and in 1599 arrived at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, where he convoked a synod to find remedies for the most serious evils of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church. Received by Sigismund III, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1587-1632), with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and costly gifts, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Michael Rahosa, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff and Halicz (1588-99). Finding that some of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> did not conceal their desire for reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Jeremias II, to bind them more closely to his own authority and the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 6 August, 1589, appointed Cyril Terlecki, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Kieff. The patriarch also imposed a precept that a synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> must be held every year to remedy the disorders of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church.

<p>In 1590 the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Rahosa, convoked a synod at Brest for 24 June. A few days before the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled, Terlecki had a conference at Bels with the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> (Balaban), Pinsk (Pelczycki), and <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a> (Zbiruiski), and they jointly drew up a document undertaking to "submit their will and their intelligence to the Pope of Rome", and begging that their rites and their <a href="../cathen/12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a> should be preserved. This document was presented to the Synod of Brest, at which the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vladimir assisted; it was accepted and approved, but kept secret, for reasons of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Terlecki was charged to present it to Sigismund III and obtain the royal sanction for it, but a year and more passed before he fulfilled his charge. Sigismund III, having at last received the document, replied to it on 18 March, 1592, expressing his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at the decision of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate, promising them his assistance against possible persecutions by the Orthodox, and assuring them that the national rite should be respected and safeguarded. Nevertheless, the proposal of union, though warmly approved by Terlecki, did not attain realization. Terlecki was soon supported by Adam Pociej, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vladimir in 1593, in succession to Meletius Chrebtowicz, deceased. Pociej was a sincerely convinced advocate of the union, though he well understood the obstacles to its accomplishment. Another synod of <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met at Brest on 24 June, 1593, but avoided the question of union, and confined itself to depriving Gideon Balaban of the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Balaban refused to recognize the privilege granted to the Orthodox patriarchal community of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> by Jeremias II.



<p>On 24 June, 1594, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> again assembled at Brest, but their meeting had no synodal character, as Sigismund III was in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, and no synod could be held in the absence of the sovereign. A few days later, Bishops Terlecki, Balaban, Zbirujski, and Kopystenski met at Sokal and reaffirmed their adhesion to the act of union drawn up at Bels and approved at Brest, in 1590. Terlecki had full powers to treat of the union with the Court of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. They composed a "Decree on receiving back and entering into the communion of the Holy Roman Church" (Decretum de recipienda et suscipienda communione sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae), in which, after deploring the evils resulting from the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, they begged to submit themselves to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">visible pastor</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">God's Church</a>, on condition that the sacred rites and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> customs of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> were preserved, saving such points as might be judged contrary to the union and prejudicial to the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Terlecki began to solicit the adhesion of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to this document, which was <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 2 December, 1594. It was subscribed by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Rahosa, Pociej, Terlecki, Zbirujski, Pelczyski, Gregory of Polotsk, and Jonas Hohol of Pinsk.

<p>On 12 June, 1595, Rahosa, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and the Bishops of Vladimir, <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, and Pinsk met at Brest and drew up two petitions, one to <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and the other to Sigismund III. The former protested that they desired to renew the union concluded at the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, saving always the Eastern customs and rites; in the latter the same desires were expressed, and it was added that the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church adopted the Gregorian Calendar. Pociej and Terlecki betook themselves to Cracow to confer with the king's delegates and the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> as to the basis and conditions of the union. These conditions were accepted. On 2 Aug., 1595, Sigismund III declared that the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> enjoyed the same privileges and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as the Latin, that they were free of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunications</a> and censures inflicted by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, that <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> sees should be entrusted only to <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church should retain the free possession of its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, that <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> could not be latinized, and that the Eastern <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were thenceforward to have no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> agreed to the concession of these privileges, and Sigismund III required that delegates of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate should go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the definitive sanction of the act of union. But its conclusion was already known, and the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a>, Przemysl, and Lemberg announced it to their flocks in pastoral letters <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 August. Unfortunately, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Rahosa, did not act loyally: after signing the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of union, he endeavoured secretly to hinder its execution, and instigated Constantine, Prince of Ostrog, to assemble the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and dissuade them from submitting to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. But Rahosa's intrigues were to no purpose, and, on 25 November, 1595, Pociej and Terlecki arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of union of 2 December, 1594.

<p>The arrival of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> overwhelmed <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and the Roman Court with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The delegates were received with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> discussed the conditions of reunion proposed by the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate, and ungrudgingly conceded that the integrity of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Rite should be maintained; it was also agreed that the "Filioque" should not be inserted in the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> professed and taught the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> asked to be dispensed from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of introducing the Gregorian Calendar, so as to avoid popular discontent and dissensions, and insisted that the king should grant them, as of right, the dignity of senators. To all these requests <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> acceded.

<p>All obstacles having been removed, the union of the Rutheians with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> and publicly proclaimed in the Hall of Constantine in the Vatican. Canon Wollowicz, of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, read in <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> and Latin the letter of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 June, 1595. Cardinal Silvio Antoniani thanked the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and expressed his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> event. Then Pociej, in his own name and that of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate, read in Latin the formula of <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of the Greek Schism, Terlecki read it in <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, and they affixed their signatures. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> then addressed to them an allocution, expressing his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and promising the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> his support. A medal was struck to commemorate the event, with the inscription: "Ruthenis receptis". On the same day the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Magnus Dominus et laudabilis" was published, announcing to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world the return of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> recites the events which led to the union, the arrival of Pociej and Terlecki at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, their <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a>, and the concession to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> that they should retain their own rite, saving such customs as were opposed to the purity of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and incompatible with the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. On 7 Feb., 1596, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Benedictus sit Pastor ille bonus", enjoining the convocation of a synod in which the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to recite the profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Various letters were also sent to the Polish king, princes, and magnates exhorting them to receive the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> under their protection. Another <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Decet romanum pontificem", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 23 Feb., 1596, defined the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate and their relations in subjection to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>About the beginning of February, 1596, Terlecki and Pociej returned to their own country, arriving at <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a> in March and celebrating a solemn "Te Deum" for the success of their mission. But the enemies of the union, their religious fanaticism aroused, redoubled their activity. At the Diet of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, which opened in May, 1596, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> deputies, led by the Prince of Ostrog, protested against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had signed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of union and declared that they would not accept it. The Orthodox communities of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a> and Lemberg stirred up the people against the unionist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. To cut this religious agitation short, Sigismund III ordered the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate to be convoked in a synod at Brest, 8 October, 1596, and the union to be solemnly proclaimed. About 6 October the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Rahosa, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Bishops of Vladimir, <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, Polotsk, Pinsk, <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a>, the Latin Bishops of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a>, <a href="../cathen/14034a.htm">Father Skarga</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> met at Brest. The Orthodox had sent many of their lay representatives, various <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, Nicephorus, the protosyncellus of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and Cyril Lucaris, representing the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. The Orthodox, under the Prince of Ostrog, petitioned for the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had withdrawn from the obedience of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, for the maintenance of the Old Calendar, and for the abrogation of the act of union. They moreover held a conciliabulum to concert measures of opposition. In vain did the king's commissioners labour to allay their hostility and induce them to accept the union; they would not yield, and they refused to recognize Rahosa as their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>.

<p>All attempts failing to win over this opposition to the union, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on 9 October, wearing their pontifical vestments, went in procession to the Church of St. Nicholas and celebrated the Liturgy, at the conclusion of which Hermogenes, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Polotsk, mounted the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> and read the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate accepting the union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. When this had been read, the Latin and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> embraced each other and then repaired to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> of the Most Blessed Virgin to sing the "Te Deum" again. Next day another solemn <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was celebrated in the Church of St. Nicholas, and <a href="../cathen/14034a.htm">Father Skarga</a> preached on the unity of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">God's Church</a>. Bishops Gideon Balaban, of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, and Michael Kopystenski, of Przemysl, having declared themselves opposed to the union, were deposed and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> remained in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> until 1720. The enemies of the union published, on 9 October, a protest against the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> episcopate. The Prince of Ostrog became the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the opposition, and the struggle was maintained, particularly in the field of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. But Sigismund III efficaciously undertook the defence of the union; in an edict of 5 December, 1596, he ordered the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> to recognize as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only those who had accepted the act of union.

<p>Thus came to pass one of the most auspicious events in the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples. The Union of Brest would have produced most abundant fruit, and would have contributed greatly to the triumph of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> if the statesmen and the Latin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> had realized its political and religious utility, and had used all their efforts to favour it, and if, after the partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> had not destroyed it in the conquered provinces by methods of the most brutal <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.
