<h1>Unitarians</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberal</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which holds as it distinctive tenet the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a uni-personal instead of a <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">tri-personal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Name and doctrine</h2>

<p>In its general sense the name designates all disbelievers in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or non-Christian; in its present specific use it is applied to that organized form of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> which lays emphasis on the unity of the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The term seems to have originated about 1570, was used in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Diet held in 1600 at Lecsfalva in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, and received official ecclesiastic sanction in 1638. It supplanted the various designations of anti-Trinitarians, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, Racovians, and <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the name first appears in 1682. It became frequent in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> from 1815, although it was received unfavourably by some anti-Trinitarians, and omitted in their official titles by some congregations whose religious position it defined. The explanation of this opposition is to be found in the reluctance of the parties concerned to lay stress on any <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> affirmation. Historical associations account for the name Presbyerians, frequently applied to Unitarians in the British Isles, and Unitarian <a href="../cathen/04239a.htm">Congregationalists</a>, used in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. No definite standard of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is recognized in the denomination and no <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> tests are laid down as a condition of fellowship. The co-operation of all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> desirous of advancing the interests of "pure" (i.e. undogmatic, practical) <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is welcomed in the Unitarian body.

<p>In granting this co-operation each member enjoys complete freedom in his individual religious opinions, and no set of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> propositions could be framed on which all Unitarians would agree. The bond of union between them consists more in their anti-dogmatic tendency than in uniformity of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. The authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is in some degree retained; but its contents are either admitted or repudiated according as they find favor before the supreme, and in this case, exacting tribunal of individual reason. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is considered subordinate to the Father and, although the epithet <em>Divine</em> is in a loose sense not infrequently applied to Him, He is in the estimation of many an extraordinarily endowed and powerful but still a human religious leader. He is a teacher to be followed, not a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be worshipped. His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and Death are an inspiration and an example to His disciples, not an effective and vicarious atonement for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of men. He is the great exemplar which we ought to copy in order to perfect our union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gradually. This teaching concerning the mission of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is but the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> complement of the Unitarian denial of the Fall of Man and with similar consistency leads to the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Two of these (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and Eucharist) are indeed retained, but their grace-conferring power is denied and their reception declared unnecessary. Baptism is administered to children (rarely to adults) more for sentimental reasons and purposes for edification than from the persuasion of the spiritual results produced in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the recipient. The Eucharist, far from being considered as sacrificial, is looked upon as a merely memorial service. The fond hope of universal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is entertained by the majority of the denomination.

<p>In short, present-day Unitarianism is hardly more than natural religion, and exhibits in some of its members a pronounced tendency towards <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> speculation. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> polity in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and America is strictly congregational; each individual congregation manages, without superior control, all its affairs, calls and discharges its minister, and is the final judge of the religious views expressed in its <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>. In <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> government is exercised by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who resides at Kolozsv&aacute;r (Klausenburg) and is assisted by a consistory. The episcopal title which he bears does not imply special <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> but merely designates the office of an ecclesiatical supervisor.
<h2 id="section2">History</h2>
<h3 id="A">In Europe</h3>

<p>The first church holding Unitarian tenets was founded in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> during the reign of Sigismund II (1548-72). The year 1568 saw the establishment and official recognition of such congregations in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. While in the former country Unitarianism was completely supressed in 1660, in the latter it has, despite temporary <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, maintained itself. The <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvanian</a> Church is of <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinian</a> origin but has suppressed the worship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, thus casting off what chiefly differentiated it from strict Unitarianism. Its present name is the Hungarian Unitarian Church, although comparatively few of its members reside in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> proper.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the organization of Unitarianism was effected at a much later date. The first attempt at establishing a congregation was made by John Biddle (1615-62), but the organization did not last its author. More permanency attended the efforts of Theophilus Lindsey (1723-1808). In 1773 he seceded from the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Communion</a>, organized the following year a Unitarian congregation in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and in 1778 built the Essex Street <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. About the same time anti-Trinitarian views were spread by the scientist Joseph Priestly, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of a congregation at <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a> (1768-80) and later at <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>. His work in the latter place was cut short by a popular uprising in 1791, and three years later he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to America. Others, among them Thomas Belsham (1750-1829) and Lant Carpenter (1780-1840), continued to propagate Unitarianism in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Legal restrictions were still in vigour, however, against <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> denying the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity and hampered their work. But in 1813 most of these disabilities were removed, and in 1844 complete liberty was obtained, despite opposition, by the Dissenters' Chapels Act, sometimes called the Unitarian Charter. As early as 1825 English Unitarians had concluded a union with their co-religionists abroad under the name of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> and Foreign Unitarian Association. This <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> disseminated religious literature and promoted the interests of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. The prospects of this activity were brightened by the appearance of a capable exponent of Unitarian views, Dr. James Martineau (1805-1900). After a successful resistance to early opposition, his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> dominated English Unitariansm for an extended period. His writings exercised a potent influence far beyond <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and still continue to advance the cause of Liberal Christianity. His disciples have taken up his work and outstripped their master in his radical views.



<p>Scotland never <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a fruitful soil for Unitarian propaganda. A congregation was organized in 1776 in <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> and the Scottish Unitarian Association was formed in 1813; but progress in that country has been insignificant and there are very few congregations there. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> Unitarianism is held chiefly in the North where it has found adherants among the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>. It may not inappropriately be considered a self-governing branch of the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> body. Some Unitarian congregations are to be found also in the British colonies, notably Australia and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and among the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestants</a> a comparatively large number are Unitarian in view, though not in name.

<h3 id="B">America</h3>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century Unitarian opinions gained favor among New England <a href="../cathen/04239a.htm">Congregationalists</a>. They were propagated by Jonathan Mayhew (1720-1766), for nineteen years <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the West Church at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and Charles Chauncey (1705-87), in the same city. The first organized church was King's Chapel, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, when the congregation, until then Episcopal, removed in 1785 all references to the Trinity from the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a> and in 1787 assumed an independent existence. Congregations were also organized at <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a> and Saco (Maine) in 1792, and in 1794 Joseph Priestly began his propaganda in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. It was particularly in New England, however, that the movement gained ground. The appointment in 1805 of the Rev. Henry Ware to the Hollis chair of divinity at Harvard College and the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> within the next two years of four other Liberal candidates to important professorships in the same institution, brought that seat of learning under considerable Unitarian influence. Its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of divinity was endowed and organized by the denomination in 1817 and remained under its control until 1878, when it became nondenominational. While the diffusion of Unitarian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> was comparatively rapid the organization of churches was retarded by the reluctance of many to separate from the Congregationalist communities of which they were members. Before the separation was effected a heated controversy was waged between the liberal and conservative wings of Congregationalism. Matters came to a head in 1819 when the Rev. William Ellery Channing, in a sermon preached at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> at the installation of the Rev. Jared Sparks, advocated the public acknowledgement by the liberal members and congregations of their Unitarian <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. This discourse <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> decisive, and the parties concerned immediately proceeded to organize themselves independently. Frm this date until his death in 1842, Channing was the acknowledged leader of the denomination. Under his auspices the American Unitarian Association was founded at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in 1825 for the promotion of Unitarian interests.

<p>After his death the radical element became predominant under the direction of Theodore Parker (1810-60), who succeeded him in influence. The authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> acknowledged by the old <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was, under Parker, largely sacrificed to the principles of destructive criticism, and Unitarianism drifted rapidly into <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> speculation. The activity of Channing and Parker was supplemented by the more general and far-reaching influence of the Unitarian poet-philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82). Although he resigned his charge of the Second Congregational Church at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> after a short period (1829-32), he continued to preach for many years and his popularity as a writer and lecturer could not but lend additional prestige to the advanced religious views which he defended. The interests of the Unitarian propaganda were also served by the foundation of the Western Conference of Unitarians in 1852 and that of the National Unitarian Conference in 1865. Of a more universal character was the International Council of Unitarians and other Liberal Religious Thinkers and Workers, which was organized at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in 1900. It held sessions in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1901), Amsterdam (1903), Geneva (1905), <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (1907), and Berlin (1910). At the last-mentioned convention the official title was changed to International Congress of Free <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and Other Religious <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>. The purpose remains the same, namely: "to open communication with those in all lands who are striving to unite pure religion and perfect liberty and to increase fellowship and co-operation among them."
<h2 id="section3">Propaganda; educational institutions; statistics</h2>

<p>The Unitarian body sent a missionary to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1855, and since 1887 has carried on an active propaganda in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>; however, its missionary efforts in foreign languages, viewed in the aggregate, have not been considerable. In accordance with its general indifferent attitude toward <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, its endeavours to advance the cause of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> without emphasizing its own specific tenets, and its members have in the past contributed to the missionary funds of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. Their efforts, moreover, are more concerned with the dissemination of literature among civilized nations than with the sending of missionaries to non-Christian lands. This method of gaining adherants has proved successful, partly owing to the Liberal, <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a>, and excessively individualistic tendency of the present age, but largely also to the number of eminent men and capable writers who have adhered to or defended Unitarian doctrines. Financial resources for propagandist purposes were provided for by the rich Jamaica planter, Robert Hibbert (1770-1849), through the creation of the fund which bears his name. Out of it grew the well-known Hibbert Lectures, and the more recent "Hibbert Journal". An organization unique in its character is the Post Office Mission which, by means of correspondence and the distribution of books and periodicals, seeks to bring <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to the despondent and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the suffering.

<p>The Church has made no determined effort to organize benevolent institutions of its own. A considerable number of the Unitarian ministry (to which <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are admitted) receive their training in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, founded the following special <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for this purpose: in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, the Unitarian College at Kolozsv&aacute;r; in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, the Unitarian Home Missionary College at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>; the Manchester College at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> College at Carmarthen; in America, the Harvard Divinity School at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>; the Meadville Theological School at Meadville, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> <span class="stiki">This institution was later moved to Chicago, Illinos, and became known as the Meadville Lombard Theological School.</span>; and the Pacific Unitarian School (later renamed the Starr King School for the Ministry) at Berkelely, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the denomination maintains, besides these training-schools for the ministry, seven academies situated, but one exception, in the New England States. The number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> holding Unitarian views cannot be determined, even approximately; for many undoubtedly reject the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Three Divine Persons and retain the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a uni-personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> without ever affiliating with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Among these must be reckoned not only a large number of Liberal <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and advanced critics, but also some <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> which, either in their entirety, as the Hicksite Friends, or at least in many of their members, as the Unitarian-Universalists, are distinctly anti-Trinitarian. <span class="stiki">According to the <em>World Almanac</em>, in 1990 the Boston-based Unitarian Universalist Association numbered 173,000 in the United States. A 2007 Pew Forum survey placed that number at 340,000.</span>
