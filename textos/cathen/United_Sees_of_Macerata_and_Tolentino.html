<h1>United Sees of Macerata and Tolentino</h1>  

<p>Located in the Marches, Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Macerata is a provincial capital, situated on a hill, between the Chienti and the Potenza rivers, from which there is a beautiful view of the sea. Its name is derived from <em>maceries</em> (ruins), because the town was built on the ruins of Helvia Recina, a city founded by Septimus Severus, and destroyed by Alaric in 408, after which its inhabitants established the towns of Macerata and <a href="../cathen/12675a.htm">Recanati</a>. The former is mentioned apropos of the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and of Desiderius, King of the Lombards, after which time it fell into decadence. <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> restored it and, in 1290, established there a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> renewed by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> in 1540; this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> made Macerata the residence of the governors of the Marches, and thenceforth it was one of the towns most faithful to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> gave the city to Rudolfo Varani di <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> general; the people, however, drove him away, wishing to be governed directly by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In the fifteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a> of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> and Sforza of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> struggled for the possession of Macerata, from which the latter were definitely expelled in 1441. Later, the town became part of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. In 1797 it was pillaged by the French. It has a fine <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in which there is a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> by Calandra and a Madonna by <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a>. There are, also, the beautiful churches of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> della Pace (1323) and of the Madonna delle Vergini (1550), the latter designed by Galasso da Carpi. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has only the two faculties of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was created in 1320, after the suppression of that of <a href="../cathen/12675a.htm">Recanati</a>, which was re-established in 1516, independently of Macerata, to which last <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, in 1586, united the Diocese of Tolentino (a very ancient city in the province of Macerata), destroyed by the barbarians. Tolentino had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the fifth century, and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Catervus, the apostle of the city, is referred to the time of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>. Besides its fine <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, this town contains the beautiful church of <a href="../cathen/11065a.htm">St. Nicholas of Tolentino</a>, which belongs to the Augustinians, and in which is the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> (1310). Tolentino is famous as the place where was signed the treaty between <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, which gave Bologna, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and Romagna to the Cisalpine Republic. In 1815 was fought between Macerata and Tolentino the battle in which the Austrians defeated Murat and which cost the latter the throne of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>.

<p>Among the distinguished men of Macerata are G.B. Crescimbeni, a poet of the thirteenth century, and <a href="../cathen/04485a.htm">Mario Crescimbeni</a>, a man of letters of the seventeenth century and one of the founders of the Roman Arcadia; <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Father Matteo Ricci, S.J.</a>, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, and missionary to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; the architect Floriani who constructed the fortifications of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>. The united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> are suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a> and contain 25 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 46,200 inhabitants; within their territory are 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, and 9 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; they have 4 <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institutes for male students, and 4 for girls, and a monthly <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> publication.
