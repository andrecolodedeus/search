<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Unity (as a Mark of the Church)</h1>  

<p>The marks of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are certain unmistakeable signs, or distinctive characteristics which render the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> easily recognizable to all, and clearly distinguish it from every other religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, especially from those which claim to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and origin. That such external signs are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church is plain from the aim and the purpose which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had in view when He made His revelation and founded a Church. The purpose of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> was the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men. Hence, Christ made known the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which men must heed and obey. He established a Church to which He committed the care and the exposition of these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, and, consequently He made it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on all men that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and hear it (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs17">Matthew 18:17</a>). It is obvious that this Church, which takes the place of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and is to carry on His work by gathering men into its fold and saving their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, must be evidently discernible to all. There must be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the one which has received, and has preserved intact the Revelation which He gave it for man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Were it otherwise the purpose of the Redemption would be frustrated, the blood of the Saviour shed in vain, and man's eternal destination at the mercy of chance. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the all-wise legislator, impressed upon His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> some distinctive external marks by which, with the use of ordinary diligence, all can distinguish the real Church from the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the ranks of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. These marks flow from the very essence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; they are properties inseparable from its nature and manifestive of its character, and, in their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and proper sense, can be found in no other institution. In the Formula of the Council of Constantinople (A.D. 381), four marks of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are mentioned &#151; unity, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>, Apostolicity &#151; which are believed by most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to be exclusively the marks of the True Church. The present article considers unity.
<h2 id="section1">Some false notions of unity</h2>

<p>All admit that unity of some kind is indispensable to the existence of any well-ordered <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, civil, political, or religious. Many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, however, hold that the unity <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> need be nothing more than a certain spiritual internal bond, or, if external, it need be only in a general way, inasmuch as all acknowledge the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and reverence the same Christ. Thus most <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> think that the only union <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is that which comes from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward Christ; in worshipping the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, obeying the same Lord, and in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> the same fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. This they regard as a unity of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, organization, and cult. A like spiritual unity is all the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Greek schismatics</a> require. So long as they profess a common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are governed by the same general <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a> under a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and participate in the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, they look upon the various churches &#151; Constantinople, Russian, Antiochene, etc. &#151; as enjoying the union of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church; there is the common head, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the one Spirit, and that suffices. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> likewise teach that the one <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made up of three branches: the Greek, the Roman, and the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, each having a different legitimate <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> but all united by a common spiritual bond.
<h2 id="section2">True notion of unity</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> conception of the mark of unity, which must characterize the one Church founded by Christ, is far more exacting. Not only must the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church be one by an internal and spiritual union, but this union must also be external and visible, consisting in and growing out of a unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, worship, and government. Hence the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which has Christ for its founder is not to be characterized by any merely accidental or internal spiritual union, but, over and above this, it must unite its members in unity of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, expressed by external, public profession; in unity of worship, manifested chiefly in the reception of the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and in unity of government, by which all its members are subject to and obey the same authority, which was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. In regard to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> it may be here objected that in none of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> is there strict unity, since all of the members are not at all times aware of the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> to be believed. Some give assent to certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which others <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of. Here it is important to note the distinction between the habit and the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The habit or the subjective disposition of the believer, though specifically the same in all, differs numerically according to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but the objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to which assent is given is one and the same for all. There may be as many habits of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> numerically distinct as there are different <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> possessing the habit, but it is not possible that there be a diversity in the objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is manifested by all the faithful professing their adhesion to one and the same object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. All admit that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Supreme Truth, is the primary author of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and from their explicit willingness to submit to the same external authority to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given the power to make known whatever has been revealed, their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> explicitly unknown, is implicitly external. All are prepared to believe whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches. Similarly, accidental differences in ceremonial forms do not in the least interfere with essential unity of worship, which is to be regarded primarily and principally in the celebration of the same sacrifice and in the reception of the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. All are expressive of the one <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and subject to the same authority.


<h2 id="section3">The true Church of Christ is one</h2>

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which Christ instituted for man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> must be one in the strict sense of the term just explained, is already evident from its very nature and purpose; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one, Christ revealed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and gave it to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and men are to be saved by knowing and following the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But the essential unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">true Christian Church</a> is also explicitly and repeatedly declared throughout the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: <ul><li>Speaking of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Saviour called it a kingdom, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs24">Matthew 13:24, 31, 33</a>; <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs18">Luke 13:18</a>; <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs36">John 18:36</a>); <li>He compared it to a city the keys of which were entrusted to the Apostles (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs14">Matthew 5:14</a>; <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs19">16:19</a>), <li>to a sheepfold to which all His sheep must come and be united under one shepherd (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs7">John 10:7-17</a>); <li>to a vine and its branches, <li>to a house built upon a rock against which not even the powers of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> should ever prevail (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>). <li>Moreover, the Saviour, just before He suffered, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for His disciples, for those who were afterwards to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him &#151; for His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; that they might be and remain one as He and the Father are one (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#vrs20">John 17:20-23</a>); and <li>He had already warned them that "every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate: and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand" (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs25">Matthew 12:25</a>). </ul>These words of Christ are expressive of the closest unity.

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> likewise insists on the unity of the Church. <ul><li>Schism and disunion he brands as crimes to be classed with <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and debauchery, and declares that those guilty of "dissensions" and "sects" shall not obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs20">Galatians 5:20-21</a>). <li>Hearing of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> among the Corinthians, he asked impatiently: "Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of Paul?" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>). <li>And in the same Epistle he describes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as one body with many members distinct among themselves, but one with Christ their head: "For in one Spirit we are all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into one body, whether <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, whether bond or free" (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>). <li>To show the intimate union of the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he asks: "The <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of benediction, which we <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a>, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? For we, being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread" (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs16">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>). <li>Again in his Epistle to the Ephesians he teaches the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and exhorts them to be "careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace", and he reminds them that there is but "one body and one spirit-one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Father of all" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs3">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>). <li>Already, in one of his very first Epistles, he had warned the faithful of Galatia that if anybody, even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, should preach unto them any other Gospel than that which he had preached, "let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs8">Galatians 1:8</a>). </ul>Such declarations as these coming from the great Apostle are clear evidence of the essential unity which must be characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">true Christian Church</a>.

<p>The other Apostles also persistently proclaimed this essential and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> unity of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's Church</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs1">1 John 4:1-7</a>; <a href="../bible/rev002.htm#vrs6">Apocalypse 2:6, 14-15, 20-29</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#vrs1">2 Peter 2:1-19</a>; Jude 5:19). And although divisions did arise now and then in the early Church, they were speedily put down and the disturbers rejected, so that even from the beginning the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> could boast that they were of "one heart and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs32">Acts 4:32</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs22">Acts 11:22</a>; <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs1">13:1</a>).

<p>Tradition is unanimous to the same effect. Whenever <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> threatened to invade the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Fathers rose up against it as an essential <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <ul><li>The unity of the Church was the object of nearly all the exhortations of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> ("Ad Ephes.", n. 5, 16-17; "Ad Philadelph.", n. 3). <li>St. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> went even further, and taught that the test of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, in which alone was <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, was its union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Adv. haeres., III, iii). <li><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> likewise compared the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to an ark outside of which there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and he maintained that only he who embraced every <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> handed down by the Apostolic Churches, especially by that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church (De praescript., xxi). <li>The same contention was upheld by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> and by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who said that outside the one visible Church none could be saved. <li><a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> in his treatise on the unity of the Church says: "God is one, and Christ one, and one the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ" (De eccl. unitate, xxiii); and again in his epistles he insists that there is but "One Church founded upon Peter by Christ the Lord" (Epist. 70, ad Jan.) and that there is but "one altar and one <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>" (Epist. 40, v). </ul>Many more testimonies of unity might be adduced from Saints Jerome, Augustine, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, and the other Fathers, but their teachings are only too well known. The long list of councils, the history and treatment of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> in every century show beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that unity of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of cult, and of authority, has always been regarded as an essential and visible mark of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">true Christian Church</a>. As shown above, it was the intention of Christ that His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be one, and that, not in any accidental internal way, but essentially and visibly. Unity is the fundamental mark of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for without it the other marks would have no meaning, since indeed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself could not exist. Unity is the source of strength and organization, as discord and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> are of weakness and confusion. Given one <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> authority which all respect, a common <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which all profess, one form of worship subject to the same authority and expressive of the same teaching, centred in one sacrifice and in the reception of the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and the other marks of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> necessarily follow and are easily understood.

<p>That the mark of unity which is distinctive of and essential to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is to be found in none other than the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a>, follows naturally from what has been said. All the theories of unity entertained by the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> are woefully out of harmony with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and proper concept of unity as defined above and as taught by Christ, the Apostles, and all <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Tradition. In no other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body is there a oneness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of worship, and of discipline. Between no two of the hundreds of non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> is there a common bond of union; each one having a different head, a different <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, a different cult. Nay more, even between the members of any one <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> there is no such thing as real unity, for their first and foremost principle is that each one is free to believe and do as he wishes. They are constantly breaking up into new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and subdivisions of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, showing that they have within themselves the seeds of disunion and disintegration. Divisions and subdivisions have ever been the characteristics of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.
