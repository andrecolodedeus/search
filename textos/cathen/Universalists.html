<h1>Universalists</h1>  

<p>A Liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> &#151; found chiefly in North America &#151; whose distinctive tenet is the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the final <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of universal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> found favor among members of various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Churches (see <a href="../cathen/01599a.htm">APOCATASTASIS</a> for its treatment anterior to the foundation of the Universalist Church). The present article will exclusively consider Universalism as a separate denomination.
<h2 id="section1">Doctrinal principles</h2>

<p>The historic creed of this religious body is the profession of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> adopted by the General Convention at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, in 1803. It contains the following articles: <ol><li>We believe that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a> contain a revelation of the character of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, interest, and final destination of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. <li>We believe that there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whose nature is Love, revealed in one Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by one Holy Spirit of grace, who will finally restore the whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. <li>We believe that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> are inseparably connected, and that believers ought to be careful to maintain order and practise <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>; for these things are good and profitable unto men.</ol>

<p>To meet the objections raised by some Universalists to parts of the foregoing articles, a briefer statement of essential principles was adopted in 1899 by the General Convention held at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. It required for admission to fellowship the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the following articles: <ul><li>the universal fatherhood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <li>the spiritual authority and leadership of His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; <li>the trustworthiness of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as containing a revelation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of just retribution for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; <li>the final harmony of all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</ul> To the admission of these principles must be added "the acknowledgment of the authority of the General Convention and assent to its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>". <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">The Trinity</a> is usually rejected by present-day Universalists. The reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is not enjoined; but <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (according to the mode preferred by the candidate) and the Lord's Supper are administered. The infliction of temporal punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> insufficiently atoned for on earth is now generally admitted. A usage of distinctly Universalist origin is the observance of "Children's Sunday." A special day (the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in June) is set apart for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children and their dedication to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service. This observance has been taken over by other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches. For many years, the several Universalist congregations administered their own affairs independently, and the General Convention enjoyed merely advisory powers. The functions of this body were enlarged in 1866 and further extended in 1870, until it became the highest legislative authority for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.
<h2 id="section2">History &amp; institutions</h2>

<p>The first Universalist congregation was organized in 1750 in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> by Rev. James Relly, who ministered to its spiritual needs until his death (1778). In spite of this early establishment few Universalist churches exist at present in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; but Universalism is undoubtedly believed in outside of the denomination. The stronghold of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> is in America, where the first church was established by Rev. John Murray. He landed in New Jersey in September, 1770, preached the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Universalism along the Atlantic seaboard, and in 1779 formed with fifteen other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the first American congregation of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at Gloucester, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. Other preachers of the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> arose about this time: Elhanan Winchester, a former <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptist</a> minister, taught Universalism at Philadelphia, and Adams Streeter and Caleb Rich spread it in New England. More marked in its success and wider in the range of its influence was the propaganda of the Rev. Hosea Ballou (1771-1852), whose <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> views triumphed in the denomination over the Sabellian conception of the Trinity taught by Murray. His teaching of universal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> immediately after death, however did not meet with unanimous approval, and caused the secession of eight <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and some members who, under the name of Restorationists, founded a separate <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. But the existence of this new creation was short-lived (1831-41), while the parent body spread during Ballou's lifetime not only in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> but also to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Its progress was slowed by the Civil War, but the propaganda subsequently carried on, chiefly under the direction of the board of trustees and the state conventions, was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with some success, and the denomination spread throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>The denomination founded the following <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>: <ul><li>Tufts College (founded in 1852) Medford, Mass.; <li>Lombard College (1852), Galesburg, Illinois; <li>St. Lawrence University (1856), Canton, New York; <li>Buchtel College (1872), Akron, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>.</ul> A <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of divinity is connected with the first three institutions named. Academies are maintained at Franklin <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> (Dean Academy); Barre, Vermont (Goddard Seminary); and Portland, Maine (Westbrook Seminary).
