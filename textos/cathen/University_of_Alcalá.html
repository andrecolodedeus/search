<h1>University of Alcal&aacute;</h1>  

<p>This <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> may be said to have had its inception in the thirteenth century, when Sancho IV, the Brave, King of Castile, conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding a <em>Studium Generale</em> in Alcal&aacute; de Henares, and (20 May, 1293), conferred full faculties on the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, Gonzalo Gudiel, to carry out his plan. What success attended these efforts is, however, not known; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only that on 16 July, 1459, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> gave permission to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, Alonso Carrillo, to establish some professorships where, "on certain days at the time appointed or to be appointed", grammar and the liberal arts would be taught. It does not appear that the chairs of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law were established then, and even grammar was taught only irregularly in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Diego. The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of founding the University, or more properly speaking, the College, of San Ildifonso, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Francisco Ximenez de Cisneros, Prime Minister of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, who submitted his plan to <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a>, and received his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> 13 April, 1499. Nevertheless, prior to this there existed "certain chairs in some of the faculties", as he himself says in his petition. The Pope granted to the College of San Ildefonso the same concessions allowed to the College of San Bartolom&eacute; at Salamanca, and to the college founded at Bologna by Cardinal Albornoz. To the professors and scholars he granted the privileges enjoyed by those of Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, and the other General Colleges. He conferred the degree of Bachelor on the professors, and Doctor of Laws and Master of Arts on the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, or, in his absence, on the treasurer, of the Collegiate Church of San Justo and San Pastor. Those who were thus <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> enjoyed the same privileges as the professors of Bologna, and other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and could occupy <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> stalls for which <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> degrees were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> (13 May, 1501). In 1505 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> were aggregated to the <em>Collegium scholarium</em>, and 22 January, 1512, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> published the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the College. Denifle says that research in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> regarding this <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is incomplete and inexact. Meiners and Savigny <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing regarding its origin; the dates are not reliable even in Hefele and <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>. Neither can Rashdall's assertion that "the Universities of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were essentially royal creations" (II, pt. I, p. 69) be sustained here. On 24 July, 1508, Cisneros went to Alcal&aacute; with a scholastic colony recruited in Salamanca to found his College of San Ildefonso. The <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was to be chosen by the students (not by the professors, as was the custom at Salamanca) each year about the feast of St. Luke when studies were resumed. The older students were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> was excluded, although the canonists introduced it in the seventeenth century. Besides <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and canon law, the course of study included <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, medicine, Hebrew, Greek, rhetoric, and grammar. Demetrio de Creta was engaged to teach Greek, and the mathematician, Pedro Ciruelo, explained the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. Cisneros not only founded a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but built a new town, certain portions of which were devoted to the houses of the students and booksellers. Numerous colleges also sprang up; Santa Catalina and Santa Balbina for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; San Eugenio and San Isidoro for grammarians; and the Triling&uuml;e. He erected a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> for the students, and established three places of recreation: the Abbey of San Tuy, near Buitrago; the Aldehuela, near Torrelaguna; and the Anchuelo, near Alcal&aacute;. Soon, however, a spirit of insubordination began to show itself in the wrangling of the students with the townspeople, the severe Cisneros apparently showing a strange leniency towards the students. This want of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> caused the faculty in 1518 to consider the advisability of returning to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. Some of the professors left the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> because of the reduction of their salaries. In 1623 an effort was once more made to return to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, but the change was not effected until 1822, and even then it was not permanent, as they returned to Alcal&aacute; in 1823. The final and definite removal took place in 1836. The revenues left to the College of San Ildefonso by Cisneros reached the sum of 14,000 ducats, and in the sixteenth century reached 42,000, or 6,000 less than those of Salamanca. The celebrated grammarian, Antonio de Nebrija, received 3,333 maravedis a month; the professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, Dr. Tarragona, was paid 53,000 a year, and Demetrio de Creta an equal sum (100 florins). Cisneros enforced very rigid examinations. In the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course which was divided into ten terms, there were five tests. The first and most dreaded was the <em>Alfonsina</em>, which corresponded to that of the Sorbonne of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Those who failed usually went to other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. To the successful licentiates, <em>letras de orden</em> were given, the first being designated by an L, and the others by superior or inferior letters, according to their merit. The number of students never exceeded 2,000, one-third of the attendance at Salamanca. About 1570 the magnificent building of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was completed, the twenty-five letters of the motto E<font size=-2>T</font> L<font size=-2>UTEAM</font> O<font size=-2>LIM</font> M<font size=-2>ARMOREAM</font> N<font size=-2>UNC</font> being displayed on as many columns. The patronage exercised by the kings over the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> they had founded or protected led to the sending of visitors and reformers. The principal one sent to the University of Alcal&aacute; was Don Garc&iacute;a de Medrano. The reforms which were instituted brought to an end the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> autonomy which had been cherished and encouraged by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
