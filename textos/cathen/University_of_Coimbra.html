<h1>University of Coimbra</h1>  

<p>The earliest certain information concerning a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> dates from 1288, when the Abbott of Alcobaza, several <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, made known to <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> that they had obtained from King Diniz the foundation of a "Studium Generale" at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and had arranged among themselves to defray the salaries of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and masters from the revenues of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches; they besought the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to confirm this agreement and to protect the work they were undertaking "for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the glory of their country". In a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 9 August, 1290, addressed to the "University of the masters and students of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>", the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> acceded to their request and expressed his satisfaction with the creation of this new seat of studies. This <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> sanctions taxation of lodgings in the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna fashion, grants <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from residence to masters and students and authorizes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> (or, <em>sede vacante</em>, the Vicar-capitular), to confer the <em>jus ubique docendi</em> on all faculties except Theology. Frequent quarrels between the students and the citizens led the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to request the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to transfer the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, a more tranquil place, and to grant at the same time to the new foundation, all of the "privileges" of the former one. The transfer took place 15 February, 1308, on which date King Diniz issued the charter of foundation, quite similar to that of Alfonso the wise for the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> in Castile. The <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> then taught at Coimbra were canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, medicine, dialectic, and grammar. Theology was taught in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. For reasons unknown to us, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was again moved to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1339, by order of Alfonso IV. In 1354 it returned to <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, only to be transferred to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1377. From this time until its final transfer to Coimbra in 1537, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> enjoyed greater prosperity. At the beginning of the fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> appears regularly as one of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> taught there.

<p>During the reign of John III (1521-57) important reforms were carried out, and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> reached the acme of its career. The faculties hitherto widely scattered in different edifices were brought together under one roof in the "Palacio del Rey", new and illustrious professors were invited from <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>; for the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Alfonso de Prado and Antonio de Fonseca, the latter a doctor of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; for the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> the famous canonist <a href="../cathen/01793b.htm">Martin de Aspilcueta</a> (Doctor Navarrus), Manuel de Costa, and Antonio Francisco Su&aacute;rez, all three from Salamanca; and for medicine Francisco Franco and Rodrigo Reinoso. The classical languages and literatures were taught in the Colegio de la Artes, as a preparation for the graver studies of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; this college was at first quite independent of the latter, but was eventually incorporated with it and confided to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. One of its first professors was the Scotch Latinist, George Buchanan, later a follower of <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">John Knox</a> and a reviler of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>. The colleges of S&iuml;o Pedro and S&iuml;o Paolo were founded for graduates (doctors) who purposed to devote themselves to teaching; other colleges were founded for the students of various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in which they might follow the common life while pursuing their studies at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. New reforms were inaugurated in 1770, when (23 December) King Jos&eacute; I, on the initiative of the <a href="../cathen/16075a.htm">Marquis de Pombal</a>, appointed a commission to consider the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The commission advised the creation of two new faculties, mathematics and natural philosophy, leaving intact the older faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, canon law, <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and medicine. New professors were brought from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Michele Franzini for mathematics, and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Vandelli for natural history. The former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, confiscated at the time of the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, was turned over to the faculty of medicine for its clinics and laboratories. The laboratories for physics, chemistry, and natural history were also located there; finally a botanical garden was added. At the end of the eighteenth century, metallurgy was taught by Jos&eacute; Bonifacio de Andrade, and hydraulics by Manoel Pedro de Mello, both scholars of repute. In 1907 the University of Coimbra had five faculties, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, medicine, mathematics, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Its professors numbered (1905-06) 68, and its students 2916. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> now contains about 100,000 volumes. (See <a href="../cathen/04252a.htm">CONIMBRICENSES</a>.)
