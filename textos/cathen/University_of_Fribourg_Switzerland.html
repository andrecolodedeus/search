<h1>University of Fribourg (Switzerland)</h1>  

<p>From the sixteenth century, the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> had often been canvassed among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons. The need of such an institution was with the passage of time ever more keenly felt, as the fact that higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> existed only in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons ensured for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> ascendancy. In spite of the pressing nature of the case, however, the want of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means and the jealousy among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons combined to prevent any solution of the question being arrived at. From the very beginning, the inhabitants of Fribourg had laboured most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in their town. Out of their own resources, they founded in 1763 a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of law, which was continued till 1889 and then merged in the juristic faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. During the nineteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, making the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/12139a.htm">"Pius-Verein"</a> its rallying-centre, reinaugurated the agitation for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Conservative Government of Fribourg finally took the matter in hand, and George Python, State Councillor for Fribourg and from 1886 Director of Public Education, who enjoyed the fullest confidence of the people, effected the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. It was certainly a bold undertaking for a little state of only 119,000 (in 1909, 130,000) inhabitants, but the energy and political acumen of Python coupled with the unselfish liberality of the legislative council were a certain guarantee of success. The conversion of the public <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> under favourable conditions in 1886 resulted in a saving of 2,500,000 francs (500,000 dollars), and on 24 December of the same year the supreme council resolved to set aside this sum as a foundation fund for the proposed <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. On 4 October, 1889, a second resolution was passed, appropriating the interest on this capital to the foundation of the first faculties, which were opened in the following November, the juristic faculty (the extended <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of law) with nine professors and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> (for philosophy, literature, and history) with eighteen.

<p>The town of Fribourg, seat of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, contributed half a million francs towards the funded capital of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in the autumn of 1890 the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty was instituted with seven professors, In accordance with an agreement between the Government of Fribourg and Father Larocca, General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, this faculty was with the sanction of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, and placed directly under the care of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, however, have held chairs in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, which has received from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the privilege of granting academical degrees (baccalaureate, licentiate, doctorate) in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The other faculties confer only the degrees of licentiate and doctorate. By the appropriation to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of the profit on the public supply of water and electricity, and of a fixed annual sum from the newly-founded state bank, the further development of these three faculties and the establishment of the faculty of mathematical physics were made possible. The new faculty was opened in 1895 with eleven professors, and, as the institution of infirmaries has already been some years in progress, the establishment of the medical faculty-the only story now needed to crown the academical edifice-may be expected at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Meanwhile, chairs of physiology and bacteriology have been instituted in connexion with the faculty of mathematical physics.

<p>Despite many difficulties, including the crisis caused by the wanton dismissal of eight German professors in 1898, the development of the University of Fribourg has been steadily maintained. As a cantonal public institution, it stands on the same legal footing as the other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The supreme authority is vested in the Cantonal Department of Public Education (i.e the State Council), practically all the expenses being borne by the canton. The general constitution of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is regulated by the Charter of 1 December, 1899. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> viewed its foundation with a great satisfaction to which he gave personal expression in many letters to the authorities of the Canton, to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> itself, and to the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> episcopate. The main sources of revenue, according to the cantonal budget for 1909, are as follows: <a href="../cathen/08077a.htm">Interest</a> on foundation fund, 125,000 francs; yearly contributions from state bank, 80,000 frs.; profits arising from the electric and water works, 150,000 frs.; lease, 2,580 frs. To this sum of 357,580 frs. must be added 7700 frs. for the legal chairs and other endowments (especially the "Grivel" and the "Westermaier"). Many funds have been established for the assistance of students, and the institution of prizes.

<p>In accordance with the wishes of its founder, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has always maintained an international character, which consists not alone in the appointment of native professors to teach the history and literature of their native lands, but also in the various nationalities of the students attracted to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The lectures are delivered in Latin, French, and German. In the winter term of 1908-9, the teaching staff consisted of 70 lecturers from ten different lands, but especially from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Their distribution among the faculties was as follows: Theology, 13 ordinary and 2 extraordinary professors; Law, 14 ordinary and 4 extraordinary professors; Philosophy, 19 ordinary and 3 extraordinary professors; Mathematical Physics 10 ordinary and 3 extraordinary professors with 2 Privatdozen. The increase in the attendance at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> may be judged from this table of matriculated students:</p>

<p>Of the 568 students in the winter term of 1908-9 181 were <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, 90 Germans, 86 Russians (Poles and Lithuanians), 32 <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, 31 <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, 23 from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, 21 from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, and the remainder from eleven other lands.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is governed by the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, elected each year at the general meeting of the ordinary professors. He is assisted by the senate, which consists of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, pro-rector, and the deans and assistant deans of the separate faculties. At the head of each faculty stands the dean, who also holds office for a single year. The professors are appointed by the Council of State on the recommendation of the members of the faculty concerned, except that in the appointment of professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> due attention is always paid to the requirements of ecclesiastical law and the terms of the agreement with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>. Candidates are recognized as matriculated students on the production of a certificate which can be procured by following a certain course of academical studies in their native towns. Since 1905, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are allowed to matriculate, and, in addition to the regular students, permission may be given by the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to attend particular lectures. As such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> numbered 119 in the winter term 1908-9, the total number of students who attended lectures during this period was 687. All the matriculated students are enrolled in a general association, called the "Akademia", and also contribute to an academic sick-fund. Many <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> have been founded by the students of various lands for the promotion of social and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> intercourse. Thus, the "Columbia" has been instituted by the students from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and publishes its own bulletin "The Columbia". There are three colleges for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students: the Albertinum, Salesianum, and Canisianum, A special <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has been inaugurated to further the interests of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is associated with that of the canton (which contains 140,000 volumes, 16,000 brochures, 534 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and 350 incunabula), a new building for the accommodation of both <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> having been opened in 1908. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> expends an annual sum of 16,500 frs. in the purchase of books and journals. There are separate <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> for the different academical courses and institutes, 7650 frs. being spent annually on those in connection with the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, legal, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculties, and 30,000 frs. for those of the faculty of mathematical physics. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has its own scientific publication, the "Collectanea Friburgensia", for which only contributions from professors are accepted, and in which twenty-five works have already appeared in three series. The list of the publications of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> lecturers, which is appended to the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector's</a> annual report, gives one a good <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the activity of the professors in other directions.
