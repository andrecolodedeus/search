<h1>University of Graz</h1>  

<p>The University of Graz, located in the capital of the Province of Steiermark, owes its establishment to the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> and the efforts of Archduke Karl von Steiermark, who, in 1584, requested <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> to grant autonomous <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> privileges to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Graz, which had been founded in 1578 and was already possessed of a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The documents of the archducal foundation and of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> recognition are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 January, 158R The latter, however, was not made publie until 15 April, 1586, the occasion being the dedication exercises of the institution as a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and it bore the signature of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. The letter of recognition of Emperor Rudolf II followed soon after. The archduke endowed the seat of learning with a yearly income and set aside for its benefit a certain proportion of the products yielded by Government lands. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> directed the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in charge to give public instruction in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and the liberal arts, as was customary in other advanced <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of a similar character. The first scholastic year of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> began in 1586.

<p>Subsequent to the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>, Archduke Ferdinand signed on behalf of the institution which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had created a second document of foundation, in which he confirmed its purpose as set forth in the original <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, declaring it to be "the service of the Holy Roman Catholic Religion", and placed it on a solid material basis. He enriched it with new buildings and presented it with the revenues and full <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supremacy of M&uuml;hlstatt, in Carinthia, and of other estates of the Crown, including the right of independent <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and exemption from the payment of duties and taxes. He obtained from <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> a confirmation of the M&uuml;hlstatt grant, with which the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Graz had been given <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the whole of that principality. He founded a <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a> for poor students, which was called the <em>Ferdinandeum</em> Another and similar foundation was the Josephinum, which was raised by private subscriptions (1748-49). It was not long before the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> claimed for itself <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> powers in the district of M&uuml;hlstatt; but a settlement was reached at a trial held in 1659, whereby on the one hand the ordinariate powers and independent <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Graz were recognized, while on the other certain concessions were made to the <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Diocese of Salzburg</a>. Legal proceedings with the K&auml;rnten authorities regarding the exemption of the M&uuml;hlstatt district from <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> taxes, which proceedings lasted more than one hundred years, resulted in a defeat for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a> in 1755.

<p>This institution of Graz was the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> centre of activity in their labours for the reclaiming of Steiermark to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. Here was prepared all the material <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for such a mission, here <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> influence found a new source of strength in the founding of academic sodalities of Mary and other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of like import. Its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> festivals were celebrated with dramas of a spiritual as well as profane character and with farces and comedies in Latin and German, which were produced in the college theatre. The chief aim of these plays was to awaken sentiments of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and patriotism, and they formed a notable addition to the dramatic literature of the day.

<p>As early as the year 1604, Georg Stob&auml;us von Palmburg, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09049a.htm">Lavant</a>, advocated the further broadening of the University of Graz by the addition to its staff of a faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. But though negotiations were undertaken to this end between the institution and the Government, the former's insistence that its autonomy should remain unimpaired caused these negotiations to be suspended until the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>. After the establishment, in Graz, of private courses in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> outside of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and the execution of a reform in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies by the appointment of State Directors of Studies and the altering of examination methods, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was placed in 1760 under the supervision of a State Commission of Studies designated for this purpose, and therefore lost almost entirely its monastic character of the Josephine period. The year 1773 proved to be, owing to the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>, the last <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> year of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Graz. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> became a State institution, its material possessions were seized upon for the public treasury, and its course of instruction was remodelled to conform with that laid down by the newly-established imperial Commission of Studies for the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>. The winter of 1778 saw the inauguration of a faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> which consisted of two professors, while higher instruction in medicine was likewise introduced, which received gradual development. At the end of 1782 <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> converting the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> into a lyceum with four faculties and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to award degrees in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The number of instructors was restricted to twelve. But the Lyceum of Graz recovered in the summer of 1827 its former rank and name as a university, through a grant of the Emperor Francis. Its faculty of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> grew steadily, and a duly organized faculty of medicine was added by an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of January, 1868. The <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater Gr&aelig;censis has since then occupied the third place among the institutions of learning in German-speaking <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The technical high school which had been founded in 1814 was taken over by the State in 1874.
