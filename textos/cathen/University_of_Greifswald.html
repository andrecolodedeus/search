<h1>University of Greifswald</h1>  

<p>The oldest <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, founded in 1456. Even before this, Greifswald had, for a short time, been the seat of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1436, when on account of dissensions among the townspeople, the <a href="../cathen/13205b.htm">University of Rostock</a> was placed under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> by the Council of Basle, it was removed to Greifswald with the consent of the same council, where it remained for seven years. After the return of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to <a href="../cathen/13205b.htm">Rostock</a>, six professors remained at Greifswald, whereupon the burgomaster, Heinrich Rubenow, himself a doctor of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and a member of one of the most influential and aristocratic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the city, conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of establishing a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in his native city. Pope <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of foundation on 29 May, 1456, and on 17 October the dedication the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> took place, Rubenow, as vice-chancellor and first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, admitting 173 students to matriculation. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Kammin was chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, for the support of which Duke Wratislaw, IX, of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> and his successors set apart, in addition to certain sums of money, the revenues from certain villages and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. He and Rubenow also established, in connection with the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of canons, the members of which were at the same time teachers in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. During the first years the Greifswald professors were frequently drawn from <a href="../cathen/13205b.htm">Rostock</a> and Leipzig, and among them, as among the students, were many Danes and Swedes. At the instance of the Greifswald council, the preacher Johann Knipstro proclaimed the reformed doctrines in the city. Duke Philipp I, who being the son of <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatine</a> Princes Amalie, had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the court of Heidelberg, in 1534 introduced the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> into his territories, thus becoming the founder of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>. The confusion and dissensions of these years affected the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> seriously; for twelve years the lectures were entirely suspended. They were resumed in 1539, under the auspices of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, with one professor for each of the three upper faculties, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> being established in the suppressed <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.

<p>Philipp I and his sons, in compensation for its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which had been turned over to the Reformed Church, endowed the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with the land of suppressed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> the city and University of Greifswald suffered severely. In 1562 the last Duke of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, who was without issue, settled on the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> as patrimony the former <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Eldena, with all its estates, including about twenty villages, in order that the arrears of salary might be paid to the professors, and their future provided for. Although this monastic <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was in a sadly neglected condition and heavily burdened with <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, the ten professors accepted the royal gift, which, however, did not yield sufficient revenue to maintain the professors until after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> and Sweden. When, in 1637, <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> was annexed to Sweden of which it remained a possession after the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 1648, Queen Christine repeatedly assisted the Greifswald professors from the royal treasury. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Brandenburg and Sweden, and likewise during the Northern War, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> suffered frequent and serious injury, its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was almost deserted. Not until after the Peace of <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> (1720) was order restored. In 1730 the foundation of the Society for the Collection and Investigation of National History and Law (Gesellschaft zur Sammlung und Erforschung f&uuml;r die Landesgeschichte und das Landesrecht) and the German Language and German Poetry (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur die Veredulung der deutschen Sprache und Dichtung) occasioned lively literary activity.

<p>In 1775 Gustavus III imposed on the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> a new constitution affecting the organization of the teaching body, the several institutions of learning, the administration of its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> governing the student body. By the second Peace of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, in 1815, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> was ceded to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>, and the University of Greifswald, which had suffered greatly during the Napoleonic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, gradually became a highly respected <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, especially for medicine and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a>. The institutions connected with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> were at the same time improved and enlarged, and many new ones were founded and organized along the most approved lines, e.g. the zoological, anatomical, and physiological institutes, the botanical garden, the institutes of chemistry and physics, the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and the clinics. In the exhibition of modern lecture-halls, operating rooms, and equipment, at the World's Fair of St. Louis the surgical and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> clinic of Greifswald received one of the five grand prizes that went to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The increase in the revenues of the estates belonging to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> helped greatly to defray the expenses of the new institutions. The forest land alone yields an annual income of approximately twenty-five thousand dollars, and the rentals over a hundred thousand dollars. During the scholastic year 1908-09, 786 students attended the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Of late years the competition of Kiel and M&uuml;nster and of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> established in the larger cities has so affected Greifswald that now the number of students enrolled is less than at any other <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>.
