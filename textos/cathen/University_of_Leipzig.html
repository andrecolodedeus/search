<h1>University of Leipzig</h1>  

<p>The University of Leipzig in Saxony is, next to Heidelberg, the oldest <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. It was established when the German students under the leadership of Johannes of M&uuml;nsterberg, who had been deposed as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> by King Wenceslaus, left Prague in May, 1409, and went to Leipzig. The cause of this withdrawal was national disorders provoked in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> by <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a>. At Leipzig Friedrich and Wilhelm, Landgraves of Thuringia and Margraves of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, founded a <em>studium generale</em>, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> for the foundation being issued by <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Pope Alexander V</a> at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, 9 September. 1409. The charter was signed on 2 December of the same year, and the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was Johannes of M&uuml;nsterberg. In the first semester 369 students matriculated. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Merseburg was appointed chancellor. At the opening of the sixteenth century Leipzig was, like Cologne, a stronghold of scholasticism and a large part of the "Epistol&aelig; virorum obscurorum", written in Erfurt near by, refers to it. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, remained true to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, while <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, founded in 1502, was a starting-point for <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. During the period of religious dissension the University of Leipzig declined greatly. Through the efforts of its <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, Kaspar Borner, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> obtained from Duke Maurice of Saxony an annual grant of 2000 gold gulden. In 1543 it was housed in the Paulinum, a secularized <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1559 the amendment of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, Joachim Camerarius, was completed. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> suffered considerably from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, epidemics, and the billeting of soldiers. It remained, however, especially in the eighteenth century, a centre of scholarly and literary activity, well-known representatives of which were Johann Christian Gottsched and Christian F&uuml;rchtegott Gellert.

<p>In 1768 Prince Joseph Alexander Jablonowsk&#255; founded a learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for history, mathematics, physics, and economics, which is still in existence. The Linn&aelig;an Society for the Advancement of the Natural Sciences was founded in 1789, and in 1824 was united with the Society for Physical Research. In 1812 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> dropped its <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character; and in 1830 received a new constitution. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of King Anthony of Saxony abolished the old division of professors and students into "nations" and entrusted the administration of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and the four faculties. By a ministerial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1851, the body of the ordinary professors form the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> assembly; they elect the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and a member of the Lower House of the Saxon Diet, and have the bestowal of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Besides this assembly there is a smaller body, the senate, composed of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, the pro-rector, the four deans, and twelve representatives elected by the faculties. In 1836 a new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> building named the Augusteum, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Frederick Augustus, first King of Saxony, was opened; in 1871 an auditorium called the Bornerianum, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> Kaspar Borner, was added to the Augusteum. In the summer of 1897 there was opened a new building, erected from the plans of Arved Rossbach, on the site of the original <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. From old and new donations the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has a large endowment in land and funds, over which the <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> Government has the right of supervision and administration. In 1909 its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> amounted to thirty-one million marks. The basis of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> consists of the valuable collections taken from the suppressed Saxon <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; it contains about 600,000 volumes and 6500 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. At the instance of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of that period, Dukes Maurice and Augustus of Saxony founded, 22 April, 1544, a refectory (<em>mensa communis</em>) for needy students, where meals could be obtained either without cost, or at moderate prices. At the present day from two to three hundred students share in this privilege.

<p>Among the distinguished scholars may be mentioned: in the evangelical <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, Tischendorf, Luthardt, and the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>, Hauck; in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, von W&auml;chter, and Windscheid; the Germanic scholar Wilhelm Albrecht, and his pupil von Gerber, later Minister of Worship and Education in Saxony; the historians of German <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, Stobbe and Sohm, and the authorities on criminal law, Binding and Wach. More than one fifth of all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> students of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the years 1875-85 took a part of their course at Leipzig. At the Present date the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> faculty of Leipzig ranks third in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, after Berlin and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. In the medical faculty, Benno Schmidt, Trendelenburg, and K&ouml;lliker have especially aided in the advancement of surgery; in <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, Bock and His; in pathological <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, Birch-Hirschfeld and Marchand; physics and physiology, Ludwig; in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty, Weber, the founder of psychophysics Volkelt, writer on &aelig;sthetics; the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Gustav Theodore Fechner, and Wilhelm Wundt, the founder of the widely known institute for experimental <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>. Pedagogics developed at Leipzig into an independent <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and, when a pedagogical <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was founded by Ziller in 1861, the study acquired a still greater importance. In the department of classical philology should be mentioned the names of Hermann, <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>, Ribbeck, and the arch&aelig;ologist Overbeek; in Germanic philology, Haupt and Zarncke; in comparative philology, Brugmann; in the languages of Eastern <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, Conradi; in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of history, Mommsen and Lamprecht, who of late years has been known far beyond the circle of specialists in his department. In political economy, Roscher was the founder of the historical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; also Bucher, who is well known for his investigations into the relations of the State to trade and manufacture, and applied statistics. The matriculated students at Leipzig number nearly 5000.
