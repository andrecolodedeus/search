<h1>University of M&uuml;nster</h1>  

<p>The town of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> obtained its <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1771 through the initiative of the prince-bishop's <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a>, <a href="../cathen/06325a.htm">Freiherr von F&uuml;rstenberg</a>.

<p>The foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, which dated from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, about the end of the fifteenth century, had reached a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> through the efforts of the famous <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> Rudolph von Langen (1438-1519). The disturbances caused by the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> (1533-35) had a depressing influence, but Dean Gottfried von Raesfeld succeeded in restoring it to its former position by turning its supervision over to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1588. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, now called Gymnasium Paulinum, was enlarged by the addition of courses in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for the scientific <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and was raised by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> to the rank of an academy, 9 Sept., 1629. The latter action was taken at the urgent request of Prince-Bishop Ferdinand I (1612-31), who also obtained from the Emperor Ferdinand II the document of 21 May, 1631, in which the latter granted permission to found a complete <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with four faculties. The death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the disturbances of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> and the want of funds prevented the execution of this plan during the next century and a half. The clever work of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> Franz Friedrich von F&uuml;rstenberg finally accomplished the desired end: on 4 August, 1771, Prince-Bishop Maximilian Friedrich von K&ouml;nigseck-Rotenfels signed the document making M&uuml;nster a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Pope Clement XIV</a> granted to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, in a bull <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 28 May, 1773, all the privileges, <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> and liberties which other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> enjoyed. The charter, signed by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 Oct. of the same year. For more than thirty years F&uuml;rstenberg, as curator, laboured earnestly for the development of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. He filled it with the spirit of positive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, so that it had a beneficent influence at a time when <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> philosophy and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> enlightenment appeared everywhere. In 1803 M&uuml;nster was ceded to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> by the imperial deputation assembled at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> administrator of M&uuml;nster, Baron von Stein, showed great interest in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but endeavoured to do away with its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> character. His successor, President von Vincke, accomplished this purpose and dismissed F&uuml;rstenberg, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, in 1805. In the autumn of 1806 the French took possession of the town. During the seven years' sway of the foreigners no remarkable progress was made in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. After M&uuml;nster had again become <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> in 1813, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> government raised the question whether the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> should be reorganized or removed to another town. No decision was reached until King Frederick William III in 1815 promised his new subjects on the left bank of the Rhine that a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> would be established on the Rhine. The founding of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> carried with it the abolition of that of M&uuml;nster, which took place in the summer of 1818. Only one <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course, and, by way of preparation for the same, a philological and scientific course, remained, under the name of an academy. While this academy possessed the character of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the right of conferring degrees, it was conducted on a rather modest scale. A department of medicine, which had been started in 1821, was discontinued in 1848. It was not until 1870 that the increasing importance of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as a nation infused new life into the endeavour to uplift the academy. In 1880 the modeling of the present magnificent main edifice of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was completed, and in 1886 there was added to the academy a pharmaceutical institute. The continued efforts of the town and of the province of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> finally led to the issue of a royal decree, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 July, 1902, restoring to the academy a faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the title "University" (since 1907 "Westph&auml;lische Wilhelms-Universit&auml;t", in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Emperor William II). In 1906 there followed the establishment of the chairs and institutions required for the first half of the course in medicine, the further extension of which may be expected in the next few years.

<p>Noteworthy among the teachers of the old episcopal <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> were: Clemens Becker, S.J., professor of canon law and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> (d. 1790); Joh. Hyac. Kistemaker, philologist and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, who taught the classical languages from 1786 to 1834, and, later on, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. A. M. Sprickmann laboured as a jurist in M&uuml;nster from 1778 to 1814, when he was called to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> and later, in 1817, to Berlin. Anton Bruchhausen, S.J., professor of physics (1773-82), gained a great reputation among German scientists through his "Institutiones physic&aelig;" (1775); and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Havichhorst (1773-83) through his "Institutiones <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>&aelig;". <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">George Hermes</a> was professor of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> in M&uuml;nster from 1807-20; he founded the so-called <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesianism</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> tendency in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and d. in 1831 at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, where he taught from 1820; his teachings were condemned at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1836. J. Th. H. Katerkamp, who was counted among the friends of <a href="../cathen/06367a.htm">Princess Galitzin</a>, was professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Of the teachers in the academy there deserve to be mentioned the neo-scholastic St&ouml;ckl, professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> (1862-71); furthermore, Wilhelm Storck, interpreter of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> poems (Camoens) and professor of <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German literature</a> (1859-1905); and especially Johann Wilhelm Hittorf, since 1852 professor of physics and chemistry, who discovered the cathode rays, and made valuable investigations concerning electric phenomena in vacuum tubes and contributions to the theory of ions. Mention should also be made of Professors <a href="../cathen/13415a.htm">Berlage</a> (dogmatics), Reinke (<a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetics</a>), and Bisping (<a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> exegetus), <a href="../cathen/13592a.htm">Schwane</a> (dogmatics).

<p>The number of matriculated students is at present: summer of 1910, 2008 (including 68 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>); there are besides 115 auditors. Teachers: in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, 9 ordinary and 2 extraordinary professors, 2 dozents and 1 lecturer; in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> faculty, 7 ordinary and 3 extraordinary professors, 4 dozents; in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty, 28 ordinary and 6 extraordinary professors, 14 dozents, and 4 lecturers; in the medical faculty, 1 extraordinary and 2 ordinary professors, 2 lecturers, 1 dozent.
