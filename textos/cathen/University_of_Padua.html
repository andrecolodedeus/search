<h1>University of Padua</h1>  

<p>The University of Padua dates, according to some anonymous chronicles (Muratori, "Rer. Ital. Script.", VIII, 371, 421, 459, 736), from 1222, when a part of the Studium of Bologna including professors and students withdrew to Padua. The opinion that <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> transferred the Studium of Bologna to Padua in 1241 is groundless. But even before this emigration there were professors of law at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, as Gerardus Pomadellus (c. 1165), afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>; furthermore, his predecessor, Bishop Carzo, was called <em>sacrorum canonum doctor</em>. The contract proposed by the commune of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> to the Rectors of the students of Padua in 1228 shows that besides both <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and dialectics, medicine and grammar were taught there. The students were divided into four nationalities: French, Italian, German, and Provencal. This contract stipulated that all or part of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (14 professors and sufficient students to occupy 500 houses) should be transferred to <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> for at least eight years. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, however, was not suspended on that account, as is evident from the Life of St. Antonio. But the tyranny of Ezzelino (1237-56) caused its decadence. From 1260 it revived under the commune which established the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the professors and students, and the salaries (300 lire for legists and 200 for canonists); the examinations were held before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who also granted teachers' licenses. In 1274 Padua had the decrees of the Council of Lyons, equal with the Universities of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna. In 1282, on account of certain communal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> threatened to deprive Padua of its Studium, but the commune relented, and the Studium acquired great renown, rivalling Bologna, especially in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. From the beginning of the fourteenth century the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine was also famous. The professors in this faculty introduced <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroism</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty was instituted by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> in 1363. In the same year the Collegium Tornacense was founded, the first of its kind in <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>. There were other institutes from 1390, as the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of St. Marco for six medical students, the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Cardinal Pileo (1420) for twenty (afterwards twelve) students.

<p>The professors of this first period included the jurisconsults, Alberto Galeotto, Guido Suzzara, Jacopo d'Arena, Riccardo Malombra, Albrado Ponte, Rolando Piazzola, Jacopo Belvisio, Bartol Saliceti, and the celebrated Baldo; the canonists, Ruffino and Jacopo da Piacenza, Lapoda Castiglionchio, and the canonist and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, <a href="../cathen/15739a.htm">Francesco Zabarella</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; in medicine, Bruno da Longoburgo, Pietro d'Albano, Dino del Garbo, Jacopo and Giovanni Dondi (also excellent mechanicians), Marcilio, Giovanni and Guglielmo Santa Sofia, Jacopo da Forl&egrave;, and Biagio Pelacani. Philosophy was often taught, as elsewhere, by professors of medicine, mostly averroists, like Petrus Aponensis and <a href="../cathen/10476b.htm">Mundinus</a>. The most distinguished <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who were not physicians were <a href="../cathen/15353b.htm">Pier Paolo Vergerio</a> (1349-1414), afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Capo d'Istria, a learned <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> and a student of antiquity; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Antonio Trombetta, a famous <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotist</a>. From the fifteenth century there were in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> two courses, one <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a>, with professors preferably <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotist</a>, with professors chiefly from the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. Famous in the beginning of the sixteenth century were the controversies between the averroist <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Achillini, and the Alexandrist, Pietro Pomponazzi. The doctrines of the latter (who had gone to Bologna), especially on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were opposed, among others, by Agostino Nifo, another professor of Philosophy at Padua. The <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> Girolamo Fracastoro taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> there.

<p>Among the professors of letters were: Rolandino, historian of Padua (thirteenth century), and Giovanni da Ravenna, friend of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> Gosparino Barzizi, Francisco Filelfo, Vittorino da Feltre, a distinguished pedagogical writer and educator, Lauro Quirino; the Greeks Demetrio Chalcocondylas, Alessandro Zenos, Nicolas Leonicos, Marino Becichem, Romolo Amasacus, and Nicolo Caliachius; Giovanni Fascolus, Francesco Robortellos, the historian Sigonius, the great French Latinist Marc. Ant. Mauretus, Justus Lipsius, and the great Latin lexicographers of the eighteenth century, Jacopus Faciolatus, and <a href="../cathen/06134a.htm">Egidio Forcellini</a>. Astronomy, or <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, was taught already in the fourteenth century. The most noted professors were in the fifteenth century, Georg Pearbach, and his disciple Johann M&uuml;ller, called Regiomontanus; in the sixteenth century, Giovanni Battista Capuano and <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo Galilei</a>, who also taught mechanics and other physical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Chief among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> was the French <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Hyacinthe Serry (1698), who introduced there the new method of basing <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> more on Scriptural and patristic arguments than on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculations, in which he encountered much opposition from the Conventual Fra Nicola Buico. Among the jurisconsults, after the closing of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (1509-17), were the canonist Menochius, Alciatus, Lancelotti, and Pancirolo, famous also for his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Roman antiquities.

<p>A characteristic of the University of Padua, even in the eighteenth century, was its internationalism, as seen from the list of professors about Facciolati; it was attended especially by Germans. When <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> passed under Austrian domination (1814) the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was transformed, like that of Pavia. At present it has the ordinary four faculties, besides a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of applied engineering and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of pharmacy and obstetrics. Various <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> institutes, bacteriological, physiological, hygienic, and pathological; chemical, physical and geodetic laboratories; an anthropological museum; a botanical garden; and an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory complete the equipment of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. It has 128 chairs, 68 professors, 20 paid, and 107 private, tutors. In 1906, there was established near the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> an institution for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> young men. University <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> is strictly governmental, and without it all professional possibilities are closed to young men. At some seats of learning, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Clubs were started to help them against the peril to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, but they failed. The small Pensionata, situated in the neighborhood of Padua, between the Basilica and the church of Sta. Juliana, was transformed into a large establishment. The students attend a weekly conference which treats of points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> affecting modern conditions of life and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>.
