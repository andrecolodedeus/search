<h1>University of Palermo</h1>  

<p>The Convent of St. Dominic of Palermo may be considered the nucleus of the future University of Palermo. In this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> instruction was given in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and philosophy, not only for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, but also for the public. In 1469 Father Tommaso Schifaldo gave lessons there in Latin Literature. A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> lecturer, Father Salvo Cassetta, had so large a following that he lectured in the public square; he was also well versed in mathematics. In 1553 the commune wished to have a medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and called upon the famous Gianfilippo Ingrassia. His lectures too were delivered at the Convent of St. Dominic. In 1555 the commune also engaged <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> professors of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, including the historian Fazello. The chair of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> was founded in 1556, and the first professor was Geo. Ant. de Contovo. At the end of the sixteenth century nothing more was heard of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> School. From 1591, philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> were taught in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> (founded in 1550). In 1599 the number of chairs was increased. The <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> had the right of conferring degrees in these two <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. The courses of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were well attended.

<p>In 1632 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Pietro <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, gave his patrimony to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> which was about to be established in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the order. The royal concession was obtained and furthermore a contention arose between the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, each of whom desired to be chancellor; this controversy hindered the formation of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> itself, that is, of the two other faculties, law and medicine. Courses in medicine were given until 1621 in the Spedale Grande (Academy of Anatomy) through the initiative of Dr. Baldassare Grassia. On the failure of this, another similar course began in 1645, in the house of Camillini, which course continued, supplemented by instruction in mathematics. On the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>, their college was entrusted to <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. In 1777 the Senate of Palermo began to erect a complete <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which was established 1779 with three chairs in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, four in law, six in medicine, seven in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. The great professors were <a href="../cathen/14213a.htm">Spedalieri</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Cari in law, Sergio in political economy, Father Bernardino d' Ugria and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Eutichio Barone the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, Maronglia in mathematics. In 1780 new chairs were added, and in the following year the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> acquired the right of conferring degrees. In 1805 it was enacted that the rectors should be taken from the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine Order</a> which furnished many renowned professors, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> Piazzi (1786). When the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a> was re-established, the academy had to change its place; but it was also in that year (1805) that the said academy took the name of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Among the professors we amy mention: Scina, Gorgone, Amari, Ugdulene, and the late Canizarro (1826-1910).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has the usual four faculties of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, medicine, letters, and philosophy and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, besides a practical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for engineers and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of pharmacy. It has also a botanical garden, a cabinet of physics, including chemistry, mineralogy, geology, physiology, and <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory, various clinics and an archaeological museum. The number of students in 1909 was 1535; regular professors, 68; special professors, 111. It supports 84 chairs, and more that 123 teachers.
