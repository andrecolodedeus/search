<h1>University of Paris</h1>  

<p><em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF PARIS</a>.
<h2>Origin and early organization</h2>

<p>Three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were especially famous at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the palatine or palace <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Notre-Dame, and that of Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve. The decline of royalty inevitably brought about the decline of the first. The other two, which were very old, like those of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, are only faintly outlined during the early centuries of their existence. The glory of the palatine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> doubtless eclipsed theirs, until in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it completely gave way to them. These two centres were much frequented and many of their masters were esteemed for their learning. It is not until the tenth century, however, that we meet with a professor of renown in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve. This was Hubold, who, not content with the courses at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, came to continue his studies at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve, and by his teaching attracted many pupils. Recalled by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, he soon profited by a second journey to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to give lessons with no less success. As to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Notre-Dame, while many of its masters are mentioned simply as having been professors at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in its later history we meet with a number of distinguished names: in the eleventh century, Lambert, disciple of Filbert of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>; Drogo of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Manegold of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; <a href="../cathen/01550b.htm">Anselm of Laon</a>. These two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, attracting scholars from every country, produced many illustrious men, among whom were: St. Stanislaus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>; Gebbard, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>; St. Stephen, third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>; <a href="../cathen/13096a.htm">Robert d'Arbrissel</a>, founder of the Abbey of Fontevrault etc. The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of having formed similar pupils is indiscriminately ascribed to Notre-Dame and to Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve, as du Molinet has justly remarked (Bibl. Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>H. fr. 21, in fol., p. 576). Humanistic instruction comprised grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> (<em>trivium</em> and <em>quadrivium</em>). To the higher instruction belonged dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, whose source was the Scriptures and the Fathers, and which was completed by the study of canon law. Three men were to add a new splendour to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Notre-Dame and Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve, namely <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. A new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> arose which rivalled those of Notre-Dame and Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve. It owed its foundation to the same <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a> when he withdrew to the Abbey of St-Victor and it took the name of that <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Two men shed special radiance on this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Hugh and Richard, who added to their own names that of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at which they were religious and professors.

<p>The plan of studies expanded in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> as it did elsewhere. The great work of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Bologna, known as the "Decretum Gratiani", brought about a division of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Hitherto the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> had not been separate from <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> properly so-called; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was naturally undertaken first at Bologna, where <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> was taught. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, first Orl&eacute;ans and then <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> erected chairs of canon law, which except at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were usually also chairs of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. The capital of the kingdom might thus boast of this new professorate, that of the "Decretum Gratiani", to which before the end of the twelfth century were added the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gerard (or Girard) La Pucelle, Mathieu d'Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> was not included. In the course of the twelfth century also medicine began to be publicly taught at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. A professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> is mentioned in this city at this time, namely Hugo, "physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit", and it is to be assumed that this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> was included in his teaching.

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to teach, two things were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and appointment. Knowledge was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by examination, the appointment came from the examiner himself, who was the head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and was known as <em>scholasticus, capiscol</em>, and eventually as "chancellor". This was called the licence or faculty to teach. Without this authorization there was danger of the chairs being occupied by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> depicts as "children yesterday, masters today; yesterday receiving strokes of the ferrule, today teaching in a long gown" (Metalogicus, I, xxv <em>in init</em>.). The licence had to be granted gratuitously. Without it no one could teach; on the other hand, it could not be refused when the applicant deserved it.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St-Victor, which shared the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, conferred the licence in its own right; the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Notre-Dame depended on the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, that of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve on the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> or chapter. It was the diocese and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> or chapter which through their chancellor gave professorial investiture in their respective territories, i.e. the diocese in the city <em>intra pontes</em> and other places subject to the ordinary, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> or chapter on the left bank of the river as far as its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> reached. Consequently, as du Molinet explains, it was incumbent on the chancellor of Notre-Dame and Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve to examine "those who applied to teach in the schools", to "license after study those who sought to be masters and regents" (op. cit., 585). Besides these three centres of learning there were several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> on the "Island" and on the "Mount". "Whoever", says Crevier "had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to teach might open a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>". Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his "near the Petit Pont"; another Adam, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> by birth, "taught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change" (Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris, I, 272).



<p>The number of students in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the capital grew constantly, so that eventually the lodgings were insufficient. Among the French students there were princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and the most distinguished youths of the kingdom. The courses at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were considered so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. <a href="../cathen/03478a.htm">Popes Celestine II</a> and <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> had studied at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> sent his nephews there, and, under the name of Lothaire, a scion of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Seigny, who was later to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, belonged to the student body. <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freisingen</a>, Cardinal Conrad, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> were among the most illustrious sons of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; while Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve became practically the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The chroniclers of the time call <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the city of letters <em>par excellence</em>, placing it above Athens, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and other cities: "At that time", we read in the "Chroniques de St-Denis", "there flourished at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or elsewhere in the world" ("Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste"). Poets said the same thing in their verses, and they compared it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.

<p>To maintain order among the students and define the relations of the professors, organization was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. It had its beginnings, and it developed as circumstances permitted or required. Three features in this organization may be noted: first, the professors formed an association, for according to <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a>, John of Celles, twenty-first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was admitted as a member of the teaching corps of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> after he had followed the courses (Vita Joannis I, XXI, abbat. S. Alban). Again, the masters as well as the students were divided according to provinces, for as the same historian states, Henry II, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in his difficulties with <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>, wished to submit his cause to a tribunal composed of professors of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, chosen from various provinces (Hist. major, Henry II, to end of 1169). This was probably the germ of that division according to "nations" which was later to play an important part in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Lastly, mention must be made of the privileges then enjoyed by the professors and students. In virtue of a decision of <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>, they were amenable only to the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>. Other decisions dispensed them from residence in case they possessed <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and permitted them to receive their revenues.

<p>These three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Notre-Dame, Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve, and St-Victor may be regarded as the triple cradle of the <em>Universitas scholarium</em>, which included masters and students; hence the name University. Such is the common and more probable opinion. <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> and some others hold that this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> must be reserved to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes St-Victor because, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and the religious of St-Victor, <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was in large part founded about 1208, as is shown by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of St-Victor might well have furnished their contingent towards its formation. Secondly, <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> excludes the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. Now this is far from <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and moreover, it seems incontestable that <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> also had never ceased to be taught, which is sufficient for our point. Besides, the r&ocirc;le of the chancellor of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> cannot be explained by the new opinion; he continued to give degrees in arts, a function which would have ceased for him when the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was organized if his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> had no share in its organization. And while the name <em>Universitas scholarium</em> is quite intelligible on the basis of the common opinion, it is incompatible with the recent (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle's</a>) view, according to which there would have been <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>.
<h2>Organization in the thirteenth century</h2>

<p>As completing the work of organization the diploma of <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Robert de Cour&ccedil;on are worthy of note. The king's diploma was given "for the security of the scholars of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>", and in virtue of it from the year 1200 the students were subject only to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, and if in exceptional cases this was done it was only to hand over the culprit to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, for in the event of grave crime royal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was limited to taking cognizance of the procedure and the verdict. In no case could the king's officers lay hands on the head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> or even on a simple regent, this being allowed only in virtue of a mandate proceeding from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a> are later by some years, bearing the date 1215. They had for their object the moral or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> part of the instruction. They dealt with three principal points, the conditions of the professorate, the matter to be treated, and the granting of the licence. To teach the arts it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have reached the age of twenty-one, after having studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. For a chair in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> the candidate had to be thirty years of age with eight years of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, of which the last three years were at the same time devoted to special courses of lectures in preparation for the mastership. These studies had to be made in the local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and under the direction of a master, for at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> one was not regarded as a scholar unless he had a particular master. Lastly, purity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> was not less requisite than learning. Priscian's "Grammar", <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Dialectics", mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, music, certain books of rhetoric and philosophy were the subjects taught in the arts course; to these might be added the Ethics of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Stagyrite</a> and the fourth book of the Topics. But it was forbidden to read the books of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> on Metaphysics and Physics, or abbreviations of them. The licence was granted, according to custom, gratuitously, without <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> or condition. Masters and students were permitted to unite, even by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, in defence of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, when they could not otherwise obtain <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in serious matters. No mention is made either of law or of medicine, probably because these <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> were less prominent.

<p>A denial of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by the queen brought about in 1229 a suspension of the courses. Appeal was taken to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who intervened in the same year by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> which began with a eulogy of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. "Paris", said <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, "mother of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters". He compared it to a laboratory in which wisdom tested the metals which she found there, gold and silver to adorn the Spouse of Jesus Christ, iron to fashion the spiritual sword which should smite the inimical powers. He commissioned the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> and Senlis and the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The year 1230 came to an end without any result, and <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> took the matter directly in hand by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1231 addressed to the masters and scholars of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Not content with settling the dispute and giving guarantees for the future, he sanctioned and developed the concessions of Robert de Cour on by empowering the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to frame <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> concerning the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students. What was chiefly important was that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> recognized in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> or granted it the right, in case <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> were denied it, to suspend its courses until it should receive full satisfaction. It must be borne in mind that in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> not only was the granting of licence gratuitous but instruction also was free. This was the general rule; however, it was often <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to depart from it. Thus Pierre Le Mangeur was authorized by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to levy a moderate fee for the conferring of the licence. Similar fees were exacted for the first degree in arts and letters, and the scholars were taxed two <em>sous</em> weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. The office was elective and of short duration. At first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, rightly judging that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations. The "Nations" appeared in the second half of the twelfth century; they were mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> in 1222 and in another of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in 1231; later they formed a distinct body. In 1249 the four nations existed with their procurators, their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries; and in 1254, in the heat of the controversy between the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, a letter was addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> bearing the seals of the four nations. These were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years' War the English nation was replaced by the Germanic or German. The four nations constituted the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts or letters</a>. The expression faculty, though of ancient usage, did not have in the beginning its present meaning; it then indicated a branch of instruction. it is especially in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> that it is used to designate the professional body, and it may have had the same meaning in a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> Act of 1221 (cf. "Hist. Universitatis Parisiensis", III, 106).

<p>If the natural division of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> into nations arose from the native countries of the students, the classification of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must quite as naturally have introduced the division into faculties. Professors of the same <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> were brought into closer contact; community of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and interests cemented the union and made of them distinct groups, which at the same time remained integral parts of the teaching body. Thus the faculties gradually arose and consequently no precise account of their origin can be given. The faculty of medicine would seem to be the last in point of time. But the four faculties were already formally designated in a letter addressed in Feb., 1254, by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, wherein mention is made of "theology, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, medicine, and rational, natural, and moral philosophy". In the celebrated <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quasi Lignum" (April, 1255), <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> speaks of "the faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>" of other "faculties", namely those of canonists, physicians, and artists. If the masters in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> set the example in this special organization, those in <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> and medicine hastened to follow it. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the seals which the last-named adopted some years later, as the masters in arts had already done.

<p>The faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or canon law, and medicine, were called "superior faculties". The title of "dean" as designating the head of a faculty, was not in use until the second half of the thirteenth century. In this matter the faculties of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> and medicine seem to have taken the lead, which the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> followed, for in authentic acts of 1268 we read of the deans of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> and medicine, while the dean of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> is not mentioned until 1296. It would seem that at first the deans were the oldest masters. The <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> continued to have four procurators of its four nations and its head was the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. As the faculties became more fully organized, the division into four nations partially disappeared for <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> and medicine, while it continued in arts. Eventually the superior faculties were to include only <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, leaving the bachelors to the nations. At this period, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had two principal degrees, the baccalaureate and the doctorate. It was not until much later that the licentiate, while retaining its early character, became an intermediate degree: Besides, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> numbered among its members beadles and messengers, who also performed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of clerks.

<p>The scattered condition of the scholars in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> often made the question of lodging difficult. Recourse was had to the townsfolk, who exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. Hence arose friction and quarrels, which, as the scholars were very numerous, would have developed into a sort of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> if a remedy had not been found. The remedy sought was taxation. This right of taxation, included in the regulation of Robert de Cour&ccedil;on, had passed on to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. It was upheld in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> of 1231, but with an important modification, for its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. These circumstances had long shown the need of new arrangements. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. The result was the foundation of the colleges (<em>colligere</em>, to assemble). This measure also furthered the progress of studies by a better employment of time, under the guidance sometimes of resident masters and out of the way of dissipation. These colleges were not usually centres of instruction, but simple boarding-houses for the students, who went from them to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Each had a special object, being established for students of the same nationality or the same <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Four colleges appear in the twelfth century; they became more numerous in the thirteenth, and among them may be mentioned Harcourt and the Sorbonne. Thus the University of Paris, which in general was the type of the other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, had already assumed the form which it afterwards retained. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a>, and the three superior faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and medicine. Ecclesiastical dignities, even abroad, seemed reserved for the masters and students of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. This preference became a general rule, and eventually a right, that of eligibility to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Such was the origin and early organization of the University of Paris which might even then, in virtue of their protection, call itself the daughter of kings, but which was in reality the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. St. Louis, in the diploma which he granted to the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> for their establishment near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, speaks of this city, where "flow the most abundant waters of wholesome <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, so that they become a great river which after refreshing the city itself irrigates the Universal Church". <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> uses a no less charming comparison: "the noble and renowned city, the city which is the source of learning and sheds over the world a light which seems an image of the celestial splendour; those who are taught there shine brilliantly, and those who teach there will shine with the stars for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>" (cf. <a href="../cathen/02714a.htm">du Boulay</a>, "Hist. Univers. Paris", III, 360-71).
<h2>Later history</h2>

<p>Abuses crept in; to correct these and to introduce various needed modifications in the work of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was the purpose of the reform carried out in the fifteenth century by Cardinal d'Estouteville, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. As a whole it was less an innovation than a recall to the better observance of the ancient <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. The reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government, was of the same character with regard to the three superior faculties. As to the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a>, the study of Greek was added to that of Latin, only the best classical authors were recommended; the French poets and orators were used along with Hesiod, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition to teach <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> was never well observed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. But in 1679 <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> authorized the teaching of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>. As a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> consequence the name "faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>" replaced that of "faculty of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>". The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years' War was fatal to these establishments, but the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> set about remedying the injury.

<p>Remarkable for its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part: in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and deplorable divisions; in the State, during national crises; and if under the domination of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it dishonoured itself in the trial of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>, it rehabilitated itself by rehabilitating the heroine herself. Proud of its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges, it fought energetically to maintain them. Hence the long struggle against the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the conflict, shorter but also memorable, against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made liberal use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and in its own name pronounced condemnation, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>.

<p>Its patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was given over to factions, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> sought energetically to restore peace; and under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> had crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king's disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, "Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris au XVII<sup>e</sup> et XVIII<sup>e</sup> si&egrave;cle", 132-34; "Archiv. du minist&egrave;re de l'instruction publique").

<p>The ancient <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was to disappear with ancient <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. On 15 Sept., 1793, petitioned by the Department of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and several departmental groups, the National Convention decided that independently of the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, already the objects of its solicitude, "there should be established in the Republic three progressive degrees of instruction; the first for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> indispensable to artisans and workmen of all kinds; the second for further <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to those intending to embrace the other professions of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; and the third for those branches of instruction the study of which is not within the reach of all men". Measures were to be taken immediately: "For means of execution the department and the municipality of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> are authorized to consult with the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, in order that these establishments shall be put in action by 1 November next, and consequently colleges now in operation and the faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, medicine, arts, and law are suppressed throughout the Republic". This was the death-sentence of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. It was not to be restored after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> had subsided, any more than those of the provinces. All were replaced by a single centre, viz., the University of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The lapse of a century brought the recognition that the new system was less favourable to study, and it was sought to restore the old system, but without the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.
