<h1>University of Pisa</h1>  

<p>In the eleventh century there were many jurisconsults at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> who lectured on law; prominent among them were Opitone and Sigerdo. There also was preserved a codex of the <a href="../cathen/11439a.htm">Pandects</a>, dated, it was said, from Justinian. Four professors of the Law School of Bologna, Bulgarus, Burgundius, Uguccione, and Bandino, successors of <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius</a>, were trained here; Burgundius acquired renown by his translation of the <a href="../cathen/11439a.htm">Pandects</a> and of Greek works on medicine. Gerardo de Fasiano, Lambertuccio Arminzochi, Zacchia da Volterra, Giovanni Fagioli, Ugo Benci, Baldo da Forli, and Giovanni d'Andrea taught at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> in the thirteenth century. In the same century medicine also was taught; the most famous professor was Guido of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, who afterwards went to Bologna (1278). In 1338, as <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> had placed Bologna under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, Ranieri da Forli and Bartolo removed to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> with a large following. The <em>Studium</em> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> is mentioned in the communal documents of 1340. In 1343 <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> erected a <em>studium generale</em>, with all the faculties, including <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; and Charles IV confirmed it in 1355.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, however, did not flourish. From 1359 to 1364 it was closed, and was only reopened by <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>. Meantime, however, the teaching of law was not discontinued. In 1406 <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> fell into the power of the Florentines who suppressed the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1473 Lorenzo de' Medici with <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV's</a> approval closed the University of Florence and reopened <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. For its endowment the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were put under contribution to such an extent that <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> in 1534 recalled the concessions of his predecessors. The most celebrated teachers of this first epoch were the jurisconsults Francesco Tigrini, Baldo degli Ubaldi, Lancellotto Decio, Francesco Alcolti, Baldo Bartolini, Giasone del Maino, Bartolommeo and Mariano Socini; the physicians, Guido da Prato, Ammanati, Ugolino da Montecatini, Alessandro Sermoneta, Albertino da Cremona, Pietro Leoni, and Cristoforo Prati; the Humanists, Bartolommeo da Pratorecchi, Lorenzo Lippi, Andrea Dati, Mariano Tucci; the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, Bernardino Cherichini (1478) and Giorgio Benigni Salviati.

<p>In 1543 Cosimo de' Medici undertook to restore the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and to this end <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> made large concessions out of the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Several colleges were founded, such as the Ducal College, the Ferdinando, and the Puteano (Pozzi for the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a>). The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at this time became famous especially by its cultivation of the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Among its noted scientists were: Cesalpino (botany, medicine, philosophy); <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo Galilei</a> (mathematics and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>); Borelli (mechanics and medicine); Luca Ghini, first director of the botanical gardens (1544); Andrea Vesalio, Realdo Colombo, <a href="../cathen/05772a.htm">Gabriele Falloppo</a>; Giovanni Risischi, and Lambeccari in <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>; Baccio Baldini, Vidio Vidi, Girolamo Mercuriale, Rodrigo Fonseca (seventeenth century), Fil. Cavriami, Marcello Malpighi in medicine. In view of its progressive spirit, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> may be called the cradle of modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The professors of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> were rather conservative, but there were not wanting able thinkers, such as the two Torellis, Francesco Vegio, Asinio, Giacomo Mandelli, the two Facchinis, and the Scotsman <a href="../cathen/04717a.htm">Dempster</a>; Nicola Bonaparte, who introduced into <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> the critical-historical study of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a> inaugurated by Cujas, Giuseppe Averani, Stefano Fabrucci, historian of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, <a href="../cathen/14446a.htm">Bernardo Tanucci</a>, afterwards minister of Charles III of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>.

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was again in a precarious condition; but the new Lorenzian dynasty sought to strengthen it by increasing the scientific institutes, and revising the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>; thus after 1744 the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was no longer elected by the scholars or from their ranks, but had to be one of the professors. In the eighteenth century Valsecchi and Berti won distinction in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; Andrea Guadegni, Bart. Franc. Pellegrini, Migliorotto Maccioni, Flaminio Dal Borgo, Gian Maria Lampredi, Sandonnini (canonist), the criminalists della Pura and Ranuccia in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>; Politi, Corsini, Antonioli, Sarti in letters; Guido Grandi, Claudio Fromond, Anton Nicola Branchi, Lorenzo Pignotti, Lorenzo Tilli, and Giorgio Santi in natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>; Angelo Gatti, Antonio Matani, Franc. Torrigiani in medicine; Brogiani and Berlinghieri in <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>. In 1808 the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were introduced, but were superseded by others in 1814. The professors were then divided into the faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, law (comprising philosophy and literature), and medicine. But the number of the chairs increased; in 1840 there were six faculties. In 1847 the "Annali delle Universit&agrave; toscane" were published.

<p>In 1851, for political reasons, the Universities of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> were united, the faculties of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> located at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and those of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and medicine at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. The former regime was re-established in 1859 with such modifications as the Law of Casati required. In 1873 all chairs of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> were suppressed throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Noted professors in law were Lorenzo Quartieri, Federico del Rosso, Valeri, Poggi, Salvagnoli, Franc. <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, P. Emilio Imbriani, and Franc. Carrara (criminalist). Science and letters were represented by the <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a> Gerbi; the chemist Piria; the mathematician Betti; the physicians Puccinotti, Pacini, Marcacci, Ranzi (pathology); the criminalist Rosellini, the Latinist Ferrucci; and Francesco de Sanctis, literary critic. Besides the usual faculties, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> has <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of engineering, agriculture, veterinary medicine and pharmacy, and a normal high school. In 1910-11 there were 159 instructors and 1160 students.
