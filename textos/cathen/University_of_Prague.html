<h1>University of Prague</h1>  

<p>The University of Prague was founded by Charles IV with the consent of the Estates on the model of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna and confirmed at the emperor's request by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> as a <em>studium generale</em>. It was established by the Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 7 April, 1345, and received imperial sanction 14 September, 1349 Archbishop Ernst of Pard&uuml;bitz took an active part in the foundation by <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to contribute. Its official title is "Imperial and Royal Franz Ferdinand University"; at the present time it is divided into two completely separated <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, one German and the other <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> or Czech, each having four faculties (namely, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and medicine), each its own <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and four deans. Both <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> are national and are under the immediate control of the Imperial and Royal Ministry of Education at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. All professors are appointed by the State, even the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> professors; these latter are appointed in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, who is chancellor of both <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>From the time of its founding the University of Prague was equipped with four faculties, of which each came gradually to elect its dean for one half-year, and jointly the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, at first for a year, then later for a half-year. On account of a dispute about an inheritance the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> separated from the rest of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in April, 1372, and from that time on, with the consent of the king, formed what might be called an independent <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> under the direction of a dean of its own; the chancellor was the only official whose authority extended to all the faculties; this office was held in perpetuity by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>. The list of matriculations from 1372 to 1418 of the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is still in existence. The lectures were held in the colleges, of which the oldest was the Carolinum. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Carolinum still stands and serves as the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of giving degrees. Theological instruction was given in the Carolinum and in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. For the administration of its affairs the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was divided into four "nations", according to the native land of the teachers and students, namely: the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, including <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravians</a>, southern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, and Hungarians; the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, including Austrians, Swabians, natives of Franconia and of the Rhine provinces; the Polish, including Silesians, Poles, Russians; the Saxon, including inhabitants of the Margravate of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, Upper and Lower Saxony, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and Sweden. Each nation had a vote in all deliberations regarding the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. This was changed in 1409.

<p>Although in 1403 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had forbidden its members to follow the teachings of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, yet his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> constantly gained adherents in the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> nation, the most conspicuous being the magister, Jerome of Prague, and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a>. The latter had translated <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif's</a> "Trialogus" into Czech. In 1401-02 <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> had been dean of the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a>, in 1402-03 <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; he had also been an exceedingly popular preacher at the Bethlehem <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The majority of the other three nations of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had declared themselves, together with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, on the side of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, to whom King Wenceslaus IV was opposed, and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to make use of the king's displeasure at this to obtain from him what is called the "Kuttenberg <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a>" of 18 January, 1409. This gave the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> nation three votes in all the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and only one vote to all the other nations together; the result of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was the emigration of the German professors and students to Leipzig in May, 1409. In 1408 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had about 200 <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and magisters, 500 bachelors, and 30,000 students; it now lost a large part of this number, accounts of the loss varying from 5000 to 20,000 including 46 professors. This was the beginning of the decline of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, from now on a national <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> institution, which sank to a very low status. For the faithfulness of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus's</a> opponents led to a far-reaching division between the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and the secular faculties, as the latter held firmly to his teachings even after he was burnt by the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1414). The <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> became a centre of the Hussite movement, and the chief <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority of the Utraquists.

<p>On account of the part taken by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in ecclesiastico-political affairs, its position as a centre of learning suffered. No degrees were given in the years 1417-30; at times there were only eight or nine professors, as in 1419 the faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and law disappeared, and only the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> remained in existence. There were also very few students, for many were unwilling to study under the Calixtine faculties and therefore went into foreign countries. The holdings of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> were taken by the Emperor Sigismund as his personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Under the impulse of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> some progress was made by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty when the Emperor Rudolf II (1612) took up his residence in <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, but it did not last long. The only thing to the credit of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was what it did in directing the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system of the country. In the meantime the Emperor Ferdinand I had called the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, in 1556, and these had opened an academy near St. Clement's, the imperial letter of foundation being <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1562. This academy comprised a <em>gymnasium</em> of six classes as well as an institute for teaching <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and philosophy arranged according to the <a href="../cathen/12654a.htm">"Plan of Study" (<em>Ratio studiorum</em>)</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. At first there was only one teacher for each of the two departments of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In addition, a large college was built near St. Clement's, which on this account was called the Clementina, or, after its founder, the Ferdinandea. The right of giving degrees, which it received from the emperor in 1562, was sharply contested by the old <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, the Carolina.



<p>After the battle of the White Mountain, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who had been expelled in the years 1618-21, came to have a predominant influence over the emperor in matters concerning instruction on account of their "Plan of study", and the great work they did for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. An imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 19 September, 1622, gave them the supreme control of the entire <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, and Silesia. In November of the same year, after the resignation of the remaining four professors, they were also given control of the Carolina together with nine colleges, and all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and revenues of these, so that whoever was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was the future <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Carolo-Ferdinandea. The right of giving degrees, of holding the chancellorship, and of appointing the secular professors was also granted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Cardinal Ernst, Count von Harrach, who opposed this union of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with another institution and the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> right to the chancellorship, prevented the drawing-up of the imperial Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> for the confirmation of these grants. He also founded an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of his own, the Collegium Adalbertinum, in order to secure his influence over the students in training for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. In 1638 Ferdinand III limited the monopoly of teaching enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> by taking from them the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, properties, and archives of the Carolina, the faculties of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine, and making these once more independent under an imperial protector. During the last year of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> the Karls Bridge of Prague was <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> defended against the Swedes by the students of the Carolina and Clementina under the leadership of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> George Plach&yacute;. After this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> received its permanent constitution and by a formal <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> (4 March, 1654) the Carolo-Ferdinandea was again united and placed under a chancellor, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, and an imperial superintendent. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> retained all the professorships in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties up to 1757, when a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and an Augustinian were also appointed to give <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> instruction. In the two secular faculties the number of lay professors increased after the abolition, in 1612, of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> of the professors. The secular professors were appointed by the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> professors were merely presented to him. They held closely to the <em><a href="../cathen/12654a.htm">Ratio studiorum</a></em> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> and, in regard to discipline and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, they were entirely their own masters. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty had four regular professorships; that of law, four to six; the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, three to five; the medical, five.

<p>The dilapidated Carolinum was rebuilt in 1718 by Max Kanka at the expense of the State. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was strictly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>: the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that had to be made on receiving a degree before the chancellor, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, excluded non-Catholics from the professorships; the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> granted the degrees for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chancellor (<em>pro cancellario</em>). The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> prescribed that the whole teaching corps should receive Communion on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> and (after 1602) should take part as a body in the <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> procession. From 1650 those who received degrees took an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to maintain the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin as long as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> did not decide against it, and this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was annually renewed on 8 December by all the <em>cives academici</em>. Such, on the whole, was the status which continued until the bureaucratic reform of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1752 and 1754. This reform deprived the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of many of their corporate <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and rectors appointed by the State were placed at the head of the faculties; as neither the rectors nor the deans so appointed were professors, the Senate was little more than an ornamental body. Matters remained thus until 1849. A great change was brought about in the entire <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> in 1773: <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> now received positions in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were appointed to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty. In 1781 the prevailing Josephinism opened academic offices to non-Catholics, and this was followed, in 1785, by the appointment of the first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as professor in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty; in 1781 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were permitted to study at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in 1790 they were allowed to receive degrees. The <em>juramentum de Immaculata Conceptione</em> and the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on receiving a degree were dropped in 1782. The new regulations concerning studies (1784) increased the number of professorships and teaching positions in all the faculties; German was made the language of instruction, only pastoral theology and obstetrics were taught in Czech. In 1784 the professors dropped the dress peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which has been retained to the present only by the five proctors, the upper proctor and the proctors for the four faculties. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was completely under the guardianship of the state, which prescribed the text-books, themes for disputation, semi-annual examinations and fees; in making all these changes, practical training was kept in view. It was not until the revolutionary year of 1848 in which the students of the University of Prague took up arms that a radical change was made.

<p>The "regulation respecting study" of 1 October, 1850, is based upon freedom of teaching and learning. By this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and that "concerning the organization of academic boards of control" the early autonomy of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with its independent election of rectors and deans was restored. The religious limitations upon academic degrees and positions were to be entirely removed; although as late as 1863 a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> elected dean of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty failed of confirmation by the State. Since that time the election of non-Catholics as deans and rectors has been of common occurrence. <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, also, have held the office of dean, but not, so far, that of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, two who were elected having declined the position. Great difficulties have arisen from the national conditions. One indication of the constitutional tendency was a constant development of the national and political consciousness of the Czech majority of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> people. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> recognized this to a limited degree by founding parallel Czech professorships. Thus, in 1863, out of 187 lecture courses 22 were in Czech; the number was increased but even this did not satisfy the Czechs. Consequently, after long negotiations, the Carolo-Ferdinandea was divided into a German and a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Karl-Ferdinand University, by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 28 February, 1882. The academic authorities and institutions of each section are entirely independent of the other section; only the <em>aula</em> in the Carolinum and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> are in common. The separation came into effect in the winter semester of 1882-83, but it did not include the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, where lectures are generally given in Latin, on account of the opposition of Cardinal Schwarzenburg. Under Schwarzenburg's successor, Cardinal Count Sch&ouml;nborn, this faculty was also divided in the winter semester of 1891-2, while the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> remained mixed in nationality. The sum of 93,000 kronen is required for the maintenance of the 150 students of this <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> &mdash; i.e. about 620 kronen apiece (a krone is twenty cents). Of this amount 32,043 kronen come from the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; the rest is granted by the State. The separation and the constantly increasing needs of the work of teaching make new buildings <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Two new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> buildings to replace the inadequate Carolinum are in course of construction.
<h2 id="section2">Present condition</h2>

<p>In the winter semester of 1909-10 the German Karl-Ferdinand University had 1778 students; these were divided into: 58 <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students, for both the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; 755 law students; 376 medical; 589 <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>. Among the students were about 80 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The professors were divided as follows: <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, 7 regular professors, 1 assistant professor, 1 docent; law, 12 regular professors, 2 assistant professors, 4 docents; medicine, 15 regular professors, 19 assistant, 30 docents; philosophy, 30 regular professors, 8 assistant, 19 docents, 7 lecturers. The budget for the year (not including building expenses) was: 1,612,246 kronen ($322,450) for regular expenses, 94,534 kronen for extraordinary expenses. The student associations, copied from those in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, are highly developed. The principal ones are: the "Reading and Debating Club of the German Students" founded in 1848, with about 500 members; the "Germania", founded in 1892, with 600 members (both Liberal associations); the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> association, "Academia", founded in 1909, with over a hundred members. In the face of over twenty student corps which have colours of their own and favour <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duelling</a>, the three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> corps with about a hundred active members have a difficult position; yet they continually increase in number. In aid of the students there is a German students' home with a hundred rooms and a students' commons. The <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Karl-Ferdinand University in the winter semester of 1909-10 included 4319 students; of these 131 were <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students belonging both to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; 1962 law students; 687 medical; 1539 <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>; 256 students were <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The professors were divided as follows: <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, 8 regular professors, 2 docents; law, 12 regular, 7 assistant professors, 12 docents; medicine, 16 regular professors, 22 assistant, 24 docents; philosophy, 29 regular, 16 assistant, 35 docents, 11 lecturers. The annual budget amounts to 1,763,790 kronen ($352,758) for regular expenditures, and 117,760 kronen for extraordinary expenditures, without including building expenses. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty is temporarily housed in a private residence. The "Academic Reading Society" (Akademick&yacute; cten&aacute;rsk&yacute; spolek) is Liberal in religion, the "Svaz cesko-slovanas-k&eacute;ho studentstva" is more radical still. In comparison with these the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations are comparatively weak. They are: "Druzstvo Arnosta z Pardubie" (100 to 200 members), "Ceska akademicka Liga", and the Slavonic "Dan". In addition to the Hlaska house of studies for students, there is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> home for students founded by Ernst von Pard&uuml;bitz. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> common to both <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and to which the public is also admitted, contains 375,630 volumes; among these are 3921 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and 1523 early printed books. The expenses of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> for 1910 were 178,509 kronen ($35,702).
