<h1>University of Rostock</h1>  

<p>Located in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, founded in the year 1419 through the united efforts of Dukes John IV and Albert V, and on 13 February of the same year granted a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of foundation by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a>. At first the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> included only the three secular faculties; in 1432 a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty was added with the approval of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Schwerin was appointed chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; his present successors are the Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg. The majority of the professors came from Erfurt, among them the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, Petrus Stenbeke. The city of Rostock endowed the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> most generously with lands, as did the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Schwerin, who presented his house at Rostock as a residence. At a later date it received contributions from <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> and Lubeck. In 1427 it obtained from <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> a unique privilege, allowing the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> in conjunction with several <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> to bestow a degree if the chancellor refused without a valid reason to grant it. When Rostock was placed under the bann of the empire and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on account of outbreaks among the citizens, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> moved to Greifswald (<a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1437). In 1443 it returned to Rostock, but when the dukes wished to raise one of the churches of the city to a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>-church in order to give the professors the <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> as <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, the town opposed the procedure and there developed what is known as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> feud. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> migrated temporarily in the summer of 1487 to Wismar and then to Lubeck. It fell into complete decay after the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in (1523) when the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> revenues were lost and matriculations ceased. When an effort was made later to reorganize the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> a dispute arose between the city of Rostock and the dukes of <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a> as to the administration and supervision of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In 1563 the agreement called the "Formula concordiae", was made between the contending parties, which granted nearly equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to both. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> now enjoyed an era of prosperity. In 1758 Duke Frederick desired the appointment of a rigidly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> professor, but the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty opposed him; whereupon the duke obtained an imperial patent for the founding of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at Butzow which was opened in 1760. The two <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> proving too expensive for the country, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Butzow was closed and united with Rostock in 1789. In 1829 the town council renounced its right of co-patronage. During the second half of the nineteenth century the University began steadily to develop and gain, so that in 1911 it had about 800 students.
