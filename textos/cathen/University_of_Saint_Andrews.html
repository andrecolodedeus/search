<h1>University of Saint Andrews</h1>  

<p>The germ of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is to be found in an association of learned <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, formed in 1410, among whom were: Laurence of Lindores, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Scone, Richard Cornwall, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Lothian, Wm. Stephen, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Dunblane. They offered courses of lectures in divinity, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. Henry Wardlaw, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Andrews, granted a charter of privilege in 1411; he sought a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of foundation from the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> he was and whose claims <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> supported. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was granted in 1413; it was confirmed by royal charter of James I in 1532. The five-hundredth anniversary of the foundation was celebrated in 1911. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> consisted of three colleges: St. Salvator's, founded in 1450 by Bishop James Kennedy, confirmed and further privileged by Popes <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>; St. Leonard's, founded by Archbishop Stuart and Prior Hepburn in 1512; and St. Mary's, founded by <a href="../cathen/02374a.htm">Archbishop James Beaton</a>, under sanction of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, in 1537. This occupied the site of the original pedagogy. All the foundations were amply supported by successive endowment. The college buildings escaped when the churches of St. Andrews were demolished by the reformers, but it was not until 1574 that the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> began to recover. At the same time that Andrew Melville (a St. Andrews' student) was re-erecting the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, a commission, inspired by George Buchanan, began a series of reforms at St. Andrews, which intermittently continued throughout the seventeenth century. In 1747 St. Salvator's and St. Leonard's Colleges were united. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was further enlarged and strengthened by the affiliation in 1897 of University College, Dundee, at which the scientific departments are chiefly conducted. A proposal by the <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">Marquess of Bute</a> (<a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> 1892-98) to affiliate Blair's College, <a href="../cathen/01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a>, was unsuccessful. Among the famous professors and students in St. Andrews of the earlier period must be named John Major, Andrew Melville, <a href="../cathen/05143a.htm">Gavin Douglas</a>, George Buchanan, Patrick Forbes, Napier of Merchiston; its leaders and its <em>alumni</em>, played a great part in Scottish <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> politics of the seventeenth century, most notably Zachary Boyd, Wm. Carstares, principal of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, and Samuel Rutherford. During the last century St. Andrews can show a long list of distinguished scientists and men of letters. The total number of students (1909-10) was 571, of whom 247 were <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; University College, Dundee, contributed 214 of the total.
