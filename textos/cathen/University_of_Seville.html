<h1>University of Seville</h1>  

<p>In the middle of the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, in order to prepare missionaries for work among the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, organized <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the teaching of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek. To co-operate in this work and to enhance the prestige of Seville, Alfonso the Wise in 1254 established in that city "general <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>" (<em>escuelas generales</em>) of Arabic and Latin. <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 21 June, 1260, recognized this foundation as a <em>generale litterarum studium</em> and granted its members certain <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> in the matter of residence. Later, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter established <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies in the College of San Miguel. Rodrigo de Santaello, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and commonly known as Maese Rodrigo, began the construction of a building for a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1472; in 1502 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Majesties published the royal decree creating the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in 1505 <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> granted the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of authorization; in 1509 the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Maese Rodrigo was finally installed in its own building, under the name of Santa Mar&iacute;a de Jes&uacute;s, but its courses were not opened until 1516. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Majesties and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted the power to confer degrees in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. It should be noted that the <em>colegio mayor de Maese Rodrigo</em> and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> proper, although housed in the same building, never lost their several identities, as is shown by the fact that, in the eighteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was moved to the College of San Hermanegildo, while that of Maese Rodrigo remained independent, although languishing.

<p>The influence of the University of Seville, from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> point of view, though not equal to that of the Universities of Salamanca and of Alcal&aacute;, was nevertheless considerable. From its lecture halls came Sebasti&aacute;n Antonio de Cort&eacute;s, Riquelme, <a href="../cathen/16071a.htm">Rioja</a>, Luis Germ&aacute;n y Rimb&oacute;n, founder of the Horatian Academy, Juan S&aacute;nchez, professor of mathematics at San Telmo, Mart&iacute;n Alberto Carbajal, Cardinal Belluga, Cardinal Francisco Solis Folch, Marcelo Doye y Pelarte, Bernardo de Torrijos, Francisco Aguilar Ribon, the Abate Marchena, Alberto Lista, and many others who shone in the magistracy, or were distinguished <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. The influence of the University of Seville on the development of the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, was very great. In its shadow the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the famous master Juan de Mablara was founded, and intellects like those of <a href="../cathen/07295a.htm">Herrera</a>, Arquij&oacute;, and many others were developed, while there were formed literary and artistic clubs, like that of Pacheco, which was a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for both <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and poetry. During the period of secularization and sequestration (1845-57) the University of Seville passed into the control of the State and received a new organization. At present it comprises the faculties of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and letters, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and medicine, with an enrolment (1910) of 1100 students.

<p>At the same time that the royal <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was established, there was developed the <em>Universidad de Mareantes</em> (university of sea-farers), in which body the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Majesties, by a royal decree of 1503, established the <em>Casa de Contrataci&oacute;n</em> with classes of pilots and of seamen, and courses in cosmography, mathematics, military tactics, and artillery. This establishment was of incalculable importance, for it was there that the expeditions to the Indies were organized, and there that the great Spanish sailors were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. This species of polytechnic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which, according to Eden, Bourn&eacute;, and Humboldt, taught a great deal to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, following the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, fell into decay in the seventeenth century.
