<h1>University of Upsala</h1>  

<p>The oldest and most celebrated <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of Sweden. Even today the arrangement of its buildings in the city of Upsala (about 23,000 inhabitants) shows that it is the creation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The venerable Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which contains in a silver <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> the remains of St. Eric the King (d. 1161), is surrounded by the colleges, houses of the "nations", clinical <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, infirmaries, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory, and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The proposal to call foreign scholars to Upsala to give lectures is said to have been made at the church <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Arboga in 1417. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were commissioned by the Synod of S&ouml;derc&ouml;ping (1441) to take measures to obtain a <em>studium generale.</em> Shortly after this <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> sought to establish a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>. This led Archbishop Jakob Ulfsson, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> Church (470-1515), a man who did much for Sweden, to seek from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the privilege of founding a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In the summer of 1477 the envoy of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the royal council, Canon Ragvald Ingemundi, returned from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> bringing with him from <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus IV</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 February, 1477, granting the charter. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was to be modelled on that of Bologna, to have the same privileges and liberties, and to include the faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, medicine, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a> was to be the licentiate, doctor, and master. After receiving the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and his six suffragans, the administrator of the kingdom, Sten Sture I, and the twenty-three members of the royal council of Strengon 2 July, 1477. The lectures began in the autumn of the same year, and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> developed and flourished greatly.

<p>Religious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> appeared at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> during the rectorship of Laurentius Petri, who had studied at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> under <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and who, as the first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, introduced the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> into <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. In consequence of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was closed in 1580. Its place was taken, for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, by a <em>collegium regium</em>, at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>. where the instruction was given for a time by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1593 the University of Upsala was revived by order of the General Council of Sweden. Originally, it was only intended to have the faculties of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and philosophy, but the others were added later. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> also received its old privileges, so that it was able to maintain its independence until modern times, notwithstanding all the violent changes in the kingdom. Its second period of prosperity began during the reign of King Gustavus II Adolphus, who endowed it with his valuable landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professors of the eighteenth century was the well-known natural scientist Karl von Linn&aelig;us, who received the honorary title of <em>Botanicorum princeps.</em> In the nineteenth century the most distinguished professor was the historian and poet, Eric Gustav Geijer. The students are distributed, according to the district they come from, among the thirteen "nations", all of which, in the middle of the past century, united into one student body. As in other <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> institutions of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the organization and instruction are regulated by the royal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of 10 January, 1876. The presiding officer is a chancellor elected for three years by the council of professors and confirmed by the king; the substitute for the chancellor is the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. In the year 1911-12 there were 68 professors. 70 dozenten, and 2261 students.
