<h1>University of Valladolid</h1>  

<p>The name of the founder and the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of foundation of the University of Valladolid are not known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Its origin probably dates from 1260-64; in 1293 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was in a most flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Alfonso XI was the patron of Valladolid, just as Alfonso the Wise had been that of Salamanca. He provided a fixed revenue for the <em>estudios</em>, of one third the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> received from Valladolid and its surrounding hamlets, conferred many honours on its professors, and finally petitioned <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> for <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authorization, which was given in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 30 July, 1346. All the courses embraced by the great <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, including medicine and surgery, were installed, the latter branch being later separated and constituted a special course. According to Morej&oacute;n (see bibl.), medical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> substituted the system of Hippocrates for <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> methods much earlier than foreign writers have asserted. In 1513 the physician Barnadino <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> de Monserrata, in his book "Libro de la anatomia del hombre" (folio 3), said that to study surgery it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to go to either Montpelier, Bologna, or Valladolid. At Valladolid the lectures were so famous that <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> at the age of seventy was carried in a litter to hear the lectures of Prof. Alfonso Rodriguez de Guevara. The professor of surgery made twenty-five dissections in the general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> each term. The professor and students of botany went into the country to make a practical study of plant life. The influence of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was very great in both State and Church.

<p>From the catalogue of famous students in the "Historiade Valladolid" the following names are taken: Juan Auves, doctor of canon law, librarian of Santa Cruz, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ciudad (d. 1549); Antolinez de <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, first historian of the city; Augustin Antolinez, Augustinian, professor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and of that of Salamanca; Tom&aacute;s Arizmendi, counsellor of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>; Lorenzo Arrazola, chief counsellor of the Crown; Pedro Avila y Soto, professor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, counsellor of the Indies and of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, criminal prosecutor of the Crown, and counsellor of the army; Gaspar R. Bravo de Somonte, professor and physician to Philip IV and Charles II; Breton y Simancas, Bishop and Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; Pedro Cevallos, minister of Ferdinand VII; Agustin Esteban Collantes, minister of Isabella II; Dionisio Daza y Chac&oacute;n, distinguished physician who rendered valuable services at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> during the plague of 1564, was surgeon to Maximilian, the princess Dona Juana, physician of Don Carlos and Don Juan of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the battle of Alpujarra; Diego Escudero, compiler of the "Nueva Recopilaci&oacute;n"; Jos&eacute; Larra (Figaro), celebrated <em>litterateur</em>; Luis Mercado, prof., and physician to Philip II during the last twenty years of his life, an eminent writer greatly misunderstood by Sprengel; Claudio Moyano, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reformer, professor, and afterwards minister under Isabella II; Jos&eacute; Zorrilla, noted poet. The controversy between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> with regard to grace and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, which interested all the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, involved the University of Valladolid even more deeply, as Diego Alvarez, one of its professors, and Avenda&ntilde;o, both <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, opposed the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Molina. Of all the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders the Augustinians alone maintained an independent position. Their moderation contributed to dissipate much ill feeling aroused by the discussion. In 1770 certain royal privileges gave rise to heated controversy.

<p>The early days of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> were mostly unpretentious; it had only seven courses, the deplorable state of the times not permitting anything else. The residence of the Court of Valladolid contributed to its development. In the various grants of privileges given by the kings the services rendered by this <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to the Crown are explicitly stated. In the time of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> and Philip II the rank of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was conferred upon it. In the time of Charles III the colleges which had grown up around the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> were dealt their death blow by the ministry of Roda, and since then the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has suffered from the changes, reforms, and systems which the central government of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> has imposed on all the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>.
