<h1>University of Vienna</h1>  

<h2>Foundation of the university</h2>

<p>Next to the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a> that of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> is the oldest <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of the former Holy Roman Empire. It was founded on 12 March, 1365, by Rudolph IV, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and its charter confirmed on 18 July of the same year by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, a faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> not being included in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authorization. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, planned on too large a scale and not sufficiently endowed, did not prosper; moreover the duke died on 27 July at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. About 1380 his successor, Albert III, called teachers from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and obtained permission from <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, 20 Feb., 1384, for the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. After the drawing up of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> in 1385, and of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, medicine, and philosophy on 1 April, 1389, the organization of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> on the model of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was complete. All members of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, scholars, bachelors, licentiates (who were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to lecture for a certain period), and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, were divided into "nations", <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a>, Rhenish, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a>, and Saxon. Each "nation" elected a proctor from its membership; the head of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> elected semi-annually by the proctors, while his council was composed of the proctors and the deans of the faculties. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was subject to the ruler of the country, who was its patron, but otherwise it was autonomous and had its own <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The permanent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> representative of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Stephen's, who was chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and conferred the academic degrees.

<p>During the first century of its existence the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> repeatedly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it was founded as an institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> chiefly for the extension and defence of the Faith. An address of loyalty (rotulus) was sent to each newly-elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with a request for the confirmation and increase of the privileges. As an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporation the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> took an active part in the Councils of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (1409), <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> (1414), and Basle (1431), and in several <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>. In that era of incessant disorder and scanty revenues, the continued existence of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was possible only when closely connected with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and under the protection of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> granted important <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, e.g., the privilege, granted on 20 Feb., 1384, and 27 May, 1399, that distant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> teaching and studying at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> could be administered by a vicar; the appointment of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conservators (17 Aug., 1411; 21 May, 1434; 12 July, 1513); <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> with the right of pronouncing <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (27 May, 1420; 16 Feb., 1441; 12 July, 1513; 1 July, 1517), and the right of trying and judging <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (16 Feb., 1441). Physicians (28 March, 1452) were protected by a letter of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> in 1406 <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> quacks. The subject matter taught was confined to prescribed books, the method of teaching rigidly scholastic. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students were limited to the Scriptures and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, pastoral theology and Hebrew being added later. At first, in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, canon law alone was taught, but <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> was added in 1484; medicine was still entirely under the spell of sterile Arabian theories. The widest range of subjects belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> (liberal arts) faculty, which, as the introductory course to the three "higher faculties", had the largest number of students. Among the celebrated mathematicians and astronomers of this faculty were Johannes of Gmunden (about 1380-1442), George of Peuerbach (1423-61), and Johannes Muller of Konigberg, also called Regiomontanus (14536-76). A distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and statesman was Thomas Ebendorffer (1387-1464), noted for his part in the Council of Basle.
<h2>Period of prosperity and humanism</h2>

<p>During the reign of Maximilian I (1493-1519) the university enjoyed its first period of prosperity; with the rise of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> about 1490, the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> steadily decreased.
<h2>Decline: reforms</h2>

<p>The disorders after Maximilian's death and the appearance of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> doctrines in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> caused the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to decline rapidly. As early as 1511 it refused to send a representative to a council. The laxity of the medical and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculties in regard to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty on 14 July, 1526, to give back to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> authority in such matters. During the years 1525-30 the number of students steadily declined, the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was hardly more than nominal, and in 1529 that of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> had but two professors. Only the strong hand of Ferdinand I (1522-1564) saved the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> from complete decay; reforming <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> on 2 Aug., 1533; 15 Sept., 1537, and 1 Jan., 1554. It was placed under the direction of a superintendent with large powers, who was appointed by the sovereign. Teachers having regular salaries were appointed to each faculty; the faculties of medicine and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> had each three such professors, the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> four. The period of study was made five years, for the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> course two years. In the medial department more attention was to be paid to practical branches; in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> course <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> was made the most important study. In 1551 Ferdinand I called the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to revive the religious spirit and on 17 Nov., 1558, gave them two permanent <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> professorships. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established a Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a house of studies, and gave <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> courses that were largely attended.


<h2>Non-Catholic tendency and the Counter-reformation</h2>

<p>From 30 March, 1546, each new professor was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to submit to an examination of his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, in order to prevent the admission of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. This regulation was annulled on 5 Sept., 1564, by Maximilian II (1564-76), who also <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that instead of the customary formal profession of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the candidate for degrees had only to declare himself a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>--disregarding the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (13 Nov., 1564). The emperor withdrew one professorship from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and, at the demand of the Diet, ordered the house of studies to be closed. During the reign of Rudolph II (1576-1612), who was by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> a strict <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> was begun. This was due to the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> Melchior Khlesl, appointed chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1579. The first step was the publication on 2 July, 1581, and 31 March, 1591, of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of 13 Nov., 1564; the entrance of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> into the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was thus prevented. In 1565 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> attempted to obtain <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> degrees for the students trained at their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but their appeal was rejected both at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and in 1573. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was not altogether wrong in regarding as an infringement of its privileges the permission granted the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1570 to hold <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> courses in their college. It felt its very existence threatened, especially as the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, e.g. in 1593, had one thousand students, while the entire <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had but two hundred. The dispute was settled by Emperor Matthias (1612-19) on 25 Feb., 1617, who again granted the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> two professorships in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and in addition three in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Finally, during the reign of Ferdinand II (1619-37), the entire <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculties were handed over to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and their college was incorporated into the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (21-22 Oct., 1622; 17 Nov., 1622; 9 Aug., 1623; <em>Sanctio pragmatica</em> of 13 Oct., 1623, confirmed by Ferdinand II on 4 May, 1640). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> renounced in perpetuity any claim to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but on the other hand the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> had a seat and vote directly after the superintendent appointed by the ruler. The election of professors and the methods of teaching were left to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>.

<p>The intent of the Sanctio pragmatica was to make the University <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in its future development. This end was the easier to attain as the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> controlled all the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The matter, however, was more difficult in regard to the students of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine, among whom many were still openly or secretly non-Catholic. The restriction to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was finally effected in these departments by decrees and by the edict of 17 Nov., 1651, which expelled all non-Catholics from the country. Following the example of other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Ferdinand III (1637-57) appointed (17 May, 1649) the feast of the Immaculate Conception as the church feast of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; henceforth before attaining a degree, the rectorship, or a professorship, the candidate was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to profess his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Immaculate Concetion. From 2 Dec., 1656, the dean-elect had also to make this profession. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> alone were exempted (31 Oct., 1649) from this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, but on this account they were excluded from the position of dean. Thanks to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and learning of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> departments flourished greatly; those of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine, however, lagged behind. The reform of studies carried out by Ferdinand I had not the desired success in these two branches, as money was lacking, and the very scanty salaries of the professors were seldom paid. The great disadvantage in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was that German <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, though <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in practice, was not taught. The students of medicine were more fortunate, for after winning the baccalaureate they generally attended an Italian <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, particularly Padua, where better facilities for study were offered, and a shorter period of attendance required. Thus the members of the faculty of medicine were generally physicians <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, as Johann Wilhelm Mannagetta (d. 1660), and Paul de Sorbalt (d. 1691). However, owing to the lack of students and of equipment, there was no stimulus to work. Numerous proposals of reform were made, such as those of 1629, 1687, and 1735, but all attempts to bring the two faculties to a higher level failed on account of the financial embarrassment of the Government.
<h2>Reorganization in the reign of Maria Theresa: university a state institution</h2>

<p>During the reign of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> (1740-80) the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was completely reconstructed. What led to this change was the calling to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1745 of Gerhard van Swieten (1700-72), a medical professor at Leyden, as court physician and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professor. The reforms of the medical faculty, which he planned, went into effect on 7 February: i.e. the designation of van Swieten as director of studies, appointment of professors by the empress, not as before by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> consistory, rigid supervision of the examinations by the Government, establishment of a professorship of chemistry, founding of a botanical garden, and the delivery of clinical lectures in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. They <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> soon excelled the University of Leyden, previously so celebrated; this was effected by the appointment of distinguished teachers, as, in 1749, for chemistry and botany, Alexander Ludwig Laugier, whose successor in 1769 was Nikolaus Jacquin; in 1754, for practical therapeutics, Anton de Haen, whose successor in 1776 was Maximilian Stoll; and Ferdinand Leber, in 1761, for surgery. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculties were reformed in 1753. The professors of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> were forbidden to dictate their lectures to the students as formerly, or to teach the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The plan drawn up for the reform of the department of law by Prince-Archbishop Count Trautson and Sigismund Popowitsch, professor of eloquence, was put in force in 1753. New courses in constitutional law, the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a>, <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> law, the Theresian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the hereditary Austrian dominions, and, as an experiment, history, were established. The director of studies was Johann Franz von Bourguignon. Up to 1757 all matters pertaining to instruction were controlled by Prince-Archbishop Count Trautson, the "protector of studies". The position of superintendent was abolished in 1754.

<p>These reforms took from the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> the last vestiges of its former autonomy, made it entirely subsidiary to the purposes of the State, and turned the professors into state officials. Intellectual life was restricted by the directors of studies who prescribed the text-books to be used, and by the Government censorship of books. The medical faculty suffered least from these limitations and continued to develop. The aim of the prevailing system was to exclude entirely the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; its leading spirits were van Swieten and, in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">freemason</a> Joseph von Sonnenfels (1733-1817). Thus in 1755 the conferring of the degrees at St. Stephen's was abolished, and the influence of the chancellor limited; in 1757 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was removed from the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> consistory, and in 1759 the directors of studies belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> were removed. The court commission of studies, with van Swieten as vice-president, was created on 23 March, 1760, as the chief board of supervision. In the same year the commission made a request for the admission of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to the courses in law and medicine, but did not secure this until 1778. From 18 Jan., 1782, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was open to all creeds. The <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a> in 1773 necessitated the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculties. The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> went to the fund for stipends for students (<em>Jesuitfond</em>); ex-Jesuits were excluded from the new appointments to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> chairs. The process of separating the University from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> continued during the last years of the reign of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> and still more during the reign of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> (1780-90). Abbot Stefan Rautenstrauch of Branau wrote a text-book on canon law, pervaded with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Febronius</a>, that received the approval of the Government in 1776. The <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> before receiving a degree, and in general everything that had the appearance of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> celebration at the graduation exercises, was done away with in 1785. <a href="../cathen/10288a.htm">Prince-Archbishop Count Migazzi</a> protested repeatedly, although in vain, in 1786 against the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> text-books which contained <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> statements and attacks upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> sank to a training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for government officials, the students of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> included. This <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> servitude checked all scientific activity, and in the succeeding years brought the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> into a condition of stagnation from which it could be rescued only by a fundamental reformation of the bureaucratic system.
<h2>Self-governing university since 1848</h2>

<p>The first step towards self-government was taken (on 12 March, 1848) by a general assembly of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which petitioned Ferdinand I (1835-48) for freedom of teaching and study. On 20 March the newly-appointed minister of instruction, Freiherr von Somaruga, promised the speedy granting of academic freedom, and at the same time announced a reform of the courses of study. The medical faculty, still the most important one, made proposals regarding the restoration of the old autonomy, such as the election of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and deans by the professors. On 30 Sept., 1849, this was granted by the provisional law on the organization of academic authorities. A distinction was made in the faculties between the group of professors and that of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> or teachers below professors in rank, each electing a dean. On 13 Oct., 1849, the "general ordinances concerning the system of studies at the royal and imperial universities", with exception of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, was issued; on 1 Oct., 1850, "the general regulations for studies". On 9 Jan., 1865, the year of the celebration of the fifth centenary of the existence of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, fifty-eight professors presented to the minister of instruction, von Schmerling, a memorial which denounced the exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> as no longer just. Pursuant to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 28 April, 1873, on the organization of academic administration, the attainment of an academic dignity is now independent of the candidate's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> character of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is at present limited to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, for the "Protestant <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> institute" that was raised to a faculty in 1850 is not a part of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. On 11 Oct., 1884, the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> building on the Franzen-Ring was dedicated in the presence of Emperor Francis Joseph. In 1857 the "new university house", built in 1756, was given to the academy of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. New <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> for the regulation of the examinations for the doctorate in the three secular faculties were issued on 15 April, 1872. The course of study in the medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> requires five years, in the other faculties four years are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p>The reform of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty indicated a complete break with the <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronian</a>-Josephinist system. There was a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the invitation of the Government on 30 April, 1849; the assembly made the demand that the competent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should have influence over the appointment of professors, that he should appoint half of the board of examiners, and that all should be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> before appointment to make the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> Confession of Faith. This request was granted on 30 June, 1850. The plan of study approved by the Government on 29 March, 1858, and still in use, was worked out by <a href="../cathen/12660b.htm">Prince-Archbishop Rauscher</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> governing the examination for the doctorate were issued on 16 Jan., 1894. In respect to the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of conferring degrees it was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 19 May, 1880, that the protector or the dean of the faculty of which the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was a member should be the presiding officer in case the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was not a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.

<p>On 18 Oct., 1849, temporary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were issued regulating the study of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and political economy; on 2 Oct., 1855, these ordinances were revised, and on 20 April, 1893, the present <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> respecting studies and examinations for the doctorate were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. The original freedom of study was limited in so far that students must pass three state examinations at fixed times. The medical faculty, which even before 1848 had a high reputation, gained a world-wide renown both by the calling of foreigners to professorships, as Ernst Brucke (1849-92), Johann Oppolzer (1850- 71), and Theodor Billroth (1865-94), and others, and by the work of native investigators, as Karl Rokitansky (1844-78), <a href="../cathen/07611b.htm">Joseph Hyrtl</a> (1845-74), <a href="../cathen/14035a.htm">Joseph Skoda</a> (1846-81), and Ferdinand Hebra (1849-80). The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of 1872, respecting examinations for the doctorate, those concerning the organization of the medical instruction (1 June, 1872) and of the practical tests in the examination for the medical degree (24 Oct., 1872), put an end to the institute for partially trained medical men (surgeons) and instead only permitted the gaining of "the doctorate of the entire <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of medicine" (<em>medicinae universae doctor</em>), with which the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to practise medicine is united. On 21 Dec., 1899, a new series of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> suited to modern needs was issued in regard to the examinations for the doctorate. In the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty the former two years' preparatory course was transferred to the gymnasium (18 May, 1845); the departments of natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> (chemistry, natural history) were taken over from the medical faculty on 16 Nov., 1849. Besides increasing the number of professorial chairs, seminars and institutes for scientific research and for the training of teachers of the intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were established. Among the distinguished scholars of this faculty should be mentioned: in physics, Christian Doppler (1850-53); in <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, Karl von Littrow (1842-77); in photographic optics, Josef Max Petzval (1837- 77); in the history of art, Rudolf von Eitelberger (1852-85); in classical philology, Hermann Bonitz (1849-67).
