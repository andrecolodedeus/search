<h1>Upper Nile</h1>  

<p>Vicariate apostolic; separated from the mission of Nyanza, 6 July, 1894, comprises the eastern portion of Uganda, that is roughly east of a line from Fauvera on the Nile (about 2&#176;13' N. lat.), north-east to the Kaffa mountains, and of a line south from Fauvera past Munynyu near Lake Victoria Nyanza to 1&#176; S. lat. Of the native tribes, the Baganda, partly Caucasian, are much superior intellectually to the others. Their religion was spiritualistic, acknowledging a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> <em>Katonda</em>, who, being good, was neglected, while the <em>loubalis</em>, or demon, and <em>mzimus</em>, or departed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, were propitiated. <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">Totemism</a> was prevalent, the <em>mziro</em>, or totem, being usually an animal, rarely a plant. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries, the <a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">White Fathers</a> arrived in Uganda in 1878. Father Lourdel obtained leave from King Mtesa to enter; on 26 June, 1879, the fathers reached Roubaga.

<p>On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Saturday, 27 March, 1880, the first <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; two years later the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> induced Mtesa to expel the missionaries; they returned under his successor, Mwanga, 14 July, 1885. Religion spread rapidly, but the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> stirred up the king to begin a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Joseph Mkasa, chief of the royal pages, was the proto-martyr; on 26 May, 1886, thirty newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, on refusing to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, were burnt to death; soon more than seventy others were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>. Then the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> plotted to depose Mwanga, but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the advice of Father Lourdel remained loyal. The <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> thereupon expelled the missionaries, who, however, returned in 1889: Father Lourdel endeavoured to induce Mwango to submit to the advancing British Company; on 12 May, 1890, worn out by his labours this pioneer of the Gospel died. His confreres continued to reap a rich harvest, but were opposed by Captain Luard, the British Company's agent. On 23 May, 1893, Uganda passed under the protection of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gained comparative peace. Mgr Livinhac, now Superior General of the <a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>, obtained the erection of the eastern portion of Uganda into a separate vicariate under the care of the English congregation of Foreign Missions, Mill Hill, London.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was Mgr. Henry Hanlon, b. on 7 Jan., 1862, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14513a.htm">Teos</a> in 1894, went to Uganda in 1895; after labouring there for seventeen years, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for the general chapter of his Society, and retired from active missionary work. He was succeeded (June, 1912) by Mgr. John Biermans, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06384c.htm">Gargara</a>. Coming to Uganda in 1896 he proved himself a valuable auxiliary to Mgr. Hanlon. The episcopal residence is at Mengo, Buganda, near Entebbe, capital of Uganda. In the mission there are 24 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 6 Missionary <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Mary; 15 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; 12 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 1649 pupils; and about 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The missionaries have recently compiled and printed in Uganda, a grammar phrase-book, and a vocabulary of a Nilotic language, Dh&ouml; Levo, spoken in Kavirondo. The language had not previously been reduced to writing. Some primers, catechisms, and <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayer-books</a> also in Dh&ouml; Levo have been printed.
