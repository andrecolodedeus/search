<h1>Urgel</h1>  

<p>(U<font size=-2>RGELLENSIS</font>).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>; bounded on the N. by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; E. by the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, and L&eacute;rida; S. and W. by L&eacute;rida, which includes most of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the latter, however, extends to some towns of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, and the valleys of Andorra. The capital, Seo de Urgel, is situated in the northern part of <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>, between the Segre and Balira, and has 4000 inhabitants. The city, one of the most ancient of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, belonged to the Ilergetas and is called Orgia or Orgelia on the Iberian <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced into Urgel at a very early period. <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Urgel, attended the Second Council of Toledo in 527. He also attended the First Council of <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>, 546, and wrote on the Canticle of Canticles a work dedicated to Sergius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>. St. Isidore mentions him and his three brothers in his "Varones ilustres". Simplicius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Urgel, figures in the Third Council of Toledo and the names of his successors, in later councils of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, and the Second Council of Barcelona. Lubericus, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> invasion, attended the Sixteenth Council of Toledo. The line of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> continued uninterruptedly during the period of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> dominion. The city, however, was totally destroyed, a district called <em>Vicus Urgelli</em> alone surviving. Reconquered and taken possession of by the French the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was governed by Felix who with Elipandus of Toledo propagated <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in which it appears he died, notwithstanding the fact that he had several times <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> it. Learned and except for his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> tendencies, virtuous, he died in exile in Le&oacute;n, 804, and for this reason the people of Urgel in ancient times <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> him as one of their seven <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. About 885 Bishop Ingobert was expelled from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by the intruder Selva, who, under the protection of the Count of Urgel, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Gascony. This usurper also unlawfully placed Hermemiro over the <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">See of Gerona</a>. In 892 a synod was held in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">Church</a> of Santa Mar&iacute;a in Urgel; the two usurpers were deposed, their vestments rent, their crosiers broken over their heads, and they were deprived of their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> faculties. Bishop Saint Amengol died on 3 Nov., 1035. Another saint and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Urgel was Odo, son of Count de Pallas (1095-1122). Arnaldus of Perexens retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bellpuig in 1194. His successor Bernardo de Castell&oacute; attended the Third Council of the Lateran, and in 1198 retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Aspir in the Diocese of Elne. In the last century Jos&eacute; Caixal, who distinguished himself at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> and was so cordially detested by the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Urgel (1853-79). When Seo de Urgel was captured by Mart&iacute;nez Campos during the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, exiled and died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
<h2>Andorra</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Urgel have from very ancient times been sovereign princes of the Andorra valleys. When <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> liberated the City of Urgel from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> yoke he conferred on its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Posidonius I the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to one tenth of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of the valleys. When the territory was reconquered and colonized by Louis the Pious he conferred the sovereignty on the Count of Urgel. These counts and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> contended for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the Andorran valleys until 26 Oct., 1040, when on the occasion of the dedication of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Urgel the Countess Constancia accompanied by her son Armengol, a minor, ceded to Bishop Eribaldus her right of sovereignty over Andorra. The contentions, however, were renewed between Count Armengol and Bishop Bernardo de Castell&oacute;. The latter had recourse to Raimundo Roger I, Count of Foix, promising to share with him the government of Andorra. Relying on this agreement Roger Bernardo III, Count of Foix, in 1264, invaded the estates of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Urgel. This <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was ended by arbitration. Jatvert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, acting with the other arbitrators, drew up an agreement known as the "Pariatges", which was accepted by the Count de Foix on 7 Sept., 1278, and later confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>. This convention still forms the Constitution of Andorra, a neutral territory, known as a republic. According to it the valleys recognized as their lawful sovereigns the Count de Foix and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Urgel, each of whom appointed a <em>veguer</em> (vicar), who jointly administered the government. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the counts of Foix passed to the Bourbons, kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and subsequently to the French Government; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Urgel still retain a nominal suzerainty and the title of "principes soberanos" of Andorra.

<p>The ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Andorra was destroyed; the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dates from the time of Bishop Eribaldus and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1040, although the building was continued until late into the thirteenth century. It is an example of the Romanesque of the second period resembling the transition period architecture of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Adjoining the church is a twelfth-century <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, restored in the sixteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> possesses a rich collection of ancient jewelled altar-vessels and ornaments. The archives contain a famous collection of very ancient documents, some of which date from the time of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings. Inside the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Odo, and outside are the churches of San Miguel and San August&iacute;n. To the east of the city are situated the citadel, the castle, and the tower of <a href="../cathen/14138c.htm">Solsona</a>, which figured prominently in the late civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was erected by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, 13 August, 1592; the new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was built by Bishop Caixal and is one of the finest buildings in the city. The episcopal palace is also striking. There are two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, military and civil, the latter being installed in the former Convent of the Augustinians. There is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of sisters devoted to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian education</a>, a foundling and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was declared a minor basilica on 9 Dec., 1905. The diminutive republic (6000) is governed by a popularly elected council of ex-members and a syndic or president, elected by the council for life. Its inhabitants are mostly shepherds, and speak Catalan.
