<h1>Use of Beads at Prayers</h1>  

<p>Beads variously strung together, according to the kind, order, and number of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in certain forms of devotion, are in common use among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as an expedient to ensure a right count of the parts occurring in more or less frequent repetition. Made of materials ranging from common wood or natural berries to costly metals a precious stones, they may be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, as they are in most cases, with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, thereby becoming <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>. In this character they are prescribed by the rules of most <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, both of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, to be kept for personal use or to be worn as part of the religious garb. They are now mostly found in the form of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Dominican Rosary</a>, or Marian <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>; but <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are also familiar with the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> beads, the Dolour beads, the Immaculate Conception beads, the Crown of Our Saviour, the Chaplet of the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">Five Wounds</a>, the Crosier beads, and others. In all these devotions, due to individual <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> or fostered by particular religious bodies, the beads serve one and the same purpose of distinguishing and numbering the constituent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> criticism generally ascribes an Oriental origin to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> beads; but man's natural tendency to iteration, especially of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and the spirit and training of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may still safely be assumed to have spontaneously suggested fingers, pebbles, knotted cords, and strings of beads or berries as a means of counting, when it was desired to say a specific number of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The earliest historical indications of the use of beads at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> show, in this as in other things, a natural growth and development. Beads strung together or ranged on chains are an obvious improvement over the well-known primitive method instanced, for example, in the life of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Abbot Paul (d. A.D. 341), who used to take three hundred pebbles into his lap as counters and to drop one as he finished each of the corresponding number of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> it was his wont to say daily. In the eighth century the penitentials, or rule books pertaining to penitents, prescribed various penances of twenty, fifty, or more, paters. The strings of beads, with the aid of which such penances were accurately said, gradually came to be known as paternosters. Archaeological records mention fragments of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> beads found in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> <a href="../cathen/06533c.htm">Gertrude of Nivelles</a> (d. 659); also similar devices discovered in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of St. Norbert and of <a href="../cathen/13184a.htm">St. Rosalia</a>, both of the twelfth century. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> quote <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> (De Gest. Pont. Angl., IV, 4) as stating that the Countess Godiva, who founded a religious house at Coventry in 1040, donated, when she was about to die, a circlet or string of costly precious stones on which she used to say her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, to be placed on a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. In the course of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, such paternosters came into extensive use especially in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. At certain times corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>, <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and lay sisters were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to say a certain number of <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Fathers</a> as an equivalent of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>, likewise, notably the Knights of St. John, adopted the paternoster beads as a part of the equipment of lay members. In the fifteenth century, wearing the beads at one's girdle was a distinctive sign of membership in a religious confraternity or third order. If a certain worldliness in the use of beads as ornaments in those days had to be checked, as it was by various capitulary ordinances prohibiting <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, for instance, from having beads of coral, crystal, amber, etc., and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from wearing beads around the neck, evidence is not wanting that paternosters were also openly carried as a sign of penance, especially by bands of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> processionally visiting the shrines, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and other holy places at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. From their purpose, too, it is natural that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> beads were prized as gifts of friendship. They were especially valued if they had been worn by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of known <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> or if they had touched the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of any saint, in which cases they were often piously believed to be the instruments of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> power and healing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>Beads were generally strung either on a straight thread, or cord, or so as to form a circlet, or loop. At the present time chained beads have almost entirely taken the place of the corded ones. To facilitate the counting or to mark off certain divisions of a devotion, sets of beads, usually decades, are separated from each other by a larger bead or sometimes by a <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> or metal cross. The number of beads on a chaplet, or <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, depends on the number of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> making up each particular form of devotion. A full <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> consists of one hundred and fifty Hail Marys, fifteen <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Fathers</a>, and three or four beads corresponding to introductory versicles and the "Glory be to the Father", etc. Such a "pair of beads" is generally worn by religious. Lay people commonly have beads representing a third part of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> beads number seven paters in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the sorrows and joys of the Blessed Virgin, and sixty-three aves to commemorate the years of her life. Another Crown of Our Lady, in use among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, has seventy-two aves, based on another tradition of the Blessed Virgin's age. The devotion of the Crown of Our Lord consists of thirty-three paters in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the years of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> on earth and five aves in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">His sacred wounds</a>. In the church Latin of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, many names were applied to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> beads as: <em>devotiones, signacula, oracula, precaria, patriloquium, serta, preculae, numeralia, computum, calculi,</em> and others. An Old English form, <em>bedes</em>, or <em>bedys</em>, meant primarily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. From the end of the fifteenth century and in the beginning of the sixteenth, the name <em>paternoster beads</em> fell into disuse and was replaced by the name <em>ave beads</em> and <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, chaplet, or crown.

<p>The use of beads among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> is undoubtedly of greater antiquity than their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> use; but there is no evidence to show that the latter is derived from the former, any more than there is to establish a relation between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotions</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> forms of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. One <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> used a chaplet consisting generally of one hundred and eight beads made of the wood of the sacred Tulsi shrub, to tell the names of Vishnu; and another accomplished its invocations of Siva by means of a string of thirty-two or sixty-four berries of the Rudr&acirc;ksha tree. These or other species of seeds or berries were chosen as the material for these chaplets on account of some traditional association with the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>, as recorded in sacred legends. Some of the ascetics had their beads made of the teeth of dead bodies. Among some <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, especially the votaries of Vishnu, a string of beads is placed on the neck of children when, at the age of six or seven, they are about to be initiated and to be instructed in the use of the sacred formularies. Most <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> continue to wear the beads both for ornament and for use at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>, whose religion is of <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminic</a> origin, various prayer-formulas are said or repeated with the aid of beads made of wood, berries, coral, amber, or precious metals and stones. A string of beads cut from the bones of some holy lama is especially valued. The number of beads is usually one hundred and eight; but strings of thirty or forty are in use among the poorer classes. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> in <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> alike employs a number of more or less complicated forms of devotion, but the frequently recurring conclusion, a form of salutation, is mostly the same, and contains the mystic word <em>OM</em>, supposed to have reference to the Buddhistic trinity. It is not uncommon to find keys and trinkets attached to a <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> beads, and generally each string is provided with two little cords of special counters, ten in number, in the form of beads or metal disks. At the end of one of these cords is found a miniature thunderbolt; the other terminates in a tiny bell. With the aid of this device the devotee can count a hundred repetitions of his beads or 108 x 10 x 10 formulas in all. Among the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, especially elaborate systems of counting exist. One apparatus is described as capable of registering 36,736 <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or repetitions.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> use a string of ninety-nine (or one hundred) beads called the <em>subha</em> or <em>tasbih</em>, on which they recite the "beautiful" names or attributes of <a href="../cathen/01316a.htm">Allah</a>. It is divided into three equal parts either by a bead or special shape or size, or by a tassel of gold or silk thread. The use of these <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamic</a> beads appears to have been established as early as the ninth century independently of Buddhistic influences. Some critics have thought the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> chaplet is kindred to a Jewish form of one hundred <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. The beads in general use are said to be often made of the sacred clay of <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> or Medina. Among travellers; records of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> beads is the famous instance, by <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>, of the King of Malabar, who wore a fine silk thread strung with one hundred and four large pearls and rubies, on which he was wont to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to his idols. Alexander Von Humboldt is also quoted as finding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> beads, called Quipos, among the native <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvians</a>.
