<h1>Utopia</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>ou</em> no or not, and <em>topos</em> place), a term used to designate a visionary or an ideally perfect state of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The name was first used by <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a> in his work entitled "De optimo reipublicae statu deque nova insula Utopia" (Louvain, 1516), and has since been used as a generic term for political romances. Such a romance, to which <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More</a> was indebted for many of his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, is <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> "Republic". In this work <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> prescribes a <a href="../cathen/04179a.htm">communistic</a> mode of life for the guardians and auxiliaries (not for the productive classes) of the State. The superior qualities of the guardian and auxiliary class were to be maintained by the practice of stirpiculture and state control of the bringing up of children. In the "Republic", the ends sought are political rather than <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a>. <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a>, on the other hand, does not confine his attention to the governing class but includes the whole social structure in his plan. He puts most of his narrative into the mouth of a certain Raphael Hythloday, a Portuguese traveller, who criticizes trenchantly the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and customs of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> states, and paints in glowing colours the ideal institutions which he had observed in a five years' sojourn among the Utopians. Hythloday contends that English <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are badly administered. The thief and the murderer alike are <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">punished with death</a> with no consequent diminution of the crime of theft. Means should be taken rather to see that men are not driven to steal. The servant class, for example, should learn trades, so that they need not have recourse to highway <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> when dismissed by their masters. Also some provision should be made for agricultural labourers that they might not follow a like profession when the arable lands were converted into sheep runs, a crying <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at that time. He contended further that most of the difficulties of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> government grew out of the institution of private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The objection is made that a nation cannot be prosperous where all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is common because there would be no incentive to labour, men would become <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and bloodshed would result. Hythloday answers this objection by giving an account of the institutions and customs of the Utopians.

<p>In the Island of Utopia lying south of the equator there are fifty-four cities of which no two are nearer together than twenty-four miles. The government is representative in form. From each city three wise and experienced men are sent each year to the capital to deliberate on public affairs. The rural population live in farm-houses scattered throughout the island, each of which contains at least forty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> besides two slaves. For every thirty farm-houses there is a leader called a philarch. Ten philarchs together with their groups of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> are under an officer called a chief philarch. The prince of the island is chosen for life by the philarchs from four candidates nominated by the people. He may be deposed if he is suspected of tyranny. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are few in number and seldom violated. Among the Utopians agriculture is a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in which all are instructed. The children in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> learn its history and theory. From each group of thirty farms twenty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are sent annually to the neighbouring cities to make room for an equal number who come from the city to the country. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> all have a taste of farm life. In addition to agriculture each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is taught a trade. Usually he selects his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> trade, but if he desires to learn another he is allowed to do so. The Utopians work only six hours a day but this is sufficient to provide them with all the necessaries and comforts of life, for the reason that there are so few idlers and that no time is spent in supplying useless or vicious luxuries. In the cities groups of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> have common dining-halls, although anyone who chooses to do so may dine at his own house. The menial service in these dining-rooms is performed by slaves, while the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the various <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> by turns superintend the preparation of the meals. When the Utopians have produced a supply sufficient to last them for two years, they use any surplus which they may have to carry on commerce with neighbouring nations, securing from them gold, silver, iron, and such other things as they need. They do not use gold and silver as money, since they have common ownership of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but they procure it principally in order to hire mercenaries from among their neighbours. In music, arithmetic, and geometry they are not surpassed by the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> and meteorology they far outstrip them.

<p>There are different varieties of religion, but their public worship is of such a general nature that they are able to worship together. All <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> except <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a> are tolerated. Their ethics is Hedonistic and very few of them are attracted by an ascetic life. Those convicted of heinous crimes are reduced to slavery, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> in other countries are also procured as slaves. Children of slaves do not retain the status of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Persons afflicted with incurable and painful diseases are advised by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and magistrates to take their own lives. If they do not wish to do so, however, they are not compelled to. Those who commit <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and magistrates are given dishonourable burial, and those who meet death cheerfully have their bodies <a href="../cathen/04481c.htm">cremated</a> as a mark of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> are not allowed to marry under the age of eighteen nor men under the age of twenty-two. Much care is taken to make those contracting marriage acquainted with each other so as to avoid unhappy unions. <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">Divorces</a> are permitted for one cause, and only the innocent party may remarry. The Utopian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are of extreme <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> but their numbers are small. They are elected by the people by secret ballot. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> are not excluded from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, though few of them - and these <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> - are chosen. The <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is held in high <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The traveller concludes his account by attributing the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and concord prevailing in Utopia to the absence of private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.

<p>It is sometimes asked whether <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More</a> meant to have the proposals in the Utopia taken seriously. Undoubtedly he did not. They were merely a means by which he could call attention to some of the abuses of his day without being taken to task by the king for his freedom. While he shows that he appreciates the weakness of communism, he allows Hythloday to present only its strength. Since <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More's</a> day many ideal commonwealths in imitation of the Utopia have flourished in literature. Among the best known are: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon's</a> "New Atlantis" (1624), in which the author dreams of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> attained through the progress of the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/03221b.htm">Campanella's</a> "City of the Sun" (1637), which emphasizes community of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and stirpiculture; <li>Harrington's "Oceana" (1656); <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon's</a> "Telemaque" (1699); Cabet's "Voyage in Icaria" (1840); <li>Bellamy's "Looking Backward" (1889); <li>William Morris's "News from Nowhere" (1890); <li>Hertzka's "Freiland" (1891); and <li>H. G. Wells's "A Modern Utopia" (1905) and "New Worlds for Old" (1908).</ul> Morley's "Ideal Commonwealths" contains an English translation of <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More's</a> "Utopia" as well as of <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon's</a> "New Atlantis", Campanelia's "City of the Sun", and other imaginary states.
