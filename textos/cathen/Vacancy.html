<h1>Vacancy</h1>  

<p>The state of being vacant, free, unoccupied: a term applied to an office or position devoid of an incumbent, as a vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, professorship, etc. Vacancies occur by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> act of the incumbent or by compulsion. Generally speaking any cleric, even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, for just reasons may resign his office, the resignation being effective when duly accepted by the competent superior. As the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has no superior, <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a>, who renounced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, published a special Constitution (L. I, tit. 7 in 6&#176;) declaring that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> is competent to accept the formal abdication of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Under certain conditions with approval of proper authority, an exchange of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> or offices is permitted. Certain acts, licit or illicit, are equivalent to tacit renunciation, for example, when one accepts a promotion, makes a solemn <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, violates the canons concerning a plurality of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, renounces the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state. Under compulsion one loses his incumbency by death or removal. Some vacancies are provided for before they actually occur; for example, coadjutors may be named with the right of succession, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may make an appointment to go into effect at the death of the present incumbent, an exercise of the so-called <em>jus praeventionis</em>, at one time quite common. Removal ordinarily is a punishment, and no one should be punished without cause (sine culpa, nisi subsit causa, non est aliquis puniendus. Reg. 23 in 6&#176;). The cause is usually, though not always, a crime committed. When removal is a penalty, the crime for which it is inflicted must be proven juridically. If the reason for dismissal be merely unfitness (<em>causa non crimonosa</em>), a juridical trial is not generally <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, though certain formalities are necessarily observed to establish the existence of sufficient warrant for removal, as well as to give the occupant an opportunity of being heard. This is particularly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the administrative removal of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or rectors in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Maxima cura" (S.C. Consist., 20 Aug., 1910). This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> permits such removal (without juridical trial) on account of insanity; inexperience or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of such nature as seriously to impede a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in his work; deafness, blindness or other ailment, physical or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>, incapacitating a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> for a long time, unless provision can be made for a coadjutor; <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or ill will on the part of the people, though <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and not universal; loss of reputation among men of repute; maladministration of temporal affairs; continual neglect after one or two admonitions of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of moment; disobedience after warning of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> in grave matters.

<p>Some, like removable rectors, are transferable at the will of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Care however should be taken not to transfer such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> against their will to inferior posts, as this would be considered a punishment. <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicars-general</a> and deans lose their office by the death or resignation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the cessation for any reason whatever of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. A <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> or administrator of a vacant see retains his office till the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> appointing a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are duly presented. No serious change of moment in the status of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is permitted during an interregnum in accordance with the prohibition: <em>Ne sede vacante aliquid innovetur</em> (Decr. L., III, tit. 9).

<p>In liturgy a Sunday is said to be vacant when no mention of it is made in the Office or Mass; such are the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> that fall on the feast or the Octave of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, St. Stephen, St. John <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>, <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>, Epiphany or the vigil of Epiphany. Days too are liturgically vacant or free when unoccupied by a feast, privileged vigil or privileged <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> office; they are days to which no special Office is assigned.
