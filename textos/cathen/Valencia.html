<h1>Valencia</h1>  

<p>(VALENTINA).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> located in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; comprises the civil Provinces of Valencia, Alicante, and Castell&oacute;n. The city of Valencia is in the region known in ancient days as Edetania, and has 173,000 inhabitants. Florus says that Junius Brutus, the conqueror of Viriathus, transferred thither (140 B.C.) the soldiers who had fought under the latter. Later it was a Roman military colony. In punishment for its adherence to Sertorius it was destroyed by Pompey, but was later rebuilt, and Pomponius Mela says that it was one of the principal cities of Hispania Tarraconensis.

<p>Nothing positive is known about the introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into Valencia, but at the beginning of the fourth century when Dacianus brought the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> St. Valerius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, St. Vincent of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, to Valencia, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> seem to have been numerous. St. Vincent suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Valencia; the faithful obtained possession of his remains, built a temple over the spot on which he died, and there invoked his intercession. It is said that at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> invasion the people of Valencia placed the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body in a boat and that the boat landed on the cape which is now called San Vincente. The King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, Alfonso Enriquez, found the body and transferred it to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Valencia is Justinianus (531-46), mentioned by St. Isidore in his "Viri illustres". Justinianus wrote "Responsiones", a series of replies to a certain Rusticus. Bishops of Valencia assisted at the various councils of Toledo. Witisclus, present at the fourteenth Council of Toledo, was the last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> before the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> invasion. Abdelazid, son of Muzza, took the city and, breaking the terms of surrender, pillaged it; he turned the churches into mosques, leaving only one to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. This was without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the present Church of San Bartolom&eacute; or that of San Vincente de la Roqueta.

<p>Valencia was in the power of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> for more than five centuries. The <a href="../cathen/03769a.htm">Cid</a> (Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar) reconquered it for the first time on 15 June, 1094, turned nine mosques into churches, and installed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> J&eacute;r&ocirc;me. On the death of the <a href="../cathen/03769a.htm">Cid</a> (July, 1099), his wife, Do&ntilde;a Ximena, retained power for two years, when Valencia was beseiged by the Almoravids; although the Emperor Alfonso drove them from the city, he was not strong enough to hold it. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> set fire to it, abandoned it, and the Almoravid Masdali took possession of it on 5 May, 1109. Jaime the Conqueror, with an army composed of French, English, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, laid siege to Valencia in 1238, and on 28 September of that year forced a surrender. 50,000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> left the city and on 9 October the king, followed by his retinue and army, took possession. The principal mosque was purified, <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated, and the "Te Deum" sung. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was re-established, ten <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> being formed in the city; the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a> and <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> who had helped in the conquest, also <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Augustinians, Mercederians, and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, opened houses. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Vincente outside the walls was rebuilt and beside it a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Berenguer de Castellbisbal, bishop-elect of the See of Valencia after the reconquest, was prevented because of the dispute between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Toledo and Tarragona for <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the new see. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> decided in favour of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, and, as Berenguer had been appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a> in the meantime, Ferrer de San Mart&iacute;n, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> (1239-43), was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Valencia. He was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Arag&oacute;nese</a> Arnau de Peralta (1243-48) who drove the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, Pedro Garc&eacute;s, from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Valencia, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Andr&eacute;s Albalat (1248-76), founder of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, began the construction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; this was continued and finished by his successors: Gasperto de Botonach, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of San Felin (1276-88); the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Arag&oacute;nese</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Raimundo de Pont (1288-1312); the Catalonian Raimundo Gast&oacute;n (1312-48); Hugo de Fenolet, formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a> (1348-56); and Vidal de Blanes (1356-69. Jaime de Arag&oacute;n, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a> and first cousin of Pedro IV, succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1369. Hitherto the chapter had elected the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but owing to the dissensions at the death of Bishop Blanes, <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> reserved the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to name the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> until 1523, when the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> was granted to the Spanish kings. At the death of Jaime (1396), the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> kept the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> vacant for more than two years, and then appointed Hugo de Lupia, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a> (1398-1427). He was succeeded by Alfonso de Borja (Calixtus III). The latter appointed Rodrigo de Borja (<a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>) to the See of Valencia; Rodrigo obtained from <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> the rank of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (1492) and, after he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, confirmed this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. He also raised the <em>studium generale</em> of Valencia to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, conferring upon it all the privileges possessed by other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. Cesar Borgia bore the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Valencia, and was succeeded by Juan de Borja y Llansol, Pedro Luis de Borja, and Alfonso de Arag&oacute;n, <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son of Ferdinand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and also <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a> (1512-20).



<p>The episcopate of the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/14696a.htm">St. Thomas of Villanova</a> (1544-55), founder of the Colegio de la Presentaci&oacute;n de Ntra. Se&ntilde;ora, called also de Santo Tom&aacute;s, was one of the most notable in the history of Valencia. St. Thomas was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> (1619) by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> (1658) by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>. His successors, Francisco de Navarra and Mart&iacute;n de Ayala, who attended the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, were also men of distinction. Perhaps the most noted of all the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Valencia was the Patriarch Juan de Ribera (1569-1611). He decided to expel the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> from the city, after exhausted all possible means to bring them to submission. He founded the Colegio de <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> and furthered the work of monastic reform, especially among the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, whom he had brought to Valencia. Many holy men shed lustre upon this era, including St. Louis Bertram, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Nicol&aacute;s Factor, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Francisco de Ni&ntilde;o Jes&uacute;s, and the <a href="../cathen/10325a.htm">Minim</a> Gaspar Bono. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and inquisitor general, Juan Tom&aacute;s Rocaberti, publicly punished the Governor of Valencia for interfering in <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>: Andr&eacute;s Mayoral (1738-69) improved the system of charities and public instruction, founded the Colegio de las Escuelas P&iacute;as, and the Casa de Ensenanza for girls. He collected a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of 12,000 volumes; this was burnt in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of independence. The See of Valencia has had two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Barrio y Fern&aacute;ndez and Monescillo y Sancho.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in the early days of the reconquest was called <em>Iglesia Mayor</em>, then <em>Seo (Sedes)</em>, and at the present time, in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> concession of 16 October, 1866, it is called the <em>Basilica metropolitana</em>. It is situated in the centre of the ancient Roman city where some believe the temple of Diana stood. In Gothic times it seems to have been dedicated to the most Holy Saviour; the <a href="../cathen/03769a.htm">Cid</a> dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin; Jaime the Conqueror did likewise, leaving in the main <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> the image of the Blessed Virgin which he carried with him and which is believed to be the one which is now preserved in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> mosque, which had been converted into a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church by the conqueror, appeared unworthy of the title of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Valencia, and in 1262 Bishop Andr&eacute;s de Albalat laid the cornerstone of the new Gothic building, with three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>; these reach only to the choir of the present building. Bishop Vidal de Blanes built the magnificent chapter hall, and Jaime de Arag&oacute;n added the tower, called "Miguelete" because it was blessed on <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael's</a> day (1418), which is about 166 feet high and finished at the top with a <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">belfry</a>. In the fifteenth century the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> was added and the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the over-ornate style of that decadent period. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the fourteenth century, the other is that of the Pal&aacute;u. The additions made to the back of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> detract from its height. The eighteenth-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, and the presbyterium. It contains many <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by eminent artists. A magnificent silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. Behind the Chapel of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is a very beautiful little <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> built by <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Calixtus III</a>. Beside the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the "Virgen de los desamparados".

<p>In 1409 a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was founded and placed under the patronage of Santa Mar&iacute;a de los Inocentes; to this was attached a confraternity devoted to recovering the bodies of the unfriended dead in the city and within a radius of three miles around it. At the end of the fifteenth century this confraternity separated from the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and continued this work under the name of "Cofradia para el &aacute;mparo de los desamparados". Philip IV and the Duke de Arcos suggested the building of the new <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and in 1647 the Viceroy Conde de Orpesa, who ad been preserved from the bubonic plague, insisted on carrying out their project. The Blessed Virgin under the title of "Virgen de los desamparados" was proclaimed patroness of the city, and Archbishop Pedro de Urbina, on 31 June, 1652, laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of this name. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace, a grain market in the time of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, is simple in design, with an inside <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> and a handsome <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. In 1357 the arch which connects it with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built. In the council chamber are preserved the portraits of all the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Valencia.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches those deserving special mention are: Sts. John (Baptist and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>), rebuilt in 1368, whose <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>, decorated by Palonino, contains some of the best frescoes of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; The Temple (El Templo), the ancient church of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a>, which passed into the hands of the Order of Montessa and which was rebuilt in the reigns of Ferdinand VI and Charles III; the former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, at present the headquarters of the "capital general", the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of which has a beautiful Gothic wing and the chapter room, large columns imitating palm trees; the Colegio del <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, which is devoted to the exclusive worship of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and in which perpetual adoration is carried on; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, which was destroyed (1868) by the revolutionary Committee, but rebuilt on the same site; the Colegio de San Juan (also of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>), the former college of the nobles, now a provincial institute for secondary instruction.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was built in 1831; from 1790 it was situated at he former house of studies of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Since the Concordat (1851) it ranks as a central <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with the faculty of conferring academic degrees. There have been in Valencia, since very remote times, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> founded by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and directed by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. In 1412 a <em>studium generale</em> with special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> was established. <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> raised it to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> on 23 January, 1500. Ferdinand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> confirmed this two years later. In 1830 the building was reconstructed; a statute of Luis Viv&eacute;s adorns the corridor. Among the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> may be mentioned: the Casa de Misericordia; the Provincial <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> of San Vicente; and the Infant Asylum of the Marqu&eacute;s de Campo. In Gandi there was a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and the palace of <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>, now the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, is preserved.
