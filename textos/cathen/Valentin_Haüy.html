<h1>Valentin Ha&uuml;y</h1>  

<p>Founder of the first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind, and known under the endearing name of "Father and Apostle of the Blind"; b. at Saint-Just, in the department of Picardy, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 13 November, 1745: d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 19 March, 1822. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> with his elder brother, <a href="../cathen/07152a.htm">R&eacute;ne</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, not far from Saint-Just. Valentin never became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. After his preliminary studies he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he applied himself to calligraphy and to modern languages. These he taught for a time, to support himself, until he became attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an interpreter of state papers and foreign despatches. The inspiration to devote the remainder of his life to the <a href="../cathen/05306a.htm">education of the blind</a> came to Ha&uuml;y in 1771 after witnessing at a fair, in one of the suburbs of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, burlesque performance in which the blindness of sightless beggars was made the object of ridicule and general merriment. "I shall substitute truth for mockery", he said to himself; "I shall teach the blind to read and to write, and give them books printed by themselves." This was no empty boast. The inspiration to do for the blind what the Abb&eacute; de l'Ep&eacute;e was then doing for the deaf and dumb became an accomplished fact thirteen years later. In June, 1784 Ha&uuml;y sought his first pupil at the church door of Saint-Germain des Pres. Francois Lesueur, who was a beggar and blind from birth, was then sixteen years old. Ha&uuml;y prevailed upon him to give up begging by promising to support his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Before the fall of 1786 Ha&uuml;y had made the discovery of what had only dimly been foreshadowed, the art of printing books in relief for the blind. This discovery, the undisputed triumph of Ha&uuml;y's ingenuity, solved for all time the most difficult problem in the <a href="../cathen/05306a.htm">education of the blind</a> and, with the foundation of the first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind, led to a movement which has resulted in the social and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> rehabilitation of the blind throughout the whole civilized world. By 5 December, 1786, Ha&uuml;y's pupils had embossed from movable letterpress type his "Essai sur l'&eacute;ducation des aveugles" the first book ever published for the blind (see S.V., <a href="../cathen/05306a.htm">EDUCATION OF THE BLIND</a>, V, 308). On 26 December of the same year, twenty-four of Ha&uuml;y's pupils gave at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> in the presence of Louis XVI and the royal family an exhibition of their attainments in reading, writing, geography, arithmetic, handcraft work, and orchestral music. With the patronage of the king, Ha&uuml;y had also secured for his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the Academy of Science and Arts and the support of the Philanthropic Society. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and the subsequent disorganization of the Philanthropic Society, Ha&uuml;y's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> lacked its wonted support. Although the National Assembly, and later on the Convention, had declared it a national institution and had voted for it an annual subsidy, yet so scanty was the help accorded to it that it barely survived the Reign of Terror. In 1801, on a report to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> from Chaptal, Minister of the Interior, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was merged with the Hospice Quinze-Vingts. A year later, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> relieved Ha&uuml;y of the direction of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and granted him a pension of 2000 francs. ln February, 1802, Ha&uuml;y started a private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the rue Sainte-Avoye. Through lack of funds, however, the "Mus&eacute;e des Aveugles", his new foundation, never attained much prominence. In 1806, on the invitation of Alexander I, Ha&uuml;y left for St. Petersburg where he founded, in 1808, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind, on the model of the National Institution in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On his way to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Ha&uuml;y had an interview at Charlottenburg with Frederick William III of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. He prevailed upon the king to found an institution for the blind at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, and to appoint Dr. Zeune as its first director. From his arrival at St. Petersburg, 9 Sept., 1806, until his departure, Ha&uuml;y's devotion and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in doing for the blind of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> what he had done for those of his own native country were put to many a severe test, and rewarded with but scanty gratitude. Weakened with age and infirmity, Ha&uuml;y wished to die in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He left St. Petersburg in 1817. On his return to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he went to live with his brother, the Abb&eacute; Ha&uuml;y, in whose arms he peacefully expired.

<p>The publications of Valentin Ha&uuml;y are his "Essai sur l'&eacute;ducation des aveugles" (Paris, 1786), and "M&eacute;moire historique sur les t&eacute;l&eacute;graphes" (Paris, 1810).
