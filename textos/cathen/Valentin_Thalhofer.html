<h1>Valentin Thalhofer</h1>  

<p>German <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Unterroth, near Ulm, 21 January, 1825; d. at the same place, 17 September, 1891. He took his gymnasial studies and philosophy at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, then from 1845 studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the University of Munich. In 1848 he received the degree of Doctor of Theology and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. After this he was prefect at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a> (1850-63), professor of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> at the lyceum of Dillingen (1863-76), director of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Georgianum, at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and professor of liturgy at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, and in 1899 became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> there. He was an able and highly respected teacher, a man of noble character, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> confessor, <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, and catechist, and was a fruitful writer, thorough and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> in his work. His labours at the Georgianum, for which he was highly praised, greatly benefited the institution. His first publication was a prize essay at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> on the bloodless sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> worship (1848). In 1855 he wrote in the report of the Dillingen lyceum for that year, a dissertation on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of sacrifice contained in the Epistle to the Hebrews. In the same year he began a successful opposition to the pseudo-mysticism and <a href="../cathen/08174a.htm">Irvingism</a> which were spreading in Swabia at that time. His chief work in this direction was the "Beitrage zur Geschichte des Aftermysticismus und insbesondere des Irvingianismus im Bistum Augsburg" (1857). His excellent commentary on the Psalms was very popular (first published in 1857; 7th ed., 1904). In 1860-63 he edited the official publication of the Augsburg Diocese and brought it to greater prosperity. Among the literary work done during his residence at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> should be mentioned his editing of a "Library of the Fathers" in eighty volumes (1869-88); a work on the sacrifice of the Old and New Covenants (1870); and the editing of the "Lehrbuch der biblishen Hermeneutik" of his deceased friend Franz Xavier Reithmayr (1874). At Eichst&auml;tt he was commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to revise the "Rituale Romano-Eystettense", and in addition issued a smaller ritual as a manual for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (1879-80). He then began his chief work, a large "Handbuch der Liturgik" which rests on a thorough study of the original authorities and is still indispensable. Of the special <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, he published himself in 1890 the "Liturgie des heiligen Messopfers", and from the papers of the deceased Andreas Schmid he added to this in 1893 the "Liturgie des kirchlichen Stundengebetes", the "Liturgie der Sakramente und Sakramentalien", and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the church year. Adalbert Ebner began a revised edition of this work, but unfortunately no more has been published than the fist section of the first volume (1894). Schmid also edited from Thalhofer's literary remains "Die heilige Messe und das Priestertum der katholischen Kirche in 25 Predigten dargestellt" (1893). In addition to these larger works Thalhofer also wrote excellent articles for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> reviews and for the "Kirchenlexikon" of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>.
