<h1>Valentinian I</h1>  

<p>(FLAVIUS VALENTINIANUS).

<p>Emperor of the West, 364-75. Born at Cibalis (probably Mikanovici), Pannonia, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, in 321; d. at Bregetio, near Pressburg, 17 Nov., 375. He entered the army early, became a tribune of the scutarii about 360, and accompanied <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, whence in 464 he was exiled to Gaul for refusing to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> idols. On Jovian's death Valentinian was proclaimed emperor (26 Feb., 364), and at once he appointed his brother <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> ruler of the East. In 265 he went again to Gaul to stop the inroads of the Alammani and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>; the former were defeated at Charpeigne and Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne, but in 367 captured <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. A little later they were overthrown by Valentinian at Solicinium, but with heavy Roman losses. In 374 Valentinian concluded a treaty with their king Macrianus. In 368 the Picts and Scots were driven back from Britain, and the province of Valentia formed. While in Gaul Valentinian repudiated his first wife Valeria Severa, or at least he married a <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a>, Justina, who became the mother of <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian II</a>. In June, 374, the emperor was called to Illyricum by the incursions of the Quadi and Sarmatians; he made his headquarters at Bregetio, where during the negotiations with the Quadi he died from apoplexy. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at Constantinople.

<p>Though a sincere <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, Valentinian generally abstained from interfering in religious questions, unless public interests forced him to act; probably in his endeavours to observe impartiality, he bestowed more favours on the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>; his conduct contrasted strongly with that of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> who ardently supported the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. Valentinian revoked <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian's</a> edict, which forbade <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to teach. He prohibited nocturnal sacrificial practices and magic, probably because they were causes of public disorder, for at the request of Praetextatus, proconsul of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, he tolerated the mysteries of Eleusis and in 371 declared <em>haruspicia</em> legal. Constantius had formerly applied the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches, and <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> had given the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, but Valentinian claimed all this transferred <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, possibly from a desire of wealth, as well as from a wish to be impartial to all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and also to reduce public taxation. He restored the cross and the name of Christ to the <em>labarum</em> from which <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> had removed them, supported Pope Damasus against Ursinus in the dispute concerning the papal election, forbade judicial proceedings on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, exempted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldiers from guarding <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from being made gladiators. On the other hand, he increased the privileges of the provincial <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> (as the old Roman religion now began to be called), restricted the right of asylum, forbade the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">Christian clergy</a> to receive legacies from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> unless they were their heirs; though no corresponding restriction was placed on <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Moreover, lest the wealthy should become <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to enjoy <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> immunity, he prohibited them form receiving orders unless they first renounced their patrimony; but he ordered <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be tried by their peers. The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> he considered political disturbers and in 372 forbade their meetings at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, confiscated their houses, and punished their teachers. He supported the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Auxentius, when <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> him to be <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>; however, he confirmed the decrees of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> (375) against he <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachians</a> and addressed a special letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, ordering the homousian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity to be taught, notwithstanding, as he said, the example and practice of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>; but his untimely end prevented him from enforcing his instructions on this point. Valentinian was affable and kind, but vain; he was a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a>, skilful soldier, and was ready to profess his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> openly when called upon; he wished to restore matters to the condition in which Constantine had left them, but in doing so abstained from emphasizing his own views; his legislative activity was very great, not the least interesting of his edicts being one in 368, by which he appointed fourteen physicians at rome to care for the poor at the public expense.
