<h1>Valentinian II</h1>  

<p>(FLAVIUS VALENTINIANUS)

<p>Reigned 375-392; born in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, about 371, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Vienne, Dauphiny, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, 15 May, 392. Son of Valentinian I and his second wife Justina. He was never much more than a merely nominal ruler, for while Gratian ruled in the East, most of the West was under the control of Magnus Maximus. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was all that was left to him, and even there the real ruler was his mother Justina, with whom he resided at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. In 387 Maximus, who had usurped the northern provinces in 383, invaded <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Justina and Valentinian fled to Thessalonica to seek the aid of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, Emperor of the East. Maximus was defeated, but Justina soon died, and Valentinian fell under the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence of Arbogast, who had him assassinated later. Valentinian was weak, but just, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> peace. Justina was opposed to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party; she endeavoured to set up an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and to procure a church for his followers, but was thwarted by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, who protested that the churches belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> not to the emperor. And when the Roman senate attempted in 384 and 391 to restore the altar of victory and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rites, it was St. Ambrose again who triumphed. On 23 January, 386, Valentinian published an edict protecting the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> supporters of the <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Council of Ariminum</a>, but this was overruled by <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>. On the other hand he supported Pope Damasus against his enemy Ursinus. With Gratian he reaffirmed the exemption of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the civil tribunals in religious matters. In 386 he issued an edict for the erection of the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">Basilica of St. Paul</a> and directed Sallust, the prefect of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to co-operate with Pope Siricus in this matter. The basilica was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 390. After Justina's death Valentinian abandoned <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, and invited St. Ambrose to come to Gaul to administer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to him, but was not spared to receive it. His body was brought to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> delivered his funeral oration, "De obitu Valentiniani consolatio", in which he dwells on the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of desire (P.L., XVI).
