<h1>Valentinian III</h1>  

<p>Reigned 425-55, b. at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, 3 July, 419; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 16 March, 455; son of Constantius III and Galla Placidia, daughter of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, succeeded <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a>. In 437 he married his cousin Eudoxia at Constantinople. During his reign the Western Empire hastened to decay. Britain was abandoned in 446, &AElig;tius failed to hold Gaul against the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, and Huns, while Africa was lost in 439 by Boniface, who was defeated by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> under Huneric, later married to Valetinian's daughter Eudoxia. On 17 July, 425, all schismatics were ordered to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; in the same year the immunity of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> was reaffirmed, though Valentinian abrogated this privilege later in 452; on 8 April, 4236, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were forbidden to disinherit their children who became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Valentinian was a strong adversary of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> and in 445 declared them guilty of sacrilege, forbade them to reside in cities, and pronounced them incapable of performing any judicial acts. When appealed to by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> in the dispute with <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a> concerning the latter's <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, he addressed a constitution to &AElig;tius, Governor of Gaul, strongly supporting Leo. In it he emphasized the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy, founded on the position of St. Peter as head of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, and pointed out the necessity of one supreme head for the spiritual kingdom, and ordered the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> to bring to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who refused to come there when called by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 447 he issued an edict to prevent the violation of sepulchres. He was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with his wife and mother, in February, 450, for the celebration of the feast of the Chair of St. Peter, and after consultation with Pope Leo took active steps for the calling of a general Council, which met at Chalcedon in October, 451. Valentinian presented <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Xystus III</a> with 2000 lbs. of silver to construct a tabernacle in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a>, and in addition with a large golden ornament representing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his Apostles, for the Confessio of St. Peter. As he grew older Valentinian displayed a vindictive, feeble, hesitating character; his training seems to have been purposely neglected by his mother, the real ruler. On the approach of <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a> he fled from <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, his imperial residence, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which was saved later, as is known by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope St. Leo</a>. After his mother's death (450), he gave way to his passions. In 454 he caused &AElig;tius and his friends to be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>; at last he was assassinated while attending the chariot races in the Via Labicana, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Helena, at the instigation, it is said, of a Roman senator, Petronius Maximus, whose wife he had wronged.
