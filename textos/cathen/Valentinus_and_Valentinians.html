<h1>Valentinus and Valentinians</h1>  

<p>Valentinus, the best known and most influential of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, was born according to Epiphanius (Haer., XXXI) on the coast of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. He was trained in Hellenistic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Like many other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teachers he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the better, perhaps to disseminate his views. He arrived there during the pontificate of Hyginus and remained until the pontificate of Anicetus. During a sojourn of perhaps fifteen years, though he had in the beginning allied himself with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> community in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was guilty of attempting to establish his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> system. His <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> led to his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, after which he repaired to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> where he resumed his activities as a teacher and where he died probably about 160 or 161. Valentinus professed to have derived his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> from Theodas or Theudas, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, but his system is obviously an attempt to amalgamate Greek and Oriental speculations of the most fantastic kind with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. He was especially indebted to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. From him was derived the parallel between the ideal world (the <em>pleroma</em>) and the lower world of phenomena (the <em>kenoma</em>). Valentinus drew freely on some books of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, but used a strange system of interpretation by which the sacred authors were made responsible for his own <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmological</a> and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> views. In working out his system he was thoroughly dominated by <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> fancies.

<p>He assumed, as the beginning of all things, the Primal Being or <em>Bythos</em>, who after ages of silence and contemplation, gave rise to other beings by a process of emanation. The first series of beings, the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a>, were thirty in number, representing fifteen syzygies or pairs sexually complementary. Through the weakness and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Sophia, one of the lowest <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a>, the lower world with its subjection to matter is brought into existence. Man, the highest being in the lower world, participates in both the psychic and the hylic (material) nature, and the work of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> consists in freeing the higher, the spiritual, from its servitude to the lower. This was the word and mission of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Holy Spirit. The <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> of Valentinus is confusing in the extreme. He seems to have maintained the existence of three redeeming beings, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the Son of Mary did not have a real body and did not suffer. The system of Valentinus was extremely comprehensive, and was worked out to cover all phases of thought and action. While Valentinus was alive he made many disciples, and his system was the most widely diffused of all the forms of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. His <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was divided into two branches, the Oriental and the Italian. The former was spread through <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, the latter in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Southern Gaul. Among the more prominent disciples of Valentinus, who, however, did not slavishly follow their master in all his views, were Heracleon, Ptolemy, Marcos, and <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>. Many of the writings of these <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, and a large number of excerpts from the writings of Valentinus, are still in existence. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> ascribes to him the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Gospel of Valentinus, which, according to <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, was the same as the "Gospel of Truth".
