<h1>Valerian</h1>  

<p>(Publius Aurelius Licinius Valerianus).

<p>Roman emperor (253-60). Member of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he had held several offices before the army proclaimed him emperor in 253 at <a href="../cathen/13018b.htm">Rhaetia</a>. Weak and irresolute, his abilities were unequal to the difficulties of the times; his son and coregent, <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a>, was lacking also in force. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> regards him as the originator of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>. Though kindly disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as emperor he was driven to in severe measures by the hostile party, whose leader, the general Macrianus, aimed only to gain advantages for himself through the difficulties internal disturbances would cause the emperor. In 257 Valerian issued a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>, in kindly language, taking from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to hold assemblies or to enter the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">subterranean places of burial</a>, and sending the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> into exile. In 258, by a new and absolutely merciless edict, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were executed immediately, men of senatorial and equestrian rank were punished with degradation and confiscation of goods to be followed by death if they refused to offer <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> sacrifice, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were threatened with confiscation of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and exile, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the imperial household were sent in chains to perform forced labour on the imperial domains. In this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Christian Rome</a> and Carthage lost their leaders: <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Pope Sixtus</a> was seized on 6 August, 258, in one of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> and was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian of Carthage</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> on 14 September. Another celebrated <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was the Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> Bishop <a href="../cathen/06311b.htm">Fructuosus of Tarragona</a> and his two <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> on 21 January, 259. There were also executions in the eastern provinces (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VII, xii). Taken altogether, however, the repressions were limited to scattered spots and had no great success. Valerian was finally captured by the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> and died a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Macrianus and his two sons were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> in the struggle for the throne. Gallienus, who became Valerian's successor, annulled at once all his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> hostile to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.
