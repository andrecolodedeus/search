<h1>Valliscaulian Order</h1>  

<p>("Vallis Caulium", or "Val-des-Choux", the name of the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of that order, in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>).

<p>Founded towards the end of the twelfth century by Viard, a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Loubigny, in the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a>. Viard was permitted by his superior to lead the life of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> in a cavern in a wood, where he gained by his life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and austerity the reputation of a saint. The Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the site of the hermitage; Viard became prior in 1193, and framed rules for the new foundation drawn partly from the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> and partly from the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> observance. The order of the "Brethren of the Cabbage- Valley" was formally confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, on 12 February, 1265, in a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> preserved in one of the Scottish houses) in the Register of Moray, and entitled "Protectio Apostolica". In the same year Odo III, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, gave the brethren a large grant of forest land round the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, which was further endowed by the Duke's successors, by the Bishops of Langres, and other benefactors. <a href="../cathen/07214a.htm">H&eacute;lyot</a> states, on the authority of Chopin (Traite des droits religieux et des monastres, II, tit. i, no. 20), that there were thirty dependent houses of the order, but he names of only twenty are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Seventeen of these were in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the principal one being at Val-Croissant, in the <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Diocese of Autun</a>; and the remaining three were in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. References in the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of 1268 and elsewhere show that <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of the order existed also in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. A complete list of the priors-general has been preserved, from the founder Viard (also styled Guido), who died after 1213, to Doroth&eacute;e Jallontz, who was also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> house of Sept-Fons, and was the last grand-prior of Val-des-Choux before the absorption of the Valliscaulian brotherhood into the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>. In the middle of the eighteenth century there were but three inmates of the mother-house; the revenues had greatly diminished, and there had been no profession in the order for twenty-four years. Gilbert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, strongly urged the remaining members to unite with the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, whose rule they had originally, in great part, adopted. The proposal was agreed to, the change was authorized by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> in 1764, and Val-des-Choux was formally incorporated with Sept-Fons in March, 1764, the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> having previously ratified the arrangement. For the next quarter of a century the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> flourished under its new conditions; but it was swept away in the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution of 1789</a>, with the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Of the three Scottish houses of the order, Ardchattan, Beauly, and <a href="../cathen/12171a.htm">Pluscarden</a>, the first two became <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>, and the third a cell of the <a href="../cathen/05192a.htm">Benedictine Abbey of Dunfermline</a>, a century before the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/01700a.htm">THE PRIORY OF ARDCHATTAN</a>; <a href="../cathen/12171a.htm">PLUSCARDEN PRIORY</a>).
