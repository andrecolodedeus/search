<h1>Vancouver</h1>  

<p>(VANCOUVERIENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a>; includes that part of the mainland of the Province of <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a> south of 54 &#176; N. lat. and west of the Straits of Georgia, together with the Queen Charlotte Islands. It comprises about 150,000 square miles. The first resident of what is now <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a> was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and so were the great explorers, Simon Fraser and his lieutenant, J.M. <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>. The numerous <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the service of the Hudson Bay Company gave the natives their first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Later on, <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet</a> visited the Kootenays. In 1843 <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Father Demers</a> had made an extensive trip through the inland lakes, visiting in turn the Okanagans, the Shuswaps, and the Carriers. In 1843 this district was included in the Vicariate Apostolic of Columbia, under <a href="../cathen/02593b.htm">Rt. Rev. A. Blanchet</a>, titulary. Three years later a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Nobili, went as far north as Bahine Lake. In 1847 <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Rt. Rev. M. Demers</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vancouver Island, called the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, already working in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, to the mainland of <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>. These missionaries founded a mission in Okanagan in 1859. About this time, immediately after the discovery of gold in the Cariboo district, the city of New Westminster was founded on the estuary of the Fraser, and here the Oblates organized a central mission in 1860, followed by St. Mary's Mission, 60 miles inland, in 1863, from which they evangelized the lower Fraser Indians and the Sechelts and the Aquamish of the coast.

<p>Father L.J. D'Herbomez, O.M.I., was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Melitopolis, 9 October, 1864, and appointed to the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a> which included the mainland from 49 degrees to 60 degrees N. lat. In 1867 he established a mission 300 miles north of New Westminster at William's Lake, for twenty-two reserves of Shuswp, Chilcotin, and Carrier Indians, and in 1873 another mission, 600 miles north, at Stuart's Lake, for thirteen villages of Babines, Sekanais, Nahanais, and Skeenas. In 1876 the Kootenay mission at the foot of the Rockies was founded for thirteen bands of Kootenays and Okanagan, and in 1878, Kamloops Mission, 250 miles east of New Westminster, was established for twelve villages of Nicolas, Shuswaps, and Thompsons. To meet the needs of the influx of eastern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, Americans, and British, a pro-cathedral was built in 181 at new Westminster, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in 1866, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in charge of the Sisters of Providence, and an academy for girls in charge of the Sisters of St. Ann. In twenty-five years Bishop D'Herbomez, assisted by pioneer Oblates, mostly from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, completed the conversion of all the tribes of the coast and interior, built <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> for each band, and established three industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>At the death of Bishop D'Herbomez, 3 June, 1890, Rt. Rev. Paul Durieu, O.M.I., who had been appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Marcopolis and coadjutor, 24 October, 1875, took charge. The vicariate was made the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of New Westminster by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 2 September, 1890. The regime of Bishop Durieu was characterized by a rare insight and Apostolic gifts; his strict discipline enabled the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> to resist the contaminating influence of the invading logger and miner, to a degree that makes their annals reminiscent of the early ages of the Faith. In the nine years of his episcopate, churches were built in the mining districts at Fernie, Cranbrook, Greenwood, Nelson, Revelstoke, Sandon, Rossland, and also at Vernon, Lumby, and Kelowna. In 1887 he erected a church, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in charge of the Sisters of Providence, and St. Ann's Academy, in the growing railroad-terminal city of Vancouver. Father Augustin Dontenwill, O.M.I, b. at Bishwiller, Strasbourg, 4 June, 1857, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 30 May, 1885, professor in the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">Faculty of Arts</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11352b.htm">University of Ottawa</a>, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06475b.htm">Germanicopolis</a> and coadjutor, 22 Aug., 1897, succeeding to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, 1 June, 1899. He carried on the work of his predecessor, giving special attention to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> needs, and established a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly, a Children's Aid Society, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> in charge of the Sisters of Providence, an academy at Nelson, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Greenwood and Rossland in charge of the sisters of St. Joseph of Peace. He also erected a monumental church at Vancouver and three <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches in the suburbs.

<p>On 25 June, 1903, a separate <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> was formed in <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, with Victoria as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, and Most Rev. Bertram Orth was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 Sept., 1908, that part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> north of 54 &#176; N. lat., exclusive of the Queen Charlotte Islands, was added to the Yukon Vicariate, and Bishop Dontenwill was appointed first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vancouver, Victoria reverting to the status of suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On 29 Sept., 1908, he was elected Superior General of the Oblate Congregation and resigned the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, 21 Sept., 1908, being appointed later titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Ptolemais, and since then resident at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Rt. Rev. Neil McNeil, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13351a.htm">St. George's</a>, <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, was transferred to the See of Vancouver and raised to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> dignity, January, 1910. Since his arrival in Vancouver, six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches and five mission <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> have been erected, and the Religious of the Sacred Heart placed in charge of the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls in Vancouver. Archbishop McNeil was born in Hillsborough, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, 23 Nov., 1851. He is a son of the late Malcolm McNeil and Ellen Meagher, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> College, <a href="../cathen/01562c.htm">Antigonish</a>, and in 1873 sent to the College of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1879, joined the teaching staff of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> College in 1880, became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college in 1884, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11079a.htm">Nilopolis</a> and Vicar-Apostolic of St. George's Newfoundland, in 1891. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/01562c.htm">Antigonish</a>, 20 October, 1895.
