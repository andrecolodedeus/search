<h1>Vandals</h1>  

<p>A Germanic people belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of East Germans. According to Tacitus, they were originally settled between the Elbe and Vistula. At the time of the War of the Marcomanni (166-81) they lived in what is now Silesia, and in about 271 the Roman Emperor <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to protect the middle course of the Danube against them. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> (about 330) granted them lands in Pannonia on the right bank of the Danube. Through the <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Emperor Valens</a> (364-78) they accepted <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian Christianity</a>, yet there were also some scattered <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Vandals, among whom was Stilicho the minister of the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a>. In 406 the Vandals advanced from Pannonia by way of Gaul, which they devastated terribly, into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where they settled in 411. From 427 their king was Genseric (Gaiseric), who in 429 landed in North Africa with about 80,000 of his followers. It is a disputed point whether or not he was called to Africa by the Roman governor Boniface on account of the intrigues of A&euml;tius. Peace was made between the Romans and Vandals in 435 but it was broken by Genseric in 439, who made Carthage his capital after he had thoroughly plundered it. During the next thirty-five years with a large fleet he ravaged the coasts of the Eastern and Western Empires. In 455 he plundered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself during two weeks. It is asserted that the Empress Eudoxia had asked him to free her from her <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> marriage with the Emperor Petronius Maximus, the murderer of her husband <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a>. This story, however, is probably a fable. It is said that on 2 June, 455, <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> received Genseric and implored him to abstain from <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and destruction by fire, and to be satisfied with pillage. Whether the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> influence saved <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is, however, questioned; moreover, the Vandals had only booty in mind, nor was the plundering as extreme as later tradition and the expression "Vandalism" would imply. From 462 the Vandal kingdom included Africa and the islands of the Mediterranean, that is <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, and the Balearic Islands, but like the other Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil the kingdom of the Vandals in Africa began to decay from the lack of unity of religion and of race among the two populations.

<p>The Vandals treated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> more harshly than other German peoples. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were punished by Genseric with deposition, exile, or death, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were excluded from office and frequently suffered confiscation of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. It is said of Genseric himself that he was originally a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and had changed to <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> about 428; this, however, is probably an invention. He protected his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects when his relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Constantinople were friendly, as during the years 454-57, when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, being without a head, elected Deogratias <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The same was also the case during the years 476-77 when Bishop Victor of Cartenna sent him, during a period of peace, a sharp refutation of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and suffered no punishment. Genseric was one of the most powerful personalities of the era of the Migrations, and was the terror of the seas. He died at a great age on 25 January, 477. According to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of succession which he had <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, not the son but the oldest male member of the royal house was to succeed to the throne (law of seniority). He was succeeded by his incompetent son Hunerich (477- 484), who at first protected the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, owing to his fear of Constantinople, but from 482 he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them in the most terrible manner. King Guntamund (484-96), his cousin and successor, protected them once more, and while Thrasamund (496-523), owing to his religious fanaticism, was hostile to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, still he contented himself with bloodless persecutions. Hilderich (523-30) favoured the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and granted religious freedom; consequently <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were once more held in North Africa. Hilderich's policy was opposed by his cousin Gelimer, who raised the banner of national <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Hilderich was deposed and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 533. This was taken as an excuse for interference by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian. Gelimer was defeated in 533 and 534 by Belisarius, the commander of the armies of the Eastern Empire, and North Africa became a Roman province, from which the Vandals were expelled. Gelimer was honourably treated and received large estates in Galicia. He was also offered the rank of a patrician but had to refuse it because he was not willing to change his <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
