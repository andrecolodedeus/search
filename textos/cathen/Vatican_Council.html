<h1>Vatican Council</h1>  

<p>The Vatican Council, the twentieth and up to now [1912] the last ecumenical council, opened on 8 December, 1869, and adjourned on 20 October, 1870. It met three hundred years after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Introductory history</h2>
<h3 id="A">Previous to the official convocation</h3>

<p>On 6 December, 1864, two days before the publication of the Syllabus, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> announced, at a session of the Congregation of Rites, his intention to call a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. He commissioned the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> residing at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to express in writing their views as to the opportuneness of the scheme, and also to name the subjects which, in their opinion, should be laid before the council for discussion. Of the twenty-one reports sent in, only one, that of Cardinal Pentini, expressed the opinion that there was no occasion for the holding of an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>. The others affirmed the relative necessity of such an assembly, although five did not consider the time suitable. Nearly all sent lists of questions that seemed to need <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> discussion. Early in March, 1865, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed a commission of five <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to discuss preliminary questions in regard to the council. This was the important "Congregazione speziale direttrice per gli affari del futuro concilio generale", generally called the directing preparatory commission, or the central commission. Four more <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were added to the number of its members, and besides a secretary it was given eight consultors. It held numerous meetings in the interval between 9 March, 1865, and Dec., 1869. Its first motion was that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of various countries should also be called upon for suggestions as to matters for discussion, and on 27 March, 1865, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> commanded thirty-six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> designated by him to express their views under pledge of silence. Early in 1866 he also designated several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Oriental Rite under the same conditions. It was now <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to form commissions for the more thorough discussion of the subjects to be debated at the council. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, were summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the various countries to co-operate in the work. As early as 1865 the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> were asked to suggest names of suitable people for these preliminary commissions. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1866 and the withdrawal of the French troops from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 11 Dec. of the same year caused an unwelcome interruption of the preparatory labours. They also made the original plan, which was to open the council on the eighteenth centenary festiva of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the two great Apostles, 29 June, 1867, impossible. However, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> made use of the presence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of nearly five hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who had come to attend the centennial celebration, to make the first public announcement of the council at a consistory held on 26 June, 1867. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> expressed their agreement with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in an address <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 July. After the return of the French army of protection on 30 Oct., 1867, the continuance of the preparations and the holding of the council itself seemed again possible. The preparatory commission now debated exhaustively the question who should be invited to attend the council. That the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be summoned was self-evident. It was also decided that the <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be called, and that of the heads of the orders an invitation should be given to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> <em>nullius</em>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> general of congregations formed from several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and lastly, to the generals of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. It was considered wiser, on account of the state of affairs at the time, not to send an actual invitation to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes, yet it was intended to grant admission to them or their representatives on demand. In this sense, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Convocation, "&AElig;terni Patris", was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, 29 June, 1868; it appointed 8 Dec., 1869, as the date for the opening of the council. The objects of the council were to be the correction of modern <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and a seasonable revision of the legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, "Arcano divin&aelig; providenti&aelig;", of 8 Sept., 1868 invited <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">non-Uniate Orientals</a> to appear. A third <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, "Jam vos omnes", of 13 Sept., 1868, notified <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> also of the convoking of the council, and exhorted them to use the occasion to reflect on the return to the one household of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
<h3 id="B">Reception of the promulgation</h3>

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> convoking the council was received with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by the bulk of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> masses, it aroused much discontent in many places, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In these countries it was feared that the council would <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> an exact determination of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. The dean of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Bishop Maret, wrote in opposition to these doctrines the work "Du concile g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et de la paix religieuse" (2 vols., <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1869). <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Bishop Dupanloup of Orl&eacute;ans</a> published the work "Observations sur la controverse soulev&eacute;e relativement &agrave; la d&eacute;finition de l infaillibilit&eacute; au prochain concile" (Paris, Nov., 1869). Maret's work was answered by several <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a>. <a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Archbishop Dechamps</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, who had written a work in favour of the definition entitled "L infaillibilit&eacute; et le concile g&eacute;n&eacute;rale" (Paris, 1869), became involved in a controversy with <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Dupanloup</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> a book entitled "The Condemnation of Pope Honorius" (London, 1868), written by the convert, Le Page Renouf, aroused animated discussions in newspapers and periodicals. Renouf's publication was refuted by Father Botalla, S.J., in "Honorius Reconsidered with Reference to Recent Apologies" (London, 1869). Letters from French correspondents in the first number for Feb., 1869, of the "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica", which stated that the majority of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> desired the declaration of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, added fresh fuel to the flames. In particular, it led to the appearance in the discussion of Ignaz <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Cajetan and professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. From now onwards <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> was the leading spirit of the movement in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> hostile to the council. He disputed most passionately the Syllabus and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> in five anonymous articles that were published in March, 1869, in the "Allgemeine Zeitung" of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. A large number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars opposed him vigorously, especially after he published his articles in book form under the pseudonym of "Janus", "Der Papst und das Konzil" (Leipzig, 1869). Among these was <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Professor Joseph Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, who issued in reply "Anti-Janus" (Freiburg, 1870). Still the excitement over the matter grew in such measure that fourteen of the twenty-two German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who met at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> early in Sept., 1869, felt themselves constrained to call the attention of the Holy Father to it in a special address, stating that on account of the excitement the time was not opportune for defining <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> notifications addressed to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Orientals and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> did not produce the desired effect. The <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Governments received from Prince Hohenlohe, president of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> ministry, a circular letter drawn up by <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, designed to prejudice the different Courts against the coming council; but they decided to remain neutral for the time being. <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> alone forbade its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to attend the council.


<h3 id="C">Preparatory details</h3>

<p>In the meantime <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> work had been done at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in preparation for the council. Besides the general direction that it exercised, the preparatory commission had to draw up an exhaustive order of procedure for the debates of the council. Five special committees, each presided over by a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and having together eighty-eight consultors, prepared the plan (<em>schemata</em>) to be laid before the council. These committees were appointed to consider respectively: <ul> <li><a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; <li>church discipline; <li>orders; <li>Oriental Churches and missions; <li>ecclesiastico-political questions. </ul> It may justly be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether the preliminary preparations for any council had ever been made more thoroughly, or more clearly directed to the aim to be attained. As the day of its opening approached, the following drafts were ready for discussion: <ul> <li>three great dogmatic drafts, (a) on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which frequently spring from <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, (b) on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ and, (c) on <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a>; <li>twenty-eight drafts treating matters of church discipline. They had reference to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, the different grades of the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, the arrangement of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, sermons, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, rituals, impediments to marriage, <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a>, <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, improvement of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, feast days, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and abstinences, <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duelling</a>, magnetism, spiritualism, <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>, etc.; <li>eighteen drafts of decrees had reference to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; <li>two were on the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> and missions; these subjects had also been considered in the other drafts of decrees. </ul> In addition a large number of subjects for discussion had been sent by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of various countries. Thus, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the church provinces of Quebec and Halifax demanded the lessening of the impediments to marriage, revision of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and, above all, the reform and codification of the entire canon law. The petition of Archbishop Spalding of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> treated, among other things, the relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">religious indifference</a>, <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a>. The definition of this last was demanded by various <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Others desired a revision of the index of forbidden books. No less than nine petitions bearing nearly two hundred signatures demanded the definition of the bodily Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. Over three hundred fathers of the council requested the elevation of St. Joseph as <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the Universal Church.
<h2 id="section2">Proceedings of the council</h2>
<h3 id="A">Presiding officers, order of procedure, number of members</h3>

<p>On 2 Dec., 1869, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held a preliminary session in the Sistine Chapel, which was attended by about five hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. At this assembly the officials of the council were announced and the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> procedure was made known. The council received five presidents. The Chief presiding officer was to have been <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Cardinal Reisach</a>, but as he died on 22 Dec., Cardinal Filippo de Angelis took his place, 3 Jan., 1870. The other presiding officers were Cardinals Antonio de Luca, Andrea Bizarri, Aloisio Bilio, and Annibale Capalti. <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Bishop Joseph Fessler</a> of Sankt P&ouml;lten, Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, was secretary to the council, and Monsignor Luigi Jacobi under-secretary. The Constitution "Multiplices inter" announcing the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> procedure contained ten paragraphs. According to this the sessions of the council were to be of two kinds: private sessions for discussing the drafts and motions, under the presidency of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> president, and public sessions, presided over by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself for the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the decrees of the council. The first drafts of decrees debated were to be the dogmatic and disciplinary ones laid before the assembly by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Proposals offered by members of the council were to be sent to a congregation of petitions; these petitions or postulates were to be examined by the committee and then recommended to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for admission or not. If the draft of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was found by the general congregation to need amendments, it was sent with the proposed amendments to the respective sub-committee or <em>deputatio</em>, either to the one for <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> or for discipline, or <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, or for <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a>. Each of these four sub-committees or deputations was to consist of twenty-four <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> selected from the members of the council, and a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> president appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The deputation examined the proposed amendments, altered the draft as seemed best, and presented to the general congregation a printed report on its work that was to be orally explained by a member of the deputation. This procedure was to continue until the draft met with the approval of the majority.

<p>The voting in the congregation was by <em>placet, placet juxta modum</em> (with the corresponding amendments), and <em>non placet</em>. Secrecy was to be observed in regard to the proceedings of the council. In the public sessions the voting could only be by <em>placet</em> or <em>non placet</em>. The Decrees <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were to bear the title, "Pius Episcopus, servus servorum Dei: sacro approbante Concilio ad perpetuam rei memoriam". The northern right <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> of St. Peter's was arranged as the hall of sessions. Between 8 Dec., 1869, and 1 Sept., 1870, four public sessions and eighty-nine general congregations were held here. There were in the entire world approximately one thousand and fifty <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> entitled to take part in the council, and of these no less than seven hundred and seventy-four appeared during the course of the proceedings. In attendance at the first public session were 47 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 9 <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, 117 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 479 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> <em>nullius</em>, 9 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> general, and 25 generals of orders, making a total of 698. At the third public session votes were cast by 47 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 9 <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, 107 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 456 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 1 administrator Apostolic, 20 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and 20 generals of orders, a total of 667. There was an attendance at the council from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a> of all of the 7 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of that time, 37 of the 47 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and in addition 2 <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. The oldest member of the council was <a href="../cathen/09499a.htm">Archbishop MacHale</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; the youngest, Bishop (now <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Gibbons.
<h3 id="B">From the formal opening to the definition of the constitution on the Catholic faith in the third public session</h3>

<p><em>(1) The First Debates</em>

<p>After the formal opening of the council by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at the first public session on 8 Dec., 1869, the meetings of the general congregation began on 10 Dec. Their sessions were generally held between the hours of nine and one. The afternoons were reserved for the sessions of the deputations or sub-committees. First, the names of the members of the congregation of petitions were communicated; this was followed by the elections to the four deputations. The first matter brought up for debate was the dogmatic draft of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> against the manifold <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> due to <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, "De doctrina catholica contra multiplices errores ex rationalismo derivatos". The discussion of it was taken up on 28 Dec. in the fourth general congregation. After a debate lasting seven days, during which thirty-five members spoke, it was sent by the tenth general congregation held on 10 Jan., 1870, to the deputation on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for revision. There had been held in the meantime on 6 Jan. the second public session. This had been previously determined upon, on 26 Oct., 1869, by the central commission for the making of the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the members of the council. The subjects discussed from the tenth to the twenty-ninth meeting of the general congregation (on 22 Feb.) were the drafts of four disciplinary decrees, namely, on <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and on the smaller Catechism. Finally they were all sent for further revision to the deputation on discipline.

<p><em>(2) The Parties</em>

<p>Such slow progress of the work had probably not been expected. The reason of the disagreeable delay was to be found in the question of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a>, which had called forth much excitement even before the council. Directly after the opening of the session its influence was evident in the election of the deputations. It divided the fathers of the council into two, it might almost be said hostile camps; on all occasions the decisions and modes of action of each of these parties were determined by its attitude to this question. On account of the violent disputes which had been carried on everywhere for the past year over the question of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> the overwhelming majority considered the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> discussion and decision of the question to be imperatively <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. On the other hand the minority, comprising about one-fifth of the total number, feared the worst from the definition, the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> of many wavering <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, an increased estrangement of those separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and interference with the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the Governments of the different countries. The minority, therefore, allowed itself to be guided by opportunist considerations. Only a few <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appear to have had <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> itself. Both parties sought to gain the victory for their opinions. As however the minority was soon <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize its powerlessness, it endeavoured by protracting the discussions of the council at least to delay, or even to prevent, a decision as long as possible. Most of the German and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> members of the council were against the definition, as well as nearly half of the American and about one-third of the French fathers. About 7 of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 2 each of the English and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> North America, and 1 <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Greith</a>, belonged to the minority. While only a few <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> opposed the definition, most of the Chaldean and Greek <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> sided with the minority. It had no opponents among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and Central and South America. The most prominent members of the minority from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> were <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Kenrick</a> of St. Louis and <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Purcell</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, and Bishop V&eacute;rot of St. Augustine; these were joined by Archbishop Connolly of <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, Nova Scotia. Prominent members of the majority were Archbishop Spalding of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Bishops Williams of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, Wood of Philadelphia, and Conroy of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>.

<p><em>(3) Change of Procedure: the Hall of Assembly Reduced in Size</em>

<p>Various memorials were now sent the Holy Father petitioning for new rules of debate for the sake of a corresponding progress in the proceedings of the council. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> procedure was more exactly defined by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Apostolicis litteris", issued on 20 Feb., 1870. According to this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a>, any member of the council who wished to raise an objection to the draft under discussion was to send in his proposed amendments in writing, in order that they might be thoroughly considered by the respective deputation. In the general congregation the discussion of a draft as a whole was always to precede the discussion of the individual parts of the draft of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. The members of a deputation received the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to speak in explanation or correction when not on the list of speakers. Speakers who wandered from the subject were to be called back to it. If a subject had been sufficiently debated the president, on the motion of at least ten members of the council, could put the question whether the council desired to continue the discussion or not, and then close the debate at the wish of the majority. Although these rules made for an evident improvement, still the minority was not satisfied with them, especially in so far as they contemplated a possible shortening of the debates. They expressed their dissatisfaction in several petitions which, however, had no success. On the other hand, every effort was made to satisfy another complaint which had reference to the bad acoustics of the council hail. Between 22 Feb. and 18 March, that is between the twenty-ninth and thirtieth sessions of the general congregation, the council hall was reduced about one-third in size for the use of the general congregations, so that the fathers who were thus brought closer together could understand the speakers better. The hall was restored to its original size for each of the public sessions.

<p><em>(4) Completion of the First Constitution</em>

<p>The interruption thus caused was used by the deputation on Faith to revise the draft of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "De doctrina catholica" in accordance with the wishes of the general congregation. On 1 March, Bishop Martin of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> laid before the deputation the first part of the revision, the work of <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Father Joseph Kleutgen, S.J.</a>* It consisted of an introduction and four chapters with the corresponding canons. After an exhaustive discussion in the deputation, it was ready to be distributed to the fathers of the council on 14 March as the actual "Constitutio de fide catholica". A report in writing was also added by the deputation. Archbishop Simor of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> gave the oral report on 18 March in the thirtieth general congregation. The debate began on the same day, and was closed after seventeen sessions on 19 April, in the forty-sixth general congregation. Over three hundred proposed amendments were brought up and discussed. Although many objections were made by both sides, yet the new rules of procedure made possible a relatively smooth course to the debates. The only disturbing incident was the passionate speech of Bishop Strossmayer of <a href="../cathen/04769c.htm">Diakov&aacute;r</a> on 22 March in the thirty-first general congregation; it called forth a storm of indignation from the majority, which finally forced the speaker to leave the tribune. On 24 April, the first Constitution, "De fide catholica", was unanimously adopted in the third public session by the 667 fathers present, and was formally confirmed and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.
<h3 id="C">The question of papal infallibility</h3>

<p><em>(1) Motions calling for and opposing Definition</em>

<p>The opponents of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a> constantly assert that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> convoked the council of the Vatican solely to have <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> proclaimed. Everything else was merely an excuse and for the sake of appearances. This assertion contradicts the actual facts. Not a single one of the numerous drafts drawn up by the preparatory commission bore on <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. Only two of the twenty-one opinions sent in by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Roman cardinals</a> mentioned it. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that a large number of the episcopal memorials recommended the definition, but these were not taken into consideration in the preparations for the council. It was not until the contest over <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> outside of the council grew constantly more violent that various groups of members of the council began to urge <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> discussion of the question of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a>. The first motion for the definition was made on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1869, by <a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Archbishop Dechamps</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. He was supported by all the other <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who presented a formal opinion of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, which culminated in a petition for the definition. The actual petition for the definition was first circulated among the fathers of the council on New Year's Day, 1870. Several petitions from smaller groups also appeared, and the petitions soon received altogether five hundred signatures, although quite a number of the friends of the definition were not among the number of subscribers. Five opposing memorials circulated by the minority finally obtained 136 names. Upon this, early in Feb., the congregation for petitions unanimously, with exception of <a href="../cathen/12660b.htm">Cardinal Rauscher</a>, requested the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to consider the petition for definition. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> was also in favour of the definition. Therefore on 6 March, the draft of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which had been distributed among the fathers on 21 Jan., was given a new twelfth chapter entitled "Romanum Pontificem in rebus fidei et morum definiendis errare non posse" (The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in defining matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>). With this the matter dropped again in the council.

<p><em>(2) The Agitation Outside the Council</em>

<p>The petitions concerning <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a> called forth once more outside the council a large number of pamphlets and innumerable articles in the daily papers and periodicals. About this time the French Oratorian <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Gratry</a> and <a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Archbishop Dechamps</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> opposed each other in controversial pamphlets. A letter published by <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Count Montalembert</a> on 27 Feb., 1870, in which he spoke of an idol which had been erected in the Vatican, attracted much attention. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> gave anxious expression of his fears as to the bad results of the declaration of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a> in a letter written in March, 1870, to his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Ullathorne</a> of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>. The most extreme opponent was Professor <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In his "R&ouml;mische Briefe vom Konzil", published in the "Allgemeine Zeitung" and issued in book form (Munich, 1870), under the pseudonym of "Quirinus", he used information sent him from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by his pupils, Johann Friedrich and Lord Acton. In these letters he did everything he could by distorting and casting <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> upon facts, by scorn and ridicule, to turn the public against the council. This was especially so in an article of 19 Jan., 1870, in which he attacked so severely the address on <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a>, which had just become known, that even <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop Ketteler</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, an old pupil of <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger's</a> and a member of the minority, protested publicly against it. The Governments of the different countries also took measures on the subject of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a>. As soon as the original draft of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "De ecclesia" with its canons was published in the "Allgemeine Zeitung", Count von Beust, Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, sent a protest against it to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 10 Feb., 1870, which said that the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government would forbid and punish the publication of all decrees that were contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the State. The French minister of foreign affairs, Daru, also sent a threatening memorandum on 20 Feb. He demanded the admission of an envoy to the council, and notified the other Governments of his steps in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> declared their agreement with the memorandum. The president of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ministry, <a href="../cathen/16010b.htm">Bismarck</a>, would not change his attitude of reserve, notwithstanding the urgency of von Arnim, the ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 18 April, the leader of the agitation, Count Daru, retired from his post in the ministry. The president of the French ministry, Ollivier, assumed charge of foreign affairs; he was determined to leave the council free.

<p><em>(3) The Debates in the Council</em>

<p>In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the minority in the council had constantly sought to block the matter, and especially to exert influence to this end on Cardinal Bilio, the president of the deputation on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If the members of the majority had not urged the fulfilment with the same perseverance, <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> would never have reached debate. Finally, on 29 April, during the forty-seventh general congregation, the president interrupted the second debate on the smaller Catechism by the announcement that as soon as possible the fathers should receive for examination the draft of a Constitution, "De Romano Pontifice" which would contain the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the primacy and of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a>. For this purpose the deputation on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had altered the eleventh and twelfth chapters of the old draft of the Constitution "De ecclesia". On 9 May it was distributed among the fathers in printed form as the "Constitutio prima de ecclesia", consisting of 4 chapters and 3 canons. For a full month (13 May 13 June) the general debate over the draft as a whole was carried on in fourteen general congregations, and sixty-four, mostly very long, speeches were delivered. The following special debates over the separate chapters and canons lasted more than a month. Not less than a hundred speakers took part in the discussions, which were carried on from 6 June to 13 July, in 22 congregations. Most of the speeches were on the fourth chapter, which treated <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. The most prominent speakers of the minority were: French; <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Darboy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06562a.htm">Ginoulhiac</a>, Maret; German; Hefele, <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Ketteler</a>, Dinkel; Austrian; Raucher, Schwarzenberg, Strossmayer; <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; V&eacute;rot and Connolly. <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of St. Louis, who lost his opportunity to speak by the closing of the general debate, published in pamphlet form his "Concio in concilio habenda, at non habita". On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> speech published under the name of Bishop Strossmayer is a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> perpetrated by an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Augustinian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from Mexico, Jos&eacute; Agostino de Escudero, who was then in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/06725a.htm">Granderath</a>-Kirch III, 189). The majority were chiefly represented by the French members of the council; Pie and <a href="../cathen/06277a.htm">Freppel</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> member, <a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Dechamps</a>; the English member, <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cullen</a>; the Italian members, Gastaldi and Valerga; the Spanish member, Paya y Rico; the Austrian, Gasser; the German members, Martin and Senestrey; the American member, Spalding. Several members of the minority as <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Kenrick</a>, Bauseher, Hefele, Schwarzenberg, and <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Ketteler</a>, discussed the question of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a> in pamphlets that they individually issued, to which naturally the majority were not slow to reply. The most important of these answers was the "Animadversiones of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, <a href="../cathen/15646b.htm">W. Wilmers, S.J.</a>, in which the writings of the last four of the antagonists just mentioned were, in succession, thoroughly confuted. Scarcely in any parliament have important matters ever been subjected to as much discussion as was the question of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> in the Vatican Council in the course of two months all the reasons pro and con had been again and again discussed, and only what had been already often said could now be repeated. Consequently in the eighty-second general congregation held on 4 July, most of those who still had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to speak, not only of the majority, but also of the minority, renounced the privilege, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> president was able, amid general applause, to close the debates.

<p><em>(4) Final Voting and Definition</em>

<p>The time of the eighty-third, eighty-fourth, and eighty-fifth general congregations was almost entirely occupied with the reports of the deputation on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> concerning the last two chapters. The report of Prince Bishop Gasser on the fourth chapter was a very notable one. In the eighty-fifth general congregation held on 13 July a general vote was taken on the entire draft. There were present 601 fathers. Of these 451 voted <em>placet</em>, 62 <em>placet juxta modum</em> (conditional affirmative), 88 <em>non placet</em>. Of the North American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only 7 voted <em>non placet</em>; these were <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Kenrick</a>, V&eacute;rot, Domenec, Fitzgerald, MacQuaid, <a href="../cathen/09488a.htm">MacCloskey</a>, and Mrac. Bishop Fitzgerald still voted <em>non placet</em> in the fourth public session, while on this occasion Bishop Domenec voted <em>placet</em>. The other five did not attend this session. In the eighty-sixth general congregation the fathers condemned, on the motion of the president, two anonymous pamphlets which <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> the council in the coarsest manner. One, entitled "Ce qui se passe au Concile", culminated in the assertion that there was no freedom of discussion at the council. The other, "La derni&egrave;re heure du Concile", repeated all the accusations that the enemies of the council had raised against it, and exhorted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the minority to stand firm and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> vote <em>non placet</em> in the public session. On account of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which threatened to break out between <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, a number of fathers of both opinions had returned home. Shortly before the fourth public session a large number of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the minority left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the permission of the directing officers of the council. They did not oppose the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> itself, but were against its definition as inopportune. On Monday, 18 July, 1870, one day before the outbreak of the Franco-German War, 435 fathers of the council assembled at St. Peter's under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>. The last vote was now taken; 433 fathers voted <em>placet</em>, and only two, Bishop Aloisio Riccio of Cajazzo, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Bishop Edward Fitzgerald of <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a>, <a href="../cathen/01724a.htm">Arkansas</a>, voted <em>non placet</em>. During the proceedings a thunderstorm broke over the Vatican, and amid thunder and lightning the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the new <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, like a <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>.
<h3 id="D">The Council from the fourth public session until the prorogation</h3>

<p>At the close of the eighty-fifth general congregation a "Monitum" was read which announced that the council would be continued without interruption after the fourth public session. Still, the members received a general permission to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for some months. They had only to notify the secretary in writing of their departure. By 11 Nov., St. Martin's day, all were to be back again. So many of the fathers made use of this permission that only a few more than 100 remained at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Naturally these could not take up any new questions. Consequently the draft of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, which had been amended in the meantime by the deputation of discipline, was again brought forward, and debated in three further general congregations. The eighty-ninth, which was also to be the last, was held on 1 Sept. On 8 Sept. the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> troops entered the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> at several points; on Tuesday, 20 Sept., a little before eight o'clock in the morning, the enemy entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> through the Porta Pia. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in the Vatican. He waited a month longer. He then issued on 20 Oct. the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Postquam Dei munere", which prorogued the council indefinitely. This day was the day after a <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> had been issued organizing the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of Peter</a> as a Roman province. A circular letter issued by the Italian minister, Visconti Venosta, on 22 Oct., to assure the council of the freedom of meeting, naturally met with no credence. A very remarkable letter was sent from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> on the same day by Archbishop Spalding to Cardinal Barnabo, prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In this letter he made the proposition, which met the approval of <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a>, <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Archbishop Dechamps</a>, to continue the council in the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> city of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, and gave ten reasons why this city seemed suitable for such sessions. Unfortunately the general condition of affairs was such that a continuation of the council even at the most suitable place could not be thought of.
<h2 id="section3">Acceptance of the decrees of the council</h2>

<p>After the council had made its decision everyone naturally looked with interest to those members of the minority who had maintained their opposition to the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a> up to the last moment. Would they recognize the decision of the council, or, as the enemies of the council desired would they persist in their opposition? As a matter of fact, not a single one of them was disloyal to his sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. As long as the discussions lasted they expressed their views freely and without molestation, and sought to carry them into effect. After the decision, without exception, they came over to it, The two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who on 18 July had voted <em>non placet</em> advanced to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne at the same session and acknowledged their acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> thus defined. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a> said simply and with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> greatness, "Holy Father, now I believe." It is not possible in this brief space to mention the accession of each member of the minority. As concerns the members from North America who are of special interest here, Bishop V&eacute;rot of St. Augustine gave his adhesion to the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> while still at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in a letter addressed on 25 July to the secretary of the council. Bishop Mrac of <a href="../cathen/13487a.htm">Sault-Saint-Marie</a> sent his declaration of adherence at the latest by Jan., 1872. A year later Bishop Domenec of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a> did the same. In 1875 Bishop MacQuaid of Rochester, if not earlier, announced his adherence to the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> by its formal and public <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>. When <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of St. Louis returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on 30 Dec., 1870, he made an address at the reception given him, in which he first gave the reasons that had decided his position at the council as long, as the question was open to discussion, and then closed with the declaration that, now the council had decided, he submitted unconditionally to its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. He expressed himself similarly in a letter of 13 Jan., 1871, to the prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. When Lord Acton questioned the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in regard to his submission, the latter replied by a long letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 29 March, 1871, which shows, it may be, a certain discontent, but which clearly confirmed his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a>. In the same way the distinguished <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> and Englishmen who, outside of the council, had expressed opinions antagonistic to the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Gratry</a>, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, and finally, as it appears, Acton, also submitted after the decision had been made. On the other hand, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> a number of Professor <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger's</a> adherents <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatised</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and formed the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>. <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> also <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>, without, however, connecting himself with any other denomination. In <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> the opponents of the council united in a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> called Christian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Outside of these, however the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the entire world, both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, accepted the decision of the council with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and readiness. After the close of the Franco-German War the German Government made the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a> the excuse for what is called the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were ready to bear loss of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and exile rather than be disloyal to any part of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government took the opportunity offered by the definition to relieve itself from uncomfortable <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, and declared that, as the other contracting party had changed, the Concordat with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> was annulled. Excepting in a few <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> cantons, the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the decision of the council did not encounter any actual difficulties elsewhere.
<h2 id="section4">The results</h2>

<p>In comparison with the large scope of the preparations for the council, and with the great amount of material laid before it for discussion in the numerous drafts and proposals, the immediate result of its labours must be called small. But the council was only in its beginnings when the outbreak of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> brought it to a sudden close. It is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as is known, that reasons within the council prevented a larger result from its sessions. Thus it was that in the end only two not very large Constitutions could be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. If, however, the contents of these two constitutions be examined their great importance is unmistakable. The contents meet in a striking manner the needs of the times.

<p>A. The dogmatic Constitution on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> defends the fundamental principles of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of modern <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>. In the first chapter it maintains the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of a personal God</a>, Who of His own free volition for the revelation of His perfection, has created all things out of nothing, Who foresees all things, even the future free actions of reasonable creatures, and Who through His Providence leads all things to the intended end. The second chapter treats the natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It then declares that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the beginning and end of all things can also be known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> by the natural light of reason. It then treats the actuality and necessity of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, of the two sources of Revelation, Scripture and tradition, of the inspiration and interpretation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The third chapter treats the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> virtue of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, its reasonableness supernaturalness, and necessity, the possibility and actuality of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as a confirmation of Divine Revelation; and lastly, the founding of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as the Guardian and Herald of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The fourth chapter contains the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, especially important today, on the connection between <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and reason. The mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot, indeed, be fully grasped by natural reason, but <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can never contradict the positive results of the investigation of reason. Contrariwise, however, every assertion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that contradicts the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of enlightened <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Faith and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> learning are not in hostile opposition; they rather support each other in many ways. Yet <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the same as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system of teaching that has been worked out and then turned over to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to be further developed, but it has been entrusted as a Divine deposit to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for protection and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallible</a> interpretation. When, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> explains the meaning of a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> this interpretation is to be maintained in all future time, and it can never be deviated from under pretence of a more profound investigation. At the close of the Constitution the opposing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are rejected in eighteen canons.

<p>B. The other dogmatic Constitution is of equal, if not greater, importance; it is the first on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or, as it is also called in reference to its contents, on the Pope of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. "The introduction to the Constitution says that the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, on which the unity, strength, and stability of the entire Church rests, has always been, and is especially now, the object of violent attacks by the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of its origin, constant permanence, and nature must be clearly set forth and established, above all on account of the opposing <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Thus the first chapter treats of the establishment of the Apostolic primacy in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Each chapter closes with a canon against the opposing dogmatic opinion. The most important matter of the Constitution is the last two chapters. In the third chapter the meaning and nature of the primacy are set forth in clear words. The primacy of the Pope of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is no mere precedence of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. On the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> possesses the primacy of regularly constituted power over all other Churches, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, direct, episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>, in respect to which the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and faithful of every rite and rank are bound to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> obedience. The immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> of the individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, therefore, is not impaired by the primacy, but only strengthened and defended. By virtue of his primacy the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to have direct and free relations with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the entire Church. No one is permitted to interfere with this intercourse. It is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and to be rejected to say that the decrees issued by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are not valid unless confirmed by the <em>placet</em> of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is also the supreme judge of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, to whose decision all matters under examination by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can be appealed. On the other hand, no further appeal, not even to an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>, can be made from the supreme decision of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Consequently the canon appended to the third chapter says: "When, therefore, anyone says that the Pope of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has only the office of supervision or of guidance, and not the complete and highest <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> over the entire <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not merely in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, but also in matters which concern the discipline and administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the entire world, or that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has only the chief share, but not the entire fullness of this highest power, or that this his power is not actual and immediate either over all and individual Churches, or over all and individual <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and faithful, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."

<p>The fourth chapter, lastly, contains the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. First, all the corresponding decrees of the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Fourth Council of Constantinople</a>, 680 (Sixth Ecumenical), of the <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a>, 1274 (Fourteenth Ecumenical) and of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, 1439 (Seventeenth Ecumenical), are repeated and confirmed. It is pointed out, further, that at all times the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, in the consciousness of their <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a> in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for the preservation of the purity of the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a>, have acted as the court of last instance and have been called upon as such. Then follows the important tenet that the successors of St. Peter have been promised the Holy Ghost, not for the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of new doctrines, but only for the preservation and interpretation of the Revelation delivered by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The Constitution closes with the following words: "Faithfully adhering, therefore, to the tradition inherited from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, we, with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the sacred council, for the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> our Saviour, for the exaltation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples, teach and define, as a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divinely revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when he, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, by virtue of his supreme Apostolic authority, decides that a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> is to be held by the entire <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he possesses, in consequence of the Divine aid promised him in St. Peter, that <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> with which the Divine Saviour wished to have His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> furnished for the definition of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>; and that such definitions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> are of themselves, and not in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> consent, irreformable."

<p>What is given above is essentially the contents of the two Constitutions of the Vatican Council. Their import may be briefly expressed thus: in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> and <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">Free-thinking</a> of the present day the first Constitution gives authoritative and clear expression of the fundamental principles of natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> understanding of right and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, their possibility, necessity, their sources, and of their relations to each other. Thus it offers to all of honest intention a guide and a firm foothold, both in solving the great question of life and in all the investigations of learning. The second Constitution settles finally a question which had kept the minds of men disturbed from the time of the Great Schism, and the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and more especially from the appearance of the four Gallican articles of 1682, the question of the relation between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. According to the dogmatic decision of the Vatican Council, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the crown and centre of the entire constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> includes in itself the entire fullness of the power of administration and teaching bestowed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> upon His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> particularism and the theory of national Churches are forever overthrown. On the other hand, it is extravagant and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to say that by the definition of the primacy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a> the ecumenical councils have lost their essential importance. The ecumenical councils have never been absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Even before the Vatican Council their decrees obtained general currency only through the approval of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The increasing difficulty of their convocation as time went on is shown by the interval of three hundred years between the nineteenth and twentieth ecumenical councils. The definitions of the last council have, therefore, brought about the alleviation that was desirable and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> legal <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Apart from this, however, the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> united with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> is, now as formerly, the most complete representation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Lastly, as regards the drafts and proposition which were left unsettled by the Vatican Council, a number of these were revived and brought to completion by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and his two successors. To mention a few: <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> made St. Joseph the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the Universal Church on 8 Dec., 1870, the same year as the council. Moral and religious problems, which it was intended to lay before the council for discussion, are treated in the encyclicals of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on the origin of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> (1881), on <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> (1884), on human freedom (1888), on Christian marriage (1880), etc. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> also issued in 1900 new regulations regarding the index of forbidden books. From the beginning of his administration <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> seems to have had in view in his legislative labours the completion of the great tasks left by the Vatican Council. The most striking <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of this are: the reform of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, the regulation of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies of candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the introduction of one <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for the Roman church province, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning the form of ritual for <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> and marriage, the revision of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and, above all, the codification of the whole of modern canon law.
