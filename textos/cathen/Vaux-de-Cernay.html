<h1>Vaux-de-Cernay</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> situated in the <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Diocese of Versailles</a>, Seine-et-Oise, in what was called the "Isle-de-France". In 1118 Simon de Neauffle and his wife Eve donated the land for this foundation to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Savigny, in order to have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built there in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John Baptist</a>. Blessed Vital, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Savigny, accepted their offer, and sent a band of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> under the direction of Arnaud, who became their first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Besides their first benefactors, numerous others of the nobility came to the aid of the new community. As soon as they were well established, many <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> presented themselves for admission, rendering possible the foundation of Breuil-Benoit (1137) in the Diocese of Evreu. In 1148 vaux-de-Cernay, with the entire Congregation of Savigny, entered the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> and became a filiation of Clairvaux. Up to this period their substance was only enough for them to live on, but from this time they became prosperous, built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in the simple <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> style, and little by little, constructed the other regular places. Many of its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> became well known. Andrew, the fourth, died <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>; Guy, the sixth, was the most celebrated, having been delegated by the General Chapter to accompany the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section5">Fifth Crusade</a> in 1203. Three years later he was one of the principal figures in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, in recognition of which service he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carcasone (1211) and is commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menology</a>. His nephew Peter, also a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Vaux-de-Cernay, accompanied him on this <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and left a history of both the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. It was under his successor, Abbot Thoas, that Porrois, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (later on the famous Abbey of Port-Royal), was founded and placed under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Vaux-de-Cernay. The ninth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Thibault de Marley (1235-47), was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> and worked many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> both before and after death. Towards the end of the fourteenth century the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> began losing its fervour, both on account of too great wealth and because of the disturbed state of the times. But after the introduction of commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> (1542) there was little left besides the name of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In the seventeenth century it was restored in spirit by embracing the Reform of the Strict Observance of Denis Largentier. It was during this time that its <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a> was John Casimir, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was suppressed at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a> (1791) and its members (twelve priests) dispersed. The buildings, after passing through various hands, are now partly restored and are much admired both by artists and archaeologists.
