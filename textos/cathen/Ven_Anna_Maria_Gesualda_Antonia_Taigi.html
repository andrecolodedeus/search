<h1>Ven. Anna Maria Gesualda Antonia Taigi</h1>  

<p>(<em>Maiden name</em> Giannetti.)

<p>Venerable Servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 29 May, 1769; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 9 June, 1837. Her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Luigi Giannetti and Maria Masi, kept an apothecary shop at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, but lost all their fortune and were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in search of a livelihood. Anna Maria was then five years old. Having been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in all the domestic virtues, she was married in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, 7 January, 1789, to Dominico Taigi, a retainer of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Chigi, with whom she lived happily for forty-eight years. Hitherto nothing extraordinary had happened in her life. But one day while she <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> with her husband at the <em>Confessio</em> in St. Peter's she felt a strong inspiration to renounce such little vanities of the world as she had allowed herself. She began to pay little attention to dress and to listen to the inner voice of grace. Soon afterwards she was received publicly in the Third <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Order of Trinitarians</a> in the Church of S. Carlo alle Quarto Fontane, and having found holy spiritual directors, she made rapid progress in the way of perfection. All the money she could spare she devoted to the poor and miserable, and though not rich she was very charitable. Of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> she regularly visited, the preferred one was S. Giacomo of the Incurables. Despite her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, she never neglected her own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Of her children two died young, the others grew up in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> under the surveillance of the mother. But she never availed herself of her connections with <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of good position to take her children out of their <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> social environment. The whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were wont to assemble for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in a small private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and here, later on, in a small private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and here, later on, <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who dwelt with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The great virtues of Anna Maria were rewarded by extraordinary <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts of God's grace</a>. During many years, when <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in her <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> she had <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> and frequent <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a>, in which she foresaw the future. She exercised a peculiar influence over <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and converted many a sinner to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. During her life she suffered much both corporally and spiritually, and was at times meanly <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a>. But after death her name soon became <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Her body was several times transferred, and rests finally at S. Crisogono in Trastevere. The process of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was begun in 1863, but has not yet been finished.
