<h1>Ven. Anne Catherine Emmerich</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmatic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic</a>, born 8 September, 1774, at Flamsche, near Coesfeld, in the <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia, Germany</a>; died at Dulmen, 9 February, 1824.

<p>Her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, both peasants, were very <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and pious. At twelve she was bound out to a farmer, and later was a seamstress for several years. Very delicate all the time, she was sent to study <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">music</a>, but finding the organist's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> very <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> she gave them the little she had saved to enter a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and actually waited on them as a servant for several years. Moreover, she was at times so pressed for something to eat that her mother brought her bread at intervals, parts of which went to her master's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. In her twenty-eighth year (1802) she entered the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Agnetenberg, Dulmen. Here she was content to be regarded as the lowest in the house. Her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, however, disturbed the tepid <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, who were puzzled and annoyed at her <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">strange powers</a> and her weak health, and notwithstanding her <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> in <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, cell, or at work, treated her with some antipathy. Despite her excessive frailty, she discharged her <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> cheerfully and faithfully. When Jerome Bonaparte closed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in 1812 she was compelled to find refuge in a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> house. In 1813 she became bedridden. She foresaw the downfall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> twelve years in advance, and counseled in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> way the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>. Even in her childhood the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> was so ordinary to her that in her innocent <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> she thought all other children enjoyed the same favours that she did, i.e. to converse familiarly with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Child Jesus</a>, etc. She displayed a marvellous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> when the sick and <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> came to the "bright little sister" seeking aid; she knew their diseases and prescribed remedies that did not fail. By nature she was quick and lively and easily moved to great sympathy by the sight of the sufferings of others. This feeling passed into her spiritual being with the result that she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and suffered much for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> whom she often saw, and for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of sinners whose miseries were known to her even when far away. Soon after she was confined to bed (1813) the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a> came externally, even to the marks of the <a href="../cathen/04540b.htm">thorns</a>. All this she unsuccessfully tried to conceal as she had concealed the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">crosses</a> impressed upon her breast.

<p>Then followed what she dreaded on account of its publicity, an <a href="../cathen/04164c.htm">episcopal commission</a> to inquire into her life, and the reality of these wonderful <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>. The examination was very strict, as the utmost care was necessary to furnish no pretext for ridicule and insult on the part of the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the famous <a href="../cathen/11362b.htm">Overberg</a>, and three physicians conducted the investigation with scrupulous care and became convinced of the <a href="../cathen/13428b.htm">sanctity</a> of the "pious <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguine</a>", as she was called, and the genuineness of the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>. At the end of 1818 <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> granted her earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be relieved of the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>, and the wounds in her hands and feet closed, but the others remained, and on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> were all wont to reopen. In 1819 the government sent a committee of investigation which discharged its commission most brutally. Sick unto death as she was, she was forcibly removed to a large room in another house and kept under the strictest surveillance day and night for three weeks, away from all her friends except her confessor. She was insulted, threatened, and even flattered, but in vain. The commission departed without finding anything suspicious, and remained silent until its president, taunted about his reticence, declared that there was fraud, to which the obvious reply was: In what respect? and why delay in publishing it? About this time <a href="../cathen/02759a.htm">Klemens Brentano</a>, the famous poet, was induced to visit her; to his great amazement she recognized him, and told him he had been pointed out to her as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was to enable her to fulfil <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> command, namely, to write down for the good of innumerable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> made to her. He took down briefly in writing the main points, and, as she spoke the <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> dialect, he immediately rewrote them in ordinary <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a>. He would read what he wrote to her, and change and efface until she gave her complete approval. Like so many others, he was won by her evident purity, her exceeding <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and patience under sufferings indescribable. With <a href="../cathen/11362b.htm">Overberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/13328a.htm">Sailer of Ratisbon</a>, Clement Augustus of Cologne, <a href="../cathen/14299b.htm">Stollberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/07240b.htm">Louisa Hensel</a>, etc., he reverenced her as a chosen <a href="../cathen/09703a.htm">bride of Christ</a>.

<p>In 1833 appeared the first-fruits of <a href="../cathen/02759a.htm">Brentano's</a> toil, "The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the Meditations of Anne Catherine Emmerich" (Sulzbach). <a href="../cathen/02759a.htm">Brentano</a> prepared for publication "The Life of The Blessed Virgin Mary", but this appeared at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> only in 1852. From the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="../cathen/02759a.htm">Brentano</a> Father Schmoeger published in three volumes "The Life of Our Lord" (Ratisbon, 1858-80), and in 1881 a large illustrated edition of the same. The latter also wrote her life in two volumes (Freiburg, 867-70, new edition, 1884). Her <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> go into details, often slight, which give them a vividness that strongly holds the reader's interest as one graphic scene follows another in rapid succession as if visible to the physical eye. Other <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystics</a> are more concerned with <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, she with events; others stop to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditate</a> aloud and to guide the reader's thoughts, she lets the facts speak for themselves with the simplicity, brevity, and security of a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative. Her treatment of that difficult subject, the twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is admirable. His humanity stands out clear and distinct, but through it shines always a gleam of the Divine. The rapid and silent spread of her works through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and elsewhere speaks well for their merit. Strangely enough they produced no controversy. <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> extolls their merits in the highest terms (Le Monde, 15 April, 1860).

<p>Sister Emmerich lived during one of the saddest and least glorious periods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> history, when <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a> triumphed, impiety flourished, and several of the fairest provinces of its domain were overrun by <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a> and cast into such ruinous condition that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> seemed about to be completely extinguished. Her mission in part seems to have been by her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and sufferings to aid in restoring <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">Church discipline</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and at the same time to strengthen at least the little ones of the flock in their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Besides all this she <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a> many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and recalled to the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> is around about it to a degree sometimes forgotten. A rumour that the body was <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> caused her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a> to be opened six weeks after her death. The body was found fresh, without any sign of corruption. In 1892 the process of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was introduced by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>.
