<h1>Ven. Antonio Mar&iacute;a Claret y Clar&aacute;</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and missionary, born at Sallent, near <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, 23 Dec., 1807; d. at Fontfroide, Narbonne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, on 24 Oct., 1870. Son of a small woollen manufacturer, he received an elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his native village, and at the age of twelve became a weaver. A little later he went to Barcelona to specialize in his trade, and remained there till he was twenty. Meanwhile he devoted his spare time to study and became proficient in Latin, French, and engraving; in addition he enlisted in the army as a volunteer. Recognizing a call to a higher life, he left Barcelona, entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a> in 1829, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 13 June, 1835. He received a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in his native <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, where he continued to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> till 1839. He now wished to become a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>; missionary work, however, appealing strongly to him he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> but finding himself unsuited for that manner of life, he returned shortly to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and exercised his ministry at Valadrau and Gerona, attracting notice by his efforts on behalf of the poor. Recalled by his superiors to <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a>, he was engaged in missionary work throughout Catalonia. In 1848 he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a> where he gave retreats for fifteen months. Returning to Vich he established the Congregation of the Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (16 July, 1849), and founded the great religious <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at Barcelona which bears his name, and which has issued several million cheap copies of the best ancient and modern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> works.

<p>Such had been the fruit of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> labours and so great the wonders he had worked, that <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> at the request of the Spanish sovereign appointed him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santiago de Cuba in 1851. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a> and embarked at Barcelona on 28 Dec. Having arrived at his destination he began at once a work of thorough reform. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was reorganized, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> discipline strengthened, and over nine thousand marriages validated within the first two years. He erected a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and numerous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Three times he made a visitation of the entire diocese, giving local missions incessantly. Naturally his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> stirred up the enmity and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of the irreligious, as had happened previously in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. No less than fifteen attempts were made on his life, and at Holguin his cheek was laid open from ear to chin by a would-be assassin's knife. In February, 1857, he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by Isabella II, who made him her confessor. He obtained permission to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of <a href="../cathen/15016a.htm">Trajanopolis</a>. His influence was now directed solely to help the poor and to propagate learning; he lived frugally and took up his residence in an Italian hospice. For nine years he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> where he established an excellent scientific laboratory, a museum of natural history, a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, college, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of music and languages. His further plans were frustrated by the revolution of 1868. He continued his popular missions and distribution of good books wherever he went in accompanying the Spanish Court. When Isabella recognized the new Government of United <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he left the Court and hastened to take his place by the side of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; at the latter's command, however, he returned to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> with faculties for absolving the queen from the censures she had incurred. In 1869 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to prepare for the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Owing to failing health he withdrew to Prades in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he was still harassed by his <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> Spanish enemies; shortly afterwards he retired to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Fontfroide where he expired.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> life and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonders</a> he wrought both before and after his death testified to his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Informations were begun in 1887 and he was declared Venerable by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1899. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transferred to the mission house at <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a> in 1897, at which time his heart was found incorrupt, and his grave is constantly visited by many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. In addition to the Congregation of the Missionary Sons of the Heart of Mary (approved definitively by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 11 Feb., 1870) which has now over 110 houses and 2000 members, with missions in W. Africa, and in Choc&oacute; (Columbia), Archbishop Claret founded or drew up the rules of several communities of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. By his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and writings he contributed greatly to bring about the revival of the Catalan language. His printed works number over 130, of which we may mention: "La escalade Jacob"; "Maximas de moral la m&aacute;s pura"; "Avisos"; "Catecismo explicado con l&aacute;minas"; "La llave de oro"; "Selectos paneg&iacute;ricos" (11 vols.); "Sermones de misi&oacute;n" (3 vols.); "Misi&oacute;n de la mujer"; "Vida de Sta. M&oacute;nica"; "La Virgen del Pilar y los Francmasones"; and his "Autobiografia", written by order of his <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, but still unpublished.
