<h1>Ven. Bartholomew of Braga</h1>  

<p>Born at Verdela, near <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, May, 1514; died at Viana, 16 July, 1590. Bartholomew Fernandez, later known as a Martyribus, out of veneration for the church in which he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, came of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> parentage. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, 11 November, 1527, and was professed 20 November, 1529. On the completion of his studies, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, and then for about twenty years <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in various houses of his order. In 1551 he received the Master's degree at the provincial chapter of Salamanca. While teaching <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Batalha, he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a> by the Infante Dom Luis to undertake the religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his son, Dom Antonio, who was entering the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. He devoted two years to this task. In 1558, against his own desires, and only out of obedience to his provincial, <a href="../cathen/09385b.htm">Luis of Granada</a>, he accepted the appointment to the <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">archiepiscopal See of Braga</a>, for which he had been chosen by Queen Catherine, and in 1559 received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. With <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> he devoted himself to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his new office.

<p>On the resumption of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">General Council of Trent</a> in 1561, Bartholomew repaired to the council and took part in the last sessions. He was highly esteemed among the Fathers of the council both on account of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of his life, and he exercised great influence in the discussions, particularly those with regard to the decrees on the reform of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. On the conclusion of the council he returned, in February, 1564, to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and in 1566 held an important provincial synod in which excellent decrees were passed for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and the elevation of the moral life of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people (Concilium provinciale Bracarense quartum, Braga, 1567). The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> now devoted himself most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to the task of carrying out the reforms of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> as well as the decrees of his own provincial synod. A great famine and a visitation of the plague revealed the depths of his charity. After repeated requests, having received, on 20 February, 1582, permission to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he withdrew to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of his order at Viana, to prepare in solitude for the end.

<p>In 1845 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> declared him Venerable. In the interests of a truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and the promotion of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, he wrote: "Compendium spiritualis doctrinae ex variis sanc. Patrum sententiis magana ex parte collectum" (Lisbon, 1582); "Stimulus pastorum ex gravissimis sanct. Patrum sententiis concinnatus, in quo agitur de vita et moribus episcoporum aliorumque praelatorum" (Rome, 1564; published at the instance of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>); "Catechismo ou Doutrina christiana" (Lisbon, 1562). All these writings have been frequently republished and translated into several languages. A collective edition is: "Opera omnia cura et studio Malachiae d'Inguinbert, archiep. Theodos." (1 vol. Fol. In 2 parts, Rome, 1734-35).
