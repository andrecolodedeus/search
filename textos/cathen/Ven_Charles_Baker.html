<h1>Ven. Charles Baker</h1>  

<p>(<em>Rect&eacute;</em>, according to his own entry in the English College David Henry Lewis).

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born in Monmouthshire in 1616; died at Usk, 27 August, 1679. His father, Morgan Lewis, was a lax <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, afterwards converted; his mother, Margaret Pritchard, was a very devout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. David was brought up as a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Royal Grammar School at Abergavenny, of which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was the head master. In his sixteenth year, he spent three months in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> as companion to the son of Earl Rivers, and there was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by a Father Talbot, S.J. On returning to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he remained with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> till their death and then, having a desire for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was admitted as an <em>alumnus</em> to the English College, 3 November, 1638. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1642, and entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the Society at Sant' Andrea, 16 April, 1644. In 1647 he was sent to the English mission, but was quickly recalled and made Spiritual Father at the Roman College. In 1648 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> finally, and was assigned to the South <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> District, where he labored <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for twenty-eight years. It is told of him that to avoid the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>, he used to take long and dangerous journeys at night that he might be able to visit the faithful under cover of darkness, and that his devotedness gained for him the title Father of the Poor.

<p>In the summer of 1678, Titus Oates came forward with his pretended revelations, and Parliament in a frenzy of bigotry offered fresh rewards for the discovery and arrest of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Father David was one of the victims. A bigoted <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> magistrate named Arnold, who had hitherto professed friendship for him, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be arrested at Llantarnam in Monmouthshire, 17 November, 1678. He was carried in a sort of triumphal procession to Abergavenny, where, in allusion to one article of Oates' fabrications, he was shown to the people as "the pretended <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>". He was then committed for trial, and meanwhile <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, first at Monmouth and then at Usk. The trial came off at Monmouth, 16 March, 1679. It was impossible to connect Father David with the pretended Popish Plot, so he was charged under the Statute of 27 Elizabeth, which made it high treason to take orders abroad in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and afterwards to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. The trial was not too fairly conducted, and the witnesses were of a worthless class. Still the breach of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was undeniable, and he was condemned to undergo the barbarous penalties which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> prescribed. For the moment, indeed, he was reprieved, and taken up to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, to be confronted with Oates and his associates. It was hoped that he might be induced to save his life either by apostasy or by inculpating some others in the Plot. But this hope <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> vain, he was sent back to Monmouthshire, and his sentence was carried out at Usk. The cause of his beatification was introduced, under the name of "David Lewis, <em>alias</em> Charles Baker" by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 4 December, 1886.
