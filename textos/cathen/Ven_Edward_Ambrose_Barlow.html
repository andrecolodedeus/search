<h1>Ven. Edward Ambrose Barlow</h1>  

<p>(<em>Alias</em> R<font size=-2>ADCLIFFE</font> and B<font size=-2>RERETON</font>.)

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. at Barlow Hall, 1585; d. 10 September, 1641. He was the fourth son of Sir Alexander Barlow, Knight of Barlow Hall, near <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, by Mary, daughter of Sir Uryan Brereton, Knight of Handforth Hall, Co. Chester, and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Didsbury Church 30 November, 1585; the entry in the register may still be seen. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Gregory, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, he entered the English College, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, 20 September, 1610, but returned to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> where his elder brother <a href="../cathen/02298c.htm">William Rudesind</a> was a professed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. He was himself professed in 1616 and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 1617. Sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he laboured in South Lancashire with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> and fervour. He resided chiefly at Wardley Hall, the seat of the Downe <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, near <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, and at Morley's Hall, a mansion of the Tyldesleys, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Leigh, some seven miles from <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>. At the former, his skull is still preserved, in a little receptacle on the staircase. At the latter he was apprehended for the fifth and last time on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, 25 April, 1641. He was arrested by the Vicar of Eccles, who marched at the head of his parishoners, clad in his <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, and was followed by some 400 men armed with clubs and swords. He was preaching at the time and could have escaped in the confusion, but yielded himself up to his enemies, and was carried off to Lancaster Castle. Here after four months' <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> he was tried, on 6 or 7 September, and sentenced next day, having confessed that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. On Friday, 10 September, he suffered the usual penalties at Lancaster.

<p>A beautiful picture of his life is given by Challoner from two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> relations belonging to St. Gregory's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, one written by his brother <a href="../cathen/02298c.htm">Dom Rudesind Barlow</a>, President of the Anglo-Benedictine Congregation. There is another <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, entitled "The Apostolical Life of Ambrose Barlow", written by one of his pupils for <a href="../cathen/02298c.htm">Dom Rudesind</a>, which is at present in the Library of Owen's College, Manchester. It is to be printed among the publications of the Chetham Society. This contains many details hitherto unpublished. Two portraits of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> exist and also one of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Sir Alexander. Many of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are also preserved, a hand being at <a href="../cathen/14244a.htm">Stanbrook Abbey</a> near <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. A full biography is in course of preparation.
