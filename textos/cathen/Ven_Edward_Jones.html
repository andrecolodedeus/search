<h1>Ven. Edward Jones</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. in the <a href="../cathen/13332c.htm">Diocese of St. Asaph</a>, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; d. in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 6 May 1590. Bred an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the English College, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 1587; he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1588, and went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the same year. In 1590 he was arrested by a priest-catcher, who pretended to be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, in a shop in Fleet Street. He was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Tower and brutally tortured by Topcliffe, finally admitting he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and had been an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>. These admissions were used against him at his trial, but he made a skillful and learned defense, pleading that a confession elicited under torture was not legally sufficient to ensure a conviction. The court complimented him on his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> bearing, but of course he was convicted of <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">high treason</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> coming into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. On the same day he was hanged, drawn, and quartered, opposite the grocer's shop where he had been captured, in Fleet Street near the Conduit. On the same day there suffered Anthony Middleton, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born probably at Middleton-Tyas, Yorkshire, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown, son of Ambrose Middleton of Barnard Castle, <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, and Cecil, daughter of Anthony Crackenthorpe of Howgill Castle, Westmoreland. He entered the English College at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> 9 Jan., 1582; was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 30 May 1586, and went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the same year. His work lay in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and the neighbourhood and he laboured very successfully; he was captured at a house in Clerkenwell (London) by the same artifice which was practiced on Father Jones. On the ladder he said: "I call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness I die merely for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and for being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Religion"; and someone present called out, "Sir, you have spoken very well". The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was cut down and disemboweled while yet alive.
