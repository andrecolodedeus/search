<h1>Ven. George Napper</h1>  

<p>(Or Napier).

<p><a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a> manor, Oxford, 1550; executed at Oxford 9 November, 1610. He was a son of Edward Napper (d. in 1558), sometime Fellow of All Souls College, by Anne, his second wife, daughter of John Peto, of Chesterton, Warwickshire, and niece of <a href="../cathen/11785a.htm">William, Cardinal Peto</a>. He entered Corpus Christi College 5 January, 1565-6, but was ejected in 1568 as a <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a>. On 24 August, 1579, he paid a visit to the English College at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and by December, 1580, he had been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. He was still in the Wood Street Counter, London, on 30 September, 1588; but was liberated in June, 1589, on acknowledging the royal supremacy. He entered the English College, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, in 1596, and was sent on the mission in 1603. He appears to have lived with his brother William at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a>. He was arrested at Kirtlington, four miles from Woodstock, very early in the morning of 19 July, 1610, when he on him a <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> containing two <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Hosts as well as a small <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a>. Brought before Sir Francis Eure at Upper Heyford (Wood says before a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> named Chamberlain), he was strictly searched; but the constable found nothing but his breviary, his <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a>, and a needle case with thread and thimble. The next day he was sent to Oxford Castle, and indicted at the session soon after under 27 Eliz., c. 2 for being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The possession of the oils was held to be conclusive and he was condemned, but reprieved. In gaol he reconciled a condemned felon named Falkner, and this was held to aggravate his crime, but as late as 2 November it was believed that he would have his sentence commuted to one of banishment. As he refused the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of allegiance</a>, which described the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> deposing power as a "false, damnable, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>" <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, it was decided to execute him. He suffered between one and two in the afternoon, having said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> that morning. His head according to Wood was set up on Tom Gateway; according to Challoner's less probable statement on Christ Church steeple. His quarters were placed on the four city gates, but at least some were secretly removed, and buried in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> (now a barn) of Sanford manor, formerly a preceptory of <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar.</a>
