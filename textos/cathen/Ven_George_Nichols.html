<h1>Ven. George Nichols</h1>  

<p>(Or NICOLLS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, born at Oxford about 1550; executed at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, 19 October, 1589. He entered Brasenose College in 1564 or 1565, and was readmitted 20 August, 1567, and supplicated for his <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A. degree</a> in 1570-1. He subsequently became an usher at St. Paul's School, London. He arrived at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> with <a href="../cathen/12084a.htm">Thomas Pilchard</a>, 20 Nov., 1581; but went on to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whence he returned 21 July, 1582. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at Laon (probably by Bishop Valentine Douglas, O.S.B.) in April, 1583, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> by Cardinal Archbishop Louis de <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a>) 24 Sept., he was sent on the mission the same year. Having converted many, notably a convicted highwayman in Oxford Castle, he was arrested at the Catherine Wheel Inn, opposite the east end of St. Mary Magdalen's Church, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, together with Humphrey Prichard, a <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> servant at the inn, <a href="../cathen/02425b.htm">Thomas Belson</a>, and Richard Yaxley. This last was a son (probably the third, certainly not the sixth) of William Yaxley of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, Lincolnshire, by Rose, daughter of John Langton of Northolme. Arriving at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> 29 August, 1582, he received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> 23 Sept., 1583, and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> 5 or 6 April, 1585, from the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Probably the same hand conferred the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> on 20 April. The <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was conferred at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> by Louis de Breze, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, 21 Sept., 1585. Yaxley left <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> 28 January, 1585-86. All four <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were sent from Oxford to the Bridewell <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where the two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were hanged up for five hours to make them betray their hosts, but without avail. Yaxley was sent to the Tower as a close <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> 25 May, 1589, and appears to have been racked frequently. Belson was sent to the Gatehouse. The other two remained in Bridewell, Nichols being put into a deep dungeon full of venomous vermin. On 30 June all four were ordered back to Oxford to take their trial. All were condemned, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for treason, the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> for felony. Nichols suffered first, then Yaxley, then Belson, and last Prichard. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests'</a> heads were set up on the castle, and their quarters on the four city gates.
