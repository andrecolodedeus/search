<h1>Ven. Giuseppe Maria Pignatelli</h1>  

<p>Born 27 December, 1737, in <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; died 11 November, 1811. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> descent and noble lineage. After finishing his early studies in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of Saragossa, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> (8 May, 1753) notwithstanding his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family's</a> opposition. On concluding his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and taught at Saragossa. In 1766 the Governor of Saragossa was held responsible for the threatened famine, and so enraged was the populace against him that they were about to destroy his palace by fire. Pignatelli's persuasive power over the people averted the calamity. Despite the letter of thanks sent by Charles III the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were accused of instigating the above-mentioned riot. Pignatelli's refutation of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> was followed by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of expulsion of the Fathers of Saragossa (4 April, 1767). Minister Aranda offered to reinstate Nicola and Giuseppe Pignatelli, providing they abandon their order, but in spite of Giuseppe's ill-health they stood firm. Not permitted by <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a> to land at Civita Vecchia, with the other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, he repaired to St. Boniface in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a> where he displayed singular ability for organization in providing for five hundred fathers and students. His sister, the Duchess of Acerra, aided him with money and provisions. He organized studies and maintained regular observance. When <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> assumed control of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. He was again detailed to secure a location in the legation of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, not only for the fathers of his own province of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, but also for those of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> and Mexico, but the community was dissolved in August, 1773. The two Pignatelli brothers were then <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to betake themselves to Bologna, where they lived in retirement (being forbidden to exercise the sacred ministry). They devoted themselves to study and Pignatelli himself collected books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> bearing on the history of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. On ascertaining from <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> still survived in White Russia, he desired to be received there. For various reasons he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to defer his departure. During this delay he was invited, on the instance of Ferdinand, Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, to re-establish the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in his States; and in 1793, having obtained through Catharine II a few fathers from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, with other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, an establishment was made. On 6 July, 1797, Pignatelli there renewed his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. In 1799 he was appointed master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in Colerno. On the decease of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, the States of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> were placed under allegiance of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Notwithstanding this fact, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> remained undisturbed for eighteen months, during which period Pignatelli was appointed Provincial of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After considerable discussion he obtained the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> (30 July, 1804) was much more favourable than that granted for <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>. The older <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> soon asked to be received back; many, however, engaged in various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> callings, remained at their posts. Schools and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> were opened in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, but when this part of the kingdom fell into <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> power, the dispersion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were ordered; but the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was not rigorously executed. Pignatelli founded colleges in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, and the fathers were invited to other cities. During the exile of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and the French occupation the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> continued unmolested, owing largely to the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and the merits of Pignatelli; he even managed to avoid the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> of allegiance to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. He also secured the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> (1807). Under <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> the cause of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was introduced.
