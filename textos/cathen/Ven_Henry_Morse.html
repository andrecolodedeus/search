<h1>Ven. Henry Morse</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>; b. in 1595 in Norfolk; d. at Tyburn, 1 Feb., 1644. He was received into the church at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, 5 June, 1614, after various journeys was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and left for the mission, 19 June, 1624. He was admitted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Heaton; there he was arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for three years in York Castle, where he made his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> under his fellow <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, Father John Robinson, S.J., and took simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Afterwards he was a missionary to the English regiments in the Low Countries. Returning to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at the end of 1633 he laboured in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and in 1636 is reported to have received about ninety <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He himself contracted the plague but recovered. Arrested 27 February, 1636, he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in Newgate. On 22 April he was brought to the bar charged with being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and having withdrawn the king's subjects from their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and allegiance. He was found guilty on the first count, not guilty on the second, and sentence was deferred. On 23 April he made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">solemn profession</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to Father Edward Lusher. He was released on bail for 10,000 florins, 20 June, 1637, at the insistence of Queen Henriette Maria. In order to free his sureties he <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> went into exile when the royal proclamation was issued ordering all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to leave the country before 7 April, 1641, and became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Gage's English regiment in the service of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1643 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; arrested after about a year and a half he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> and Newcastle, and sent by sea to London. On 30 January he was again brought to the bar and condemned on his previous conviction. On the day of his execution his hurdle was drawn by four horses and the French ambassador attended with all his suite, as also did the <a href="../cathen/05327c.htm">Count of Egmont</a> and the <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> ambassador. The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was allowed to hang until he was dead. At the quartering the footmen of the French Ambassador and of the Count of Egmont dipped their handkerchiefs into the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> blood. In 1647 many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed by evil spirits</a> were relieved through the application of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>.
