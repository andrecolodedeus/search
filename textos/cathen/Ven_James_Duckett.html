<h1>Ven. James Duckett</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, b. at Gilfortrigs in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Skelsmergh in Westmoreland, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> uncertain, of an ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of that county; d. 9 April, 1601. He was a bookseller and publisher in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. His godfather was the well-known <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> James Leybourbe of Skelsmergh. He seems, however, to have been brought up a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, for he was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> while an apprentice in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> by reading a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> book lent him by a friend. Before he could be received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he was twice <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for not attending the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> service, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to compound for his apprenticeship and leave his master. He was finally reconciled by a venerable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Weekes who was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Gatehouse at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a>. After two or three years he married a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, but out of his twelve years of married life, no less than nine were spent in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, owing to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in propagating <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature and his wonderful constancy in his new-found <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. His last apprehension was brought about by Peter Bullock, a bookbinder, who betrayed him in order to obtain his own release from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. His house was searched on 4 March, 1601, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books were found there, and Duckett was at once thrown into Newgate. At his trial, Bullock testified that he had bound various <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books for Duckett, which the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> acknowledged to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The jury found him not guilty, but Judge Popham at once stood up and bade them consider well what they did, for Duckett had had bound for him Bristowe's "motives", a controversial work peculiarly odious to <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> on account of its learning and cogency. The jury thereupon reversed its verdict and brought in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> guilty of felony. At the same time three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Page, <a href="../cathen/14721c.htm">Tichborne</a>, and Watkinson were condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. Bullock did not save himself by his treachery, for he was conveyed in the same cart as Duckett to Tyburn, where both were executed, 19 April, 1601. There is an account, written by his son, the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">Prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> at Nieuport (Flanders) of James Duckett's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. On the way to Tyburn he was given a cup of <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>; he drank, and desired his wife to drink to Peter Bullock, and freely to forgive him. At the gallows, his last thoughts were for his betrayer. He <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him and implored him to die in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>.
