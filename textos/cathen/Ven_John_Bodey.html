<h1>Ven. John Bodey</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, b. at Wells, Somerset: 1549; d. at Andover, Wilts., 2 November, 1583. He studied at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> and New College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, of which he became a Fellow in 1568. In June, 1576, he was deprived, with seven other Fellows, by the Visitor, Horne, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>. Next year he went to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douay College</a> to study <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in February, 1578, and probably married. Arrested in 1580, he was kept in iron shackles in Winchester gaol, and was condemned in April, 1583, together with John Slade, a schoolmaster, for maintaining the old religion and denying the Royal Supremacy. There was apparently a feeling that this sentence was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and illegal, and they were actually tried and condemned again at Andover, 19 August, 1583, on the same indictment. Bodey had a controversy with Humphreys, Dean of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, on the Nicene Council, and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> notes from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> still exist. After his second trial, he wrote from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to Dr. Humphrey Ely, "We consider that iron for this cause borne on earth shall surmount gold and, precious stones in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. That is our mark, that is our desire. In the mean season we are threatened daily, and do look still when the hurdle shall be brought to the door. I beseech you, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sake, that we want not the good <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of you all for our strength, our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and our perseverance unto the end. . . . From our <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of patience the 16th September, 1583."

<p>At his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, Bodey <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the halter, saying, "O blessed chain, the sweetest chain and richest that ever came about any man's neck", and when told he died for treason, exclaimed, "You may make the hearing of a blessed Mass treason, or the saying of an <em>Ave Maria</em> treason . . . but I have committed no treason, although, indeed, I suffer the punishment due to treason". He exhorted the people to obey Queen Elizabeth and died saying, <em>"Jesu, Jesu, esto mihi Jesus"</em>. His mother made a great feast upon the occasion of her son's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> death, to which she invited her neighbours, rejoicing at his death as his marriage by which his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was happily and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> espoused to the Lamb.
