<h1>Ven. John Martin Moye</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, founder of the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, missionary in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, b. at Cutting, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, 27 January, 1730; d. at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, 4 May, 1793. He was the sixth of the thirteen children of John Moye and Catharine Demange. His older brother, a seminarian, taught him the first rudiments of Latin, and he completed his classical studies at the College of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson. He then studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and entered the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> Seminary of St-Simon, <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, in the fall of 1751. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 9 March, 1754, he was appointed vicar in the episcopal city the same month. His great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> attracted attention; many <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ladies placed themselves under his firm and wise direction. This enabled him to find some select <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for the establishment of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for country children whose <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he had much at heart. He began the work in 1763; in 1767 in spite of the ill-will of many and the persecutions of a few, the Congregation of the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> was founded. That same year he was appointed superior of the little <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Di&eacute;. Leaving the care of his sisterhood to two friends, Father Moye now determined to act upon his long delayed desire to become a missionary. In 1769 he joined the S&eacute;minaire des Missions Etrang&egrave;res at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and in 1773 he was at work in Oriental Su-tchuen, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. Nine years of hard labour, frequently interrupted by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, made him realize the necessity of native help. In 1782 he founded the "Christian Virgins", religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> following the rules of the Congregation of Providence at home, devoting themselves to the care of the sick and to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian instruction</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children in their own homes. After a hundred years of success, they are still active in the Chinese mission. Exhausted by labours and sickness, Father Moye returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1784. He resumed the direction of the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> and evangelized Lorraine and Alsace by preaching missions. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution of 1791</a> drove him into exile, and with his Sisters he retired to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. After the capture of the city by the French troops, typhoid fever broke out and, helped by his Sisters, he devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work. He contracted the virulent disease and died, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Christian charity</a>, 1793. The spot where he was buried is now a public square. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> declared John Martin Venerable and authorized the introduction of the cause of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> 14 January, 1891. [<em>Editor's Note:</em> He was later <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by Pope Pius XII on November 21, 1954.]
