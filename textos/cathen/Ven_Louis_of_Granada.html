<h1>Ven. Louis of Granada</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, writer, and preacher; b. of very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> parentage at <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1505; d. at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 31 December, 1588. At the age of nineteen he was received into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Santa Cruz, <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>. With a mentality of the highest quality and the gift of unremitting application he united a profoundly spiritual character which promised a brilliant and fruitful career in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies finished, he was chosen by his superiors to represent his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at the College of St. Gregory at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, an institution of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> reserved for students possessed of more than ordinary ability. Here he acquitted himself with rare distinction, not only in the regular <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> courses, but in the humanities, to which he gave special attention at the request of his superiors. His studies completed, he at once entered upon the career of a preacher, in which he continued with extraordinary success during forty years. The fame of his preaching spread beyond the boundaries of his native land, and at the request of the Cardinal Infante, Dom Henrique of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, son of King Manuel, he was transferred to the latter country, where he became <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in 1557. His extraordinary <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, learning, and wisdom soon attracted the attention of the queen regent, who appointed him her confessor and counsellor. The Bishopric of Viseu and the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> were successively offered to him only to be courteously, but firmly, refused. The honours of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, offered to him by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a>, were also declined.

<p>Among the hundreds of eminent ascetical writers of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Louis of Granada remains unsurpassed in the beauty and purity of his style, the solidity of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and the popularity and influence of his writings. Besides <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical theology</a>, his published works treat of Scripture, <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, ethics, biography, and history. He is best known, however, for his <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writings. The appreciation of their worth extended throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and later to America, and their popularity still remains but little impaired after the passage of four hundred years. Nearly all of these works were translated into the various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages and several into <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>. The best known of his <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writings, and the one that achieved the greatest measure of success, is "The Sinner's Guide" (La Guia de Pecadores). This work was published at <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a> in 1555. It is marked by a smooth, harmonious style of purest Spanish idiom which has merited for it the reputation of a classic, and by an unctuous eloquence that has made it a perennial source of religious inspiration. It has been most favourable compared with <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">&agrave; Kempis's</a> <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a>. Within a comparatively short time after its first appearance it was translated into Italian, Latin, French, German, Polish, and Greek. A new and revised English translation was published at New York in 1889. His "Memorial of the Christian Life" (Memorial de la vida christiana) is almost equally well known. In 1576 he published at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> a Latin work on the principles of <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> oratory (Rhetoricae Ecclesiasticae, sive de ratione concionandi). It enjoyed an extensive vogue, not only in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but in most of the countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; new editions appeared successively at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1578), Cologne (1578, 1582, 1611), <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1585), and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1635). A Spanish translation was published at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1585. To illustrate the principles embodied in this work, a volume of the author's sermons, marked by great purity of style and deep religious feeling, was published seven years after his death. In all, some twenty-seven works are attributed to his pen. A Latin edition of all his writings was published by Andrew Schott and Michael of Isselt at Cologne in 1628-29. A complete edition of his <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works was brought out at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, in 1679, by Dionysius Sanchez Moreno, O.P., and a complete edition of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, in French, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1868.
