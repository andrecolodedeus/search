<h1>Ven. Marie de l'Incarnation</h1>  

<p>(In the world, MARIE GUYARD).

<p>First superior of the <a href="../cathen/15229a.htm">Ursulines of Quebec</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 28 Oct., 1599; died at Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 30 April 1672. Her father was by birth a bourgeois; her mother was connected with the illustrious house of Barbon de la Bourdaisi&egrave;re. From infancy Marie gave evidences of great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and detachment from the world. At the age of seventeen, in obedience to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, she was married to a silk manufacturer of the name of Martin, and devoted herself without reserve to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> wife. The union was a source of trials: the only consolation it brought her was the birth of a son, who afterwards became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> as Dom Claude, wrote his mother's biography and died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Left a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> after two years of married life, she entertained the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of joining the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, but the care which her child required of her delayed the realization of this project, until he had reached the age of twelve, when she followed her vocation unhesitatingly. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Order had recently been introduced into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by Madame de Sainte-Beuve, and Madame Martin took the veil in the house of that order at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. The care of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> was confided to her two years after her entry into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. She always felt intense <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for saving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and at the age of about thirty-four she experienced new impulses of "the apostolic spirit which transported her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> even to the ends of the earth"; and the longing for her own sanctification, and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of so many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> still under the shadows of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> inspired her with the resolution to go and live in America. She communicated this desire to her confessor, who, after much hesitation, approved it. A <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Mme de la Peltrie, provided the means for its execution. This lady, better known as Marie-Madeleine de Chauvigny, by her generosity, and the sacrifice she made in leaving her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and her country, deserved to be called the co-worker of Marie de l'Incarnation in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Sailing from Dieppe 3 April, 1639, with a few sisters who had begged to be allowed to accompany her, Marie de l'Incarnation, after a perilous voyage of three months, arrived at Quebec and was there joyfully welcomed by the settlers (4July). She and her companions at first occupied a little house in the lower town (Basse-Ville). In the spring of 1641 the foundation-stone was laid of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, on the same spot where it now stands. Marie de l'Incarnation was acknowledged as the superior. To be the more useful to the aborigines, she had set herself to learn their languages immediately on her arrival. Her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion and instruction of the young aborigines, and the wisdom with which she ruled her community were alike remarkable. She suffered great tribulations from the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> who were threatening the colony, but in the midst of them she stood firm and was able to comfort the downcast. On 29 December, 1650, a terrible conflagration laid the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in ashes. She suffered much from the rigours of winter, and took shelter first with the Hospitali&egrave;res and then with Mme de la Peltrie. On 29 May of the following year she inaugurated the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The rest of her life she passed teaching and catechizing the young Indians, and died after forty years of labours, thirty-three of them spent in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.

<p>Marie de l'Incarnation has left a few works which breathe unction, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and resignation to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>. "Des Lettres" (Paris, 1677-1681) contains in its second part an account of the events which took place in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> during her time, and constitute one of the sources for the history of the French colony from 1639 to 1671. There are also a "Retraite", with a short exposition of the Canticle of Canticles, and a familiar "Explication" of the mysteries of the Faith &#151; a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> which she compiled for young religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.
