<h1>Ven. Marina de Escobar</h1>  

<p>Mystic and foundress of a modified branch of the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> Order b. at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 8 Feb., 1554; d. there 9 June, 1633. Her father, Iago de Escobar, was professor of civil and canon law and for a time governor of Osuna, a man noted for his learning and his saintly life; her mother was Margaret <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, daughter of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V's</a> physician. She was an apt scholar and even in youth showed powers of reflection beyond her age. Until her forty-fifth year her attention was given mainly to her own perfection, then she devoted herself more to promoting the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of others. At fifty her continual bodily afflictions became so severe that she was confined to her bed for the remainder of her life. Providence provided her with an admirable spiritual guide, in the Venerable Luis de Ponte (1554-1624). The special external work entrusted to her was to establish a branch of the Order of the Holy Saviour or <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittines</a> but with the rules greatly modified to suit the times and the country. With the revelation of the work came the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that she would not live to see its accomplishment. By divine command, as she believed, she wrote her revelations, and when too feeble she dictated them. Luis de Ponte arranged them and left them for publication after her death. In his preface he declares his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in their genuineness because she advanced in virtue and was preserved free from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> against purity, showed no <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and had peace in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, feared deception, desired no extraordinary favours, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> suffering, was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and, lastly, was obedient to her confessor. The writings were published in one large volume and are divided into six books containing his remarks and her own, interspersed between the visions themselves. Book I treats of the extraordinary means by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had led her; II contains revelations about the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>; III about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>; IV about <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">Guardian Angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">B.V. Mary's</a> prerogatives; V gives means to help <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> and to save <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> on earth; and VI reveals her perfection as shown under terrible sufferings. The style of the work is free and flowing and she speaks with simplicity and na&iuml;ve frankness. The visions, always picturesque, and pleasing or alarming according to their subject, are all instructive and at times distinctly curious; but the descriptions are mere outlines, leaving much to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and never going into details. Their variety is great. For some the following would have special interest: Daily communion and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> objection to it; mystic espousals; how the bodies of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> can appear in visions; internal <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>; some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with whom modern hagiographers have dealt harshly, as <a href="../cathen/03728a.htm">St. Christopher</a>. Their brevity of detail may account in part for the oblivion into which they have fallen. Her life, so far as de Ponte had prepared it, was published at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1664; the second part appeared there in 1673. It was translated into Latin by M. Hanel, S.J., and published again at Prague in 1672-1688, and in an enlarged edition at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> 1690. All these editions are now very rare. A German translation in four volumes, appeared in 1861. (See <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">BRIGITTINES</a>.)
