<h1>Ven. Mark Barkworth</h1>  

<p>(<em>Alias</em> LAMBERT.)

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born about 1572 in Lincolnshire; executed at Tyburn 27 February, 1601. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>, and converted to the Faith at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> in 1594, by Father George, a <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. In 1596 Barkworth went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and thence to Valladolid. On his way to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> he is said to have had a vision of St. Benedict, who told him he would die a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit. Admitted to the English College, 16 December, 1596, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1599, and set out for the English Mission together with <a href="../cathen/06388a.htm">Ven. Thomas Garnet</a>. On his way he stayed at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Hyrache in <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, where his ardent wish to join the order was granted by his being made an Oblate with the privilege of making profession at the hour of death. After having escaped great peril at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, he was arrested on reaching <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and thrown into Newgate, where he lay six months, and was then transferred to Bridewell. Here he wrote an appeal to Cecil, signed "George Barkworth". At his examinations he behaved with extraordinary fearlessness and frank gaiety. Having been condemned he was thrown into "Limbo", the horrible underground dungeon at Newgate, where he remained "very cheerful" till his death.

<p>Barkworth suffered at Tyburn with Ven. Roger Filcock, S.J., and <a href="../cathen/09270b.htm">Ven. Anne Lyne</a>. It was the first Tuesday in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, a bitterly cold day. He sang, on the way to Tyburn, the Paschal Anthem: "H&aelig;c dies quam, fecit Dominus exultemus et l&aelig;temur in ea". On his arrival he <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the robe of Mrs. Lyne, who was already dead, saying: "Ah, sister, thou hast got the start of us, but we will follow thee as quickly as we may"; and told the people: "I am come here to die, being a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and a religious man, belonging to the Order of St. Benedict; it was by this same order that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was converted". He was tall and burly of figure, gay and cheerful in disposition. He suffered in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit, under which he wore a hair-shirt. It was noticed that his knees were, like St. James', hardened by constant kneeling, and an apprentice in the crowd picking up his legs, after the quartering, called out to them: "Which of you Gospellers can show such a knee?" Barkworth's devotion to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> led to his suffering much from the hands of the superiors of the Vallalodid College. These sufferings are probably much exaggerated, however, by the anti-Jesuit writers Watson, Barneby, and Bell.
