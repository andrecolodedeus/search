<h1>Ven. Montford Scott</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, b. in Norfolk, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Fleet Street, London, on 2 July, 1591. He went to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a> in 1574, being one of the earliest students at that <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The next year he was made <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and accompanied Dominic Vaughan to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In Essex they fell into the hands of the Government, Dec., 1576, and under examination, Vaughan was weak enough to betray the names of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> both in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and Essex. They were then given over by the Privy Council to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> for further examination, but nothing more was elicited, and they were afterwards set at liberty. Scott returned to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> on 22 May, 1577, and having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> set out for the English mission on 17 June. The vessel in which he crossed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was attacked by pirates, but he escaped with some loss of his goods. He is mentioned as having laboured in Kent (1580), Norfolk, Suffolk (1583), Lincolnshire and Yorkshire (1584). On 24 April, 1584, John Nedeham and others were indicted at <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a> for having on 1 June, 1582, received blessed beads from him. In 1584 he was captured at York at brought to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where he remained a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for seven years. His release was procured by a money payment of one Baker, on condition of his leaving the country, but Topcliffe immediately procured his re-arrest. Meanwhile he had visited the confessors in Wisbeach Castle. He was brought to trail at the sessions at Newgate in company of <a href="../cathen/02389a.htm">Ven. George Beesley</a> (30 June, 1591), ad was condemned on account of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and of his being in the country contrary to the Statute. The next day he was drawn to Fleet Street, where he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Topcliffe said that he had that day done the queen and the kingdom a singular piece of service in ridding the realm of such a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> papist as had not his peer in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.
