<h1>Ven. Philip Howard</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, Earl of Arundel; born at Arundel House, London, 28 June 1557, died in the Tower of London, 19 October, 1595. He was the grandson of Henry, Earl of Surrey, the poet, executed by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1547, and son of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk executed by Elizabeth 1572. <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, then King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was one of his godfathers. His father, who had conformed to the State religion, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> him partly under John Foxe, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> martyrologist and he was afterwards sent to Cambridge. His father having married as his third wife Elizabeth, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Lord Dacre of Gillesland, matched her three daughters who were heiresses, to his three sons. Anne, Philip's wife, Countess of Arundel and Surrey, who survived to 1630, was a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of remarkable generosity and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and became after her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> the patroness of <a href="../cathen/14164a.htm">Father Southwell</a> and of many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and eventually founded the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. Philip succeeded, 24 February, 1580, jure matris, to the Earldom of Arundel, and this may be considered the highest point of his worldly fortunes. He frequented the Court, entertained the queen, and was restored in blood, 1581, though not to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> dukedom. Towards the close of the year he was present at the disputations of <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Blessed Edmund Campion</a> in the Tower and this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the first step in his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, though, like most of Elizabeth's courtiers, his life was then the reverse of virtuous, and for a time he deserted his wife. But the Howards had many enemies and Elizabeth was of their number. As the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival gained strength, the earl found himself suspected and out of favour, and his difficulties were increased by his wife's conversion. He was now reconciled, indeed devoted, to her, and 30 September, 1584, was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by Father William Weston, S.J., and became a fervent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The change of life was soon noticed at Court, on which Philip, seeing the queen more and more averse and dangers thickening, resolved to fly, which he did (14 April, 1585), after composing a long and excellent letter of explanation to Elizabeth. But he was captured at sea, probably through treachery, and confined in the Tower of London (25 April) where he remained till death. He was at first sentenced to a fine of 10,000 pounds, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> at the queen's pleasure. Later on (14 March-14 April 1589), during the bloodthirsty mood which caused the death of so many <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a> after the <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">Armada</a>, he was tried for having favoured the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the queen, and for having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the invaders. As usual at that time, the trial was a tirade against the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, who was of course condemned. One example of the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a> of the prosecution may be mentioned. While they professed to quote the very words of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, "published 1 April", no such <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was published at all. If the <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">Armada</a> had been successful a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> would of course have been issued, and Elizabeth's spies had in fact got hold of an explanation written by Allen in preparation for that event (printed in Dodd-Tierney, iii Ap. 44). From a letter of Attorney-General Popham (R. O. State Papers, Dom. Eliz., ccxxiii, 77) we see that he was aware of the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulent</a> character of the evidence. Philip was left to die in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. His last <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to see his wife and only son, who had been born after his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, was refused except on condition of his coming to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a>, on which terms he might also go free. With this eloquent testimony to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of his cause he expired, at the early age of thirty-eight, and was buried in the same grave in the Tower Church that had received his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and grandfather. In 1624 his bones were translated by his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> to Long Horsley, and thence to Arundel, where they still rest. A portrait by Zucchero is in the possession of the Duke of Norfolk. His "Epistle of Christ to the Faithful Soul" translated from Lanspergius (Johann Justus of Lansberg), was printed at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1595; St-Omer, 1610; London, 1867; his "Fourfold Meditations of Four Last Things" (once attributed to <a href="../cathen/14164a.htm">Southwell</a>), London, 1895; his "Verses on the Passion", by the Cath. Record Soc., VI, 29.
