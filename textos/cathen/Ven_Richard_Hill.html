<h1>Ven. Richard Hill</h1>  

<p>English Martyr, executed at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, 27 May, 1590. Very little is known of him and his fellow-martrys, John Hogg and Richard Holiday, except that they were Yorkshiremen who arrived at the English College at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Holiday on 6 September, 1584, Hill on 15 May, 1587, and Hogg on 15 October, 1587; that all three were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, 18 March, 1859, by Monsignor Jerome Hennequin, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> 27 May and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> 23 September at Laon by Monsignor Valentine Douglas, O.S.B.; that they with their fellow <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Edmund Duke were sent on the English mission on the following 22 March and were arrested in the north of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> soon after landing; that they were arraigned, condemned, and executed at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> under the statute 27 Eliz c. 2. With them suffered four felons who protested that they died in the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <blockquote> Divers beholders, when these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were offered their pardons if they would go to church, said boldly that they would rather die themselves than any of them should relent, one saying (he had seven children) "I would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> they might all go the same way in making such confession" . . . When their heads were cut off and holden up, as the manner is, not one would say "God save the Queen" except the catch-polls themselves and a minister or two. </blockquote>

<p>Two <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> spectators, Robert Maire and his wife Grace, were converted. The place at which they were executed was called Dryburn, and afterwards the legend sprung up that it was so called because the well out of which the water was drawn to boil their quarters suddenly dried up. The place however had this name before their deaths.
