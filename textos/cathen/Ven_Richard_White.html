<h1>Ven. Richard White</h1>  

<p>(<em>Vere</em> GWYN).

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, born at Llanilloes, Montgomeryshire, about 1537; executed at Wrexham, Denbighshire, 15 October, 1584. After a brief stay at Oxford he studied at St. John's College, Cambridge, till about 1562, when he became a schoolmaster, first at Overton in Flintshire, then at Wrexham and other places, acquiring considerable reputation as a <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> scholar. He had six children by his wife Catherine, three of whom survived him. For a time he conformed in religion, but was reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the first coming of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. Owing to his <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusancy</a> he was arrested more than once, and in 1579 he was a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in Ruthin gaol, where he was offered liberty if he would conform. In 1580 he was transferred to Wrexham, where he suffered much <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, being forcibly carried to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> service, and being frequently brought to the bar at different assizes to undergo opprobrious treatment, but never obtaining his liberty. In May, 1583, he was removed to the Council of the Marches, and later in the year suffered torture at Bewdley and Bridgenorth before being sent back to Wrexham. There he lay a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> till the Autumn Assizes, when he was brought to trial on 9 October, and found guilty of treason and sentenced on the following day. Again his life was offered him on condition that he acknowledge the queen as supreme head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His wife consoled and encouraged him to the last. Five carols and a funeral ode composed by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> have recently been discovered and published.
