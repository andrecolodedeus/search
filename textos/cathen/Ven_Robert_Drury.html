<h1>Ven. Robert Drury</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a> (1567-1607), was born of a good Buckinghamshire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and was received into the English College at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 1 April, 1588. On 17 September, 1590, he was sent to the new College at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>; here he finished his studies, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1593. He laboured chiefly in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where his learning and virtue made him much respected among his brethren. He was one of the appellants against the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Blackwell, and his name is affixed to the appeal of 17 November, 1600, dated from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Wisbech. An invitation from the Government to these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to acknowledge their allegiance and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to the queen (dated 5 November, 1602) led to the famous loyal address of 31 January, 1603, drawn up by Dr. William Bishop, and signed by thirteen of the leading <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, including the two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Drury and <a href="../cathen/13116a.htm">Cadwallader</a>. In this address they acknowledged the queen as their lawful sovereign, repudiated the claim of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to release them from their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of allegiance to her, and expressed their abhorrence of the forcible attempts already made to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion and their determination to reveal any further conspiracies against the Government which should come to their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In return they ingenuously pleaded that as they were ready to render to Caesar the things that were Caesar's, so they might be permitted to yield to the successor of Peter that obedience which Peter himself might have claimed under the commission of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and so to distinguish between their several <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> as to be ready on the one hand "to spend their blood in defence of her Majesty", but on the other "rather to lose their lives than infringe the lawful authority of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's Catholic Church</a>". This bold repudiation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> deposing power was condemned by the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>; bit it is noteworthy that its author was selected by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself as the very man in whose <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he would revive the episcopal authority in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Dr. William Bishop being nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a> and first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> in that country in 1623.

<p>The results of the address were disappointing; Elizabeth died within three months of its signature, and James I soon <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he would not be satisfied with any purely civil allegiance. He thirsted for spiritual authority, and, with the assistance of an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, a new <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance was drawn up, which in its subtlety was designed to trouble the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and divide them on the lawfulness of taking it. It was imposed 5 July, 1606, and about this time Drury was arrested. He was condemned for his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but was offered his life if he would take the new <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. A letter from <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons, S.J.</a>, against its lawfulness was found on him. The <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> declared that the "damnable <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>" of the deposing power was "impious and heretical", and it was condemned by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>, 22 September, 1606, "as containing many things contrary to the Faith and Salvation". This brief, however, was suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, and Drury probably did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of it. But he felt that his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> would not permit him to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and he died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> at Tyburn, 26 February, 1606-7. A curious contemporary account of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, entitled "A true Report of the Arraignment . . . of a Popish Priest named Robert Drewrie" (London, 1607), which has been reprinted in the "Harleian Miscellany", calls him a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, and says he wore his monastic habit at the execution. But this "habit" as described proves to be the cassock and cap work by the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The writer adds, "There were certain papers shown at Tyburn which had been found about him, of a very dangerous and traitorous nature, and among them also was his <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> faculty under seal, expressing what power and authority he had from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to make men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children here of his order; what indulgence and pardons he could grant them", etc. He may have been a confrater or oblate of the order.
