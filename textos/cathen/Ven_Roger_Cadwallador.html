<h1>Ven. Roger Cadwallador</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, b. at Stretton Sugwas, near <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, in 1568; executed at Leominster, 27 Aug., 1610. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 21 Sept., 1591, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> the following February, and in Aug., 1592, was sent to the English College at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1594, he laboured in Herefordshire with good success especially among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> for about sixteen years. Search was made for him in June, 1605, but it was not till <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1610, that he was arrested at the house of Mrs. Winefride Scroope, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, within eight miles of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>. He was then brought before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a>, Dr. Robert Bennet, who committed him to <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a> gaol where he was loaded with irons night and day. On being transferred to Leominster gaol he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to walk all the way in shackles, though a boy was permitted to go by his side and bear up by a string the weight of some iron links which were wired to the shackles. On his arrival, he was treated with the greatest inhumanity by his gaoler. He was condemned, merely for being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, some months before he suffered. A very full account of his sufferings in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is given by <a href="../cathen/03564a.htm">Challoner</a>. He hung very long, suffering great pain, owing to the unskilfulness of the hangman, and was eventually cut down and butchered alive. Pits praises his great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek, from which he translated <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret's</a> "Philotheus, or the lives of the Father of the Syrian deserts"; but it does not appear when or where this translation was published.
