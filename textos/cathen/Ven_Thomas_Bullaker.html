<h1>Ven. Thomas Bullaker</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also</em> John Baptist).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a> and <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a> about the year 1604; died at Tyburn, 12 October, 1642. He was the only son of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> as well-to-do physician of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were both fervent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and, following their example, Bullaker grew up in the ways of innocence and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. At an early age he was sent to the English College at St-Omer, and from there he went to Valladolid in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to complete his studies. Convinced of his vocation to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, after much anxious deliberation, he received the habit at Abrojo, and a few years later, in 1628, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Having left <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to labour on the English mission, he landed at <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Plymouth</a>, but was immediately seized and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Liberated after two weeks from the loathsome dungeon where he had suffered the most untoward hardships, Bullaker by order of Father Thomas of St. Francis, then Provincial in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, laboured for nearly twelve years with much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotedness among the poor <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. On the 11th of September, 1642, Bullaker was seized while celebrating the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> in the house of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> benefactress. He has left a partial and but touching account of his apprehension and trial. He was condemned to be drawn on a hurdle to Tyburn and there hanged, cut down alive, quartered and beheaded. It is related that as he was going out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> he met <a href="../cathen/02410b.htm">Ven. Arthur Bell</a>, a religious of his own order, who said to him: "Brother, I was professed before you. Why do you take precedence of me?" Bullaker answered: "It is the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But you will follow me." <a href="../cathen/02410b.htm">Bell</a> remembered the prophetic words of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Bullaker when his own day of martydom was at hand. The cause of the beatification of Bullaker was introduced in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1900.
