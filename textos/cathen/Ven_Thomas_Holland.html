<h1>Ven. Thomas Holland</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, b. 1600 at Sutton, Lancashire; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Tyburn, 12 December, 1642. He was probably son of Richard Holland, gentleman, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omer's</a> and subsequently in August, 1621, went to <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, where he took the missionary <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> 29 December, 1633. When the abortive negotiations for the spanish match were taking place in 1623, Holland was sent to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> to assure Prince Charles of the loyalty of the seminarists of Valladolid, which he did in a Latin oration. In 1624 he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Watten in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and not long after was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. After serving as minister at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> and prefect at <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omer's</a> he was made a spiritual coadjutor at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> (28 May, 1634) and sent on the English mission the following year. He was an adept in disguising himself, and could speak French, Spanish, and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> to perfection but was eventually arrested on suspicion in a <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> street 4 Oct., 1642, and committed to the New Prison. He was afterwards transferred to Newgate, and arraigned at the Old Bailey, 7 December, for being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. There was no conclusive evidence as to this; but as he refused to swear he was not, the jury found him guilty, to the indignation of the Lord Mayor, Sir Isaac Pennington, and another member of the bench named Garroway. On Saturday, 10 December, Sergeant Peter Phesant, presumably acting for the recorder, reluctantly passed sentence on him. On his return to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> great multitudes resorted to him, and he heard many confessions. On Sunday and Monday he was able to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and soon after his last Mass was taken off to execution. There he was allowed to make a considerable speech and to say many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and when the cart was turned away, he was left to hang till he was dead. His brethren called him <em>bibliotheca pietatis</em>.
