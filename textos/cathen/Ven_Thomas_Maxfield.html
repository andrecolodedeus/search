<h1>Ven. Thomas Maxfield</h1>  

<p>(<em>Vere</em> Macclesfield)

<p><a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. in Stafford gaol, about 1590, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Tyburn, London, Monday, 1 July, 1616. He was one of the younger sons of William Macclesfield of Chesterton and Maer and Aston, Staffordshire (a firm <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a>, condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> in 1587 for harbouring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, one of whom was his brother Humphrey), and Ursula, daughter of Francis Roos, of Laxton, Nottinghamshire. William Macclesfield is said to have died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and is one of the <em>pr&aelig;termissi</em> as William Maxfield; but, as his death occurred in 1608, this is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. Thomas arrived at the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> on 16 march, 1602-3, but had to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> 17 May, 1610, owing to ill health. In 1614 he went back to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and in the next year came to London. Within three months of landing he was arrested, and sent to the Gatehouse, Westminster. After about eight months' <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, he tried to escape by a rope let down from the window in his cell, but was captured on reaching the ground. This was at midnight 14- 15 June, 1616. For seventy hours he was placed in the stocks in a filthy dungeon at the Gatehouse, and was then on Monday night (17 June) removed to Newgate, where he was set amongst the worst criminals, two of whom he converted. On Wednesday, 26 June, he was brought to the bar at the Old Bailey, and the next day was condemned solely for being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, under 27 Eliz., c, 2. The Spanish ambassador did his best to obtain a pardon, or at least a reprieve; but, finding his efforts unavailing, had solemn exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> during the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> last night on earth. The procession to Tyburn early on the following morning was joined by many devout <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, who, in spite of insults and mockery, persisted in forming a guard of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Tyburn-tree itself was found decorated with garlands, and the ground round about strewn with sweet herbs. The sheriff ordered the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to be cut down alive, but popular feeling was too strong, and the disembowelling did not take place till he was quite senseless. Half of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are now at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside Abbey</a>, near Bath.
