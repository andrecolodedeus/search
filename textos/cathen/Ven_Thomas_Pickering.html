<h1>Ven. Thomas Pickering</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">Lay brother</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, a member of an old Westmoreland <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, b. c. 1621; executed at Tyburn, 9 May, 1679. He was sent to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Gregory at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he took <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> in 1660. In 1665 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where, as steward or <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> to the little community of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> who served the queen's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> royal, he became known personally to the queen and Charles II; and when in 1675, urged by the parliament, Charles issued a proclamation ordering the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> within a fixed time, Pickering was allowed to remain, probably on the ground that he was not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1678 came the pretended revelations of Titus Oates, and Pickering was accused of conspiring to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the king. No evidence except Oates's word was produced and Pickering's innocence was so obvious that the queen publicly announced her <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in him, but the jury found him guilty, and with two others he was condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. The king was divided between the wish to save the innocent men and fear of the popular clamour, which loudly demanded the death of Oates's victims, and twice within a month the three <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were ordered for execution and then reprieved. At length Charles remitted the execution of the other two, hoping that this would satisfy the people and save Pickering from his fate. The contrary took place, however, and 26 April, 1679, the House of Commons petitioned for Pickering's execution. Charles yielded and the long-deferred sentence was carried out on the ninth of May. A small piece of cloth stained with his blood is preserved among the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside Abbey</a>.
