<h1>Ven. Thomas Pormort</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, b. at Hull about 1559; d. at St. Paul's Churchyard, 20 Feb., 1592. He was probably related to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Pormort of Great Grimsby and Saltfletby, Lincoln shire. George Pormort, Mayor of Grimsby in 1565, had a second son Thomas <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, 7 February, 1566, but this can hardly be the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. After receiving some <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Rheims</a>, 15 January, 1581, and thence, 20 March following, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1587. He entered the household of Owen Lewis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cassano, 6 March, 1587. On 25 April, 1590, Pormort became prefect of studies in the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He was relieved of this office, and started for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 15 September, without waiting for his faculties. Crossing the St. Gotthard Pass, he reached <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> before 29 November. There he became man servant to Mrs. Geoffrey Pole, under the name of Whitgift, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> being his godfather. With her he went to <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, intending to proceed to Flushing, and thence to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He was arrested in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> on St. James's Day (25 July), 1591, but he managed to escape. In August or September, 1591, he was again taken, and committed to Bridewell, whence he was removed to Topcliffe's house. He was repeatedly racked and sustained a rupture in consequence. On 8 February following he was convicted of <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">high treason</a> for being a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and for reconciling John Barwys, or Burrows, haberdasher. He pleaded that he had no faculties; but he was found guilty. At the bar he accused Topcliffe of having boasted to him of indecent familiarities with the queen. Hence Topcliffe obtained a mandamus to the sheriff to proceed with the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a>, though Archbishop Whitgift endeavoured to delay it and make his godson conform, and though (it is said) Pormort would have admitted conference with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The gibbet was erected over against the haberdasher's shop, and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was kept standing two hours in his shirt upon the ladder on a very cold day, while Topcliffe vainly urged him to withdraw his accusation.
