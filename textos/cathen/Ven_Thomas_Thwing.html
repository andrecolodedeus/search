<h1>Ven. Thomas Thwing</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>. Born at Heworth Hall, near <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, in 1635; suffered at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, 23 Oct., 1680. His father was George Thwing, Esq., of Kilton Castle and Heworth, nephew of <a href="../cathen/11171c.htm#thwing">Venerable Edward Thwing</a>; his mother was Anne, sister of the venerable <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessor</a> Sir Thomas Gasciogne, of Barnbrow Hall. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, he was sent to the mission in 1664 and laboured in his native country. Until April, 1668, he was <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at Carlton Hall, the seat of his cousins the Stapletons. He next opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Quosque, the dower-house of the Stapletons. When in 1677 the "Institute of Mary" began their foundation in the house given by Sir Thomas Gasciogne at Dolebank, Thwing became their <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, three of his sisters being of the community. It was there that he was arrested in the early part of 1679. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/11173c.htm">Titus Oates</a> scare, two servants who had been discharged from Sir Thomas Gasciogne's employ for dishonesty, sought vengeance and reward by disclosing a pretend <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> plot on the part of Gasciogne and others to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the king. In their first allegation no mention was made of Thwing. Gasciogne, Thwing, and others were removed to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> for trial at Newgate. All were acquitted except Thwing, who was brought back to York for trial in March, 1680. Owing to his challenging the jurors, his trial was postponed to the summer assizes, and he was brought to the bar on 29 July. He was refused an impartial jury, and was found guilty on the very same evidence upon which his relatives had been acquitted. Upon receiving sentence, which in consideration of his gentle birth was passed on him apart from the felons and murderers found guilty at the same assizes, humbly bowing his head he replied "Innocens ego sum." The king at first reprieved him, but owing to a remonstrance of the Commons the death-warrant was issued on the day after the meeting of Parliament. He was drawn from York Castle, past the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> where the sisters were dwelling, to Tyburn, where the sentence was carried out. He declared his innocence, protested his loyalty to the king and his charity to his neighbour; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the king and royal family, and begged the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. His dying words were "Sweet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, receive my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>". His mangled body ws given to his friends, and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the churchyard of St. Mary, Castlegate. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> are now preserved at the Bar Convent, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/11335c.htm">Oscott College</a>.
