<h1>Ven. Thurston Hunt</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a> (March, 1601), who belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> seated at Carlton Hall, near <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>, and had made his course of studies at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 1583, 1584. Robert Middleton, his fellow-martyr, a nephew of <a href="../cathen/04059b.htm">Margaret Clitheroe</a>, had also studied at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1594-1598. In November, 1600, Middleton was arrested by chance near Preston, and an attempt to rescue him was made by four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, of whom Hunt was one, but the attempt failed, and after a long and exciting tussle, Hunt was captured. They were then both treated with great inhumanity, and heavily ironed night and day until, by the order of the Privy Council, with their feet tied beneath their horses' bellies, they were carried in public disgrace up to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and back again to Lancaster, where they were condemned and executed for their <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. But the attempt to <a href="../cathen/04677c.htm">degrade</a> them in public opinion failed. No one would let out his horse to drag them to the place of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a>; they reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the felons condemned to die with them; their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were eagerly carried off after their death; and a contemporary sang admiringly of <blockquote> Hunt's hawtie corage staut, <br>With godlie zeale soe <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <br>Myld Middleton, O what tongue <br>Can halfe thy vertue showe! </blockquote>
