<h1>Ven. William Andleby</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyred</a> at York 4 July, 1597. He was born at Etton in Yorkshire of a well-known gentle <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. At twenty-five he went abroad to take part in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">SPANISH ARMADA</a>), and called at Douay to interview Dr. Allen, whom he attempted to confute in argument. Next day he recognized that Allen was right, was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and eventually became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Mention is found of his having served at Mr. Tyrwhitt's, in Lincolnshire, and also of his having succoured the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> in Hull blockhouse. "His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was such as to spare no pains and to fear no dangers. For the first four years of his mission he travelled always on foot, meanly attired, and carrying with him usually in a bag his <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> and other things for saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>; for his labours lay chiefly among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, who were not shocked with such things. Afterwards, humbly yielding to the advice of his brethren, he used a horse and went somewhat better clad. Wonderful was the austerity of his life in frequent watchings, fastings, and continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so absorbed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that he often took no notice of those he met; by which means he was sometimes exposed to suspicions and dangers from the enemies of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, into whose hands he at last fell after twenty years' labour in the vineyard of the Lord." (Challoner). He was condemned for his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> character, and suffered, as stated above, with three <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, John Abbot, Thomas Warcop, and Edward Fulthrop.
