<h1>Ven. William Davies</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, one of the most illustrious of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who suffered under Queen Elizabeth, b. in North <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, probably and Croes yn Eris, Denbighshire, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> uncertain; d. at Beaumaris, 27 July, 1593. He studied at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, where he arrived 6 April 1582 just in time to assist a the first Mass of the venerable <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/06385c.htm">Nicholas Garlick</a>. He received <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> 23 Sept., 1583, together with seventy-three other English students. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in April, 1585, he laboured with wonderful <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> till March, 1591-2, when he was arrested at Holyhead with four students whom he was sending via <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to the English College at Valladolid. He was thrown into a loathsome dungeon in Beaumaris Castle and separated from his companions, having frankly confessed that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. After a month his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and patience gained him some relaxation of his close confinement and he was able to join the students for and hour in the day, and even to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. By degrees the jailor became so indulgent that they might have escaped had they so willed. The fame of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and wisdom brought <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from all parts to consult him and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> came to dispute with him. At the assizes he and his companions were condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, on which the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> intoned the <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">"Te Deum"</a>, which the others took up. The <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of the sentence was so apparent that to still the people's murmurs the judge reprieved the condemned till the queen's pleasure be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Sent to Ludlow, to be examined by the Council of the Marches, Father Davies had to submit to fresh assaults by the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. Here too he foiled the artifices of his enemies who took him to the church under pretext of a disputation, and then began the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> service. He at once began to recite the Latin <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> in a louder voice than the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers'</a>, and afterwards publicly exposed the trick of which he had been a victim. From Ludlow he was sent to Bewdley, where he had to share a foul dungeon with felons, and from thence to other <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> until at last he was sent back to Beaumaris, where, to their mutual consolation, he rejoined his young companions. For some six moths he lived with them the life of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community, dividing the time between <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and study, "with so much comfort to themselves that they seemed to be rather in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> than in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>". At the summer assizes it was decided that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> must die as a <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">traitor</a>, though he was offered his life if he would go but once to church. In spite of the then open opposition of the people, who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> him as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, the cruel sentence was carried out and he was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Beaumaris. As he put the rope round his neck, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> said: "Thy yoke, O Lord is sweet and Thy burden is light." His cassock stained with his blood was brought by his companions and preserved as a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>. They, though condemned to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for life, managed in time to escape, and the youngest found his way at last to <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, where he recounted the whole story to Bishop Yepes, who wrote it in his "Historia particular de la Persecucion en Inglaterra". There is now a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in Anglesey built as a memorial to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.
