<h1>Ven. William Hartley</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>; b. at Wyn, in Derbyshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, of a yeoman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> about 1557; d. 5 October, 1588. At eighteen he matriculated at St. John's, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he became a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. Being ejected by the vice-chancellor, Tobie Mathew, in 1579, he went to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in August, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, and returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in June, 1580. He was of great service to Fathers <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a> and <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> in printing and distributing their books, but was eventually arrested, 13 August, 1581, and sent to Marshalsea Prison, London. Here he was detected saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in a cell before Lord Vaux, and for this he was laid in irons (5 December, 1583). He was indicted for high treason, 7 February, 1584, but for some unknown reason, not tried. In January, 1585, he was sent into exile. He then spent some little time at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, recovering his health, and made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (15 April, 1586), before returning to his perilous mission. In September, 1588, he was arrested in Holborn, London, and, as his friend Father Warford said, "being beset by the deceits of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, incurred the suspicion of having <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>. But the event showed how <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> the suspicion was; when he suffered at Tyburn he won the greatest credit for constancy. He was a man of the meekest disposition and naturally virtuous, modest, and grave, with a sober and peaceful look. His <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> was blackish and his height moderate" ("Acts of English Martyrs", cited below, 272).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">Armada</a> year was for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> both the time of worst bloodshed and of the greatest dearth of news, and this explains why we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> but little of Hartley's companions. The first was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07309a.htm">Venerable John Hewitt</a>, son of a draper at York and a student at Caius College, Cambridge. He had once been in York <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, but was arrested in Grey's Inn Lane, London, 10 March, 1857, going under the name of Weldon, and died under that name; this had led several early martyrologists into the curious mistake of making him into two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Hewett dying at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and Weldon at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Hartley's second companion was the Venerable Robert Sutton, a tutor or schoolmaster, born at Kegworth in Leichestershire, who had practiced his profession in <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Paternoster</a> Row, London. The fourth [sic] was John Harrison, <em>alias</em> Symons, who had carried letters from one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to another. As he had before "been <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> to be a spy" we can guess why his fame suffered some obscurity. It is also hardly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> that his name, Harrison, was confounded with that of either Matthias or <a href="../cathen/07143b.htm">James Harrison</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in 1599 or 1602 respectively. This perhaps explains why his name has fallen out of the process of the <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a>, and in its place we find inserted that of Venerable Richard Williams, a "Queen Mary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>" who really suffered four years later.
