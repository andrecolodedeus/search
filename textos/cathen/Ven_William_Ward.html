<h1>Ven. William Ward</h1>  

<p>(Real name WEBSTER).

<p>Born at Thornby in Westmoreland, about 1560; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Tyburn, 26 July, 1641. He was over forty when he went to Douay to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> but no details have been preserved of his earlier life. He arrived there on 18 September, 1604; received the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> on 16 December, 1605; the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> on 26 October, 1607; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> on 31 May, 1608; and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> on the following day. On 14 October he started for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but was driven on to the shores of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, arrested, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for three years. On obtaining his liberty he came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> where he laboured for thirty years, twenty of which he spent in various <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> as a confessor for the Faith. He was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and fiery temperament, severe with himself and others, and especially devoted to hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>. Though he had the reputation of being a very exacting director his earnestness drew to him many penitents. So mortified was his personal life and so secret his numerous charities that he was even accused of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. He was in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> when Parliament issued the proclamation of 7 April, 1641, banishing all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> under pain of death, but refused to retire, and on 15 July was arrested in the house of his nephew. Six days later he was brought to trial at the Old Bailey and was condemned on 23 July. He suffered on the feast of <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">St. Anne</a>, to whom he ever had a great devotion. An oil portrait, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> shortly after the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> from memory or possibly from an earlier sketch, is preserved at <a href="../cathen/11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a>, Old Hall.
