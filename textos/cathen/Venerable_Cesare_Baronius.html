<h1>Venerable Cesare Baronius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, 30 August, 1538; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 30 June, 1607; author of "Annales Ecclesiatici", a work which marked an epoch in historiography and merited for its author, after <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, the title of a Father of Ecclesiastical History.

<p>Baronius was descended from the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> branch of a once powerful <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, whose name, <em>de Barono</em>, was changed by Cesare himself to the Roman form, <em>Baronius.</em> His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> citizens of <a href="../cathen/01662b.htm">Sora</a> in the Sabines, some sixty miles east of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, could bestow no ancestral wealth and power upon their only son. He was, however, to possess qualities which better proclaim nobility &#151; a deeply religious spirit, a charity to which selfishness was painfully repgunant, a firmness of will tempered in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> obedience, and a keenness and vigour of mind scrupulously dedicated to the cause of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. These qualities distinguished Baronius as a peer in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and scholarship among many saintly and learned contemporaries. He inherited his more vigorous traits of character from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Camillo, a worldly and ambitious man, whose strong will and tenacity of purpose were one day to clash with like qualities in his equally determined son. To the influence of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and charitable mother, Portia Phaebonia, whose devotion to Cesare's religious interests was intensified by what she considered his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> deliverance from death in infancy, he owed his conspicuous tender qualities and childlike simplicity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. To this latter was due his vivid realization of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> guidance, vouchsafed often in visions and dreams. Baronius received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from his intelligent <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of nearby Veroli. His intense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of study and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> maturity encouraged his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to send him, at the age of eighteen, to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of law at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. There, after a few months of confusion due to the Franco-Spanish <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for Italian dominion compelled him to remove to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, in 1557, he became a pupil of Cesare Costa, a master in civil and canon law.

<p>He was there but a short time when he met one who was potently to influence his destiny and determine, even to details, his career and occupations. It was Philip Neri, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> remarkable for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and for the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and charity with which he inspired a little group of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and lay-men whom he had formed into a confraternity of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of San Girolamo della Carit&agrave;. The importance of this meeting cannot be overestimated; a Baronius the world might have had, but the Baronius of history is the creature of <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>. He was impressed by the serious law student of such transparent innocence of life and finding in him a responsive subject, enrolled him in his little band. This did not prevent Baronius from continuing the studies for which he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but in all else his surrender of self to Philip's guidance was spontaneous and complete. It was not without its <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. In token of renunciation he burned a volume of his own Italian verses in the composition of which he had shown marked proficiency; the same fate later befell his doctorate diploma. For three years, in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, he yearned to become a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, but Philip restrained him. More distressing still was the bitter antagonism of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who saw in all this but folly and the frustration of his paternal <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. He feared, too, the extinction of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, whose hope for a brilliant revival was centred alone in Cesare. Father and son were firm. Camillo cut off his scanty allowance and Cesare was compelled to live on the hospitality of one of Philip's friends. For six years Baronius led a semi-religious life with the community of San Girolamo, the nucleus of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Congregation of the Oratory</a>. From Philip he received direction in study and spiritual guidance, and at his bidding gave all his spare time to charitable work among the sick and poor.

<p>During the year 1558 Philip assigned to him the important work of preaching at the conferences given often during the week in the church of San Girolamo. In 1564 he received <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and resolved to cast his lot with Philip's little band, but so intense was his ardor for the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> that he had already taken <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and obedience to Philip as to a superior. Of his will he was to be the yielding instrument for yet twenty-five years. That time was to be given to the preparation of his work on <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, about which Baronius' life-interest henceforth centres.

<p>The credit of its conception belongs to Philip, as Baronius testifies with filial devotion in the "Annals". The saint shared keenly in the distress and dismay caused in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles by the publication of the "Centuries of Magdeburg" (Ecclesiastica Historia: integram ecclesiae Christi ideam complectens, congesta per aliquot studiosos et pios viros in urbe Magdeburgica, 13 vols., Basle, 1559-74). The purpose of this work was to commit history to the cause of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> by showing how far the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had departed from primitive teaching and practices, in contrast to the consonance therewith of the Reformed Church. It was conceived in 1552 by Mathias Flach Francowiez (Flacius Illyricus) and, with the collaboration of several <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> scholars and the co-operation of evangelical princes and other wealthy <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, was hurriedly completed. Its thirteen volumes dealt each with a century of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>, whence the name "Centuriators" applied to the authors. Though the work had the great merit of being the pioneer in the field of modernized <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and displayed considerable critical spirit, its unscrupulously partisan colouring of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> claims and its misrepresentations of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> predestined it to but ephemeral <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. It is of interest only as a sunken landmark in the field of historical literature, and as the stimulus of Baronius's genius. The publication of its initial volumes, however, at a time when its polemical value made it acceptable to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, provided the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> with a most formidable weapon of attack on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It did much harm. The feasibility of a counter attack appealed to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars, but nothing adequate was provided, for the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of history was still a thing of the future. Its founder was as yet but twenty-one years of age and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> very little of history. It was in that youth that <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> discerned a possible <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> who would rout the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. He forthwith directed Baronius to devoted his conferences at San Girolamo exclusively to the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>. Baronius was disconcerted. History had no attraction for him. His youthful <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> would rather vent itself in the fiery moral conferences which he had creditably given during the preceding year. But he obeyed, and within three years summarily covered the field of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> in his conference and developed a keen interest in historical studies. Twice he gave the course before his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and five times again did he repeat it during the following twenty-three years, perfecting his work with each succeeding series. The early historians and the Fathers became his familiars. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> yielded to his diligent quest a host of unpublished documents. Monuments, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, and inscriptions told to him unsuspected stories.



<p>What he did in and about <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> willing correspondents did for him elsewhere, and the name of Baronius came to be known over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> as a synonym for unprecedented historical penetration, power of research, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for verification. Philip's plan for arranging in lasting form the material thus garnered must have been made known to Baronius before 1569, but despite the importance of the work, he was compelled by his master to share in all the exercises of the now growing Oratory. At the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini. which he served from 1564 to 1575, he had his part in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> ministrations and took his turn in the menial domestic services. "Baronius coquus perpetuus" was the legend he playfully inscribed in the Oratory kitchen, where he often received distinguished visitors. To the many <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> imposed by Philip he added generously, and thereby provoked the digestive disorders that often racked his body in life and ultimately precipitated his death. Despite all obstacles, his prodigious capacity for work and contentment with but four to five hours sleep a night made possible an amazing progress in his researches. After the canonical foundation of the Oratory (15 July, 1575) he took up his residence at Santa Maria in Vallicella, definitive home of the new congregation, and led the same busy life. In the early eighties plans were matured for the publication of the new <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and by 1584, a quarter of a century since he began his preparation, Baronius had the work well under way, when his patience suffered a new trial. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> confided to him the revision of the Roman Martyrology. The work was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> because of confusion in feast-days due to the <a href="../cathen/03168a.htm">Gregorian calendar-reform</a> (1582); besides, it was an opportune time to correct the many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of copyists long accumulating in the Martyrology. Baronius gave two years to the wide research and keen criticism the work demanded. His annotations and corrections were published in 1586, and in a second edition he corrected several <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which he was chagrined to have overlooked in the first (Martyrologium Romanum, cum Notationibus Caesaris Baronii, Rome, 1589).

<p>The difficulties which beset Baronius in the publication of the "Annals" were many and annoying. He prepared his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> unaided, writing every page with his own hand. His brother <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> could lend him no assistance. Those at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, who helped him in revising his copy, were scarcely competent and almost exasperating in their dilatoriness and uncritical judgment. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> he read himself. His printers, in the infancy of their art, were neither prompt nor painstaking. In the Spring of 1588 the first volume appeared and was universally acclaimed for its surprising wealth of information, its splendid erudition, and its timely vindication of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims. The "Centuries" were eclipsed. Those highest in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> complimented the author, but more gratifying still was the truly phenomenal sale the book secured and the immediate demand for its translation into the principal <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages. It was Baronius' intention to produce a volume every year; but the second was not ready until early in 1590. The next four appeared yearly, the seventh late in 1596, the other five at still-longer intervals, up to 1607, when, just before his death, he completed the twelfth volume, which he had foreseen in a vision would be the term of his work. It brought the history down to 1198, the year of the accession of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>.

<p>Baronius' student life during the twenty years of publication was even more disturbed than formerly. His growing repute brought heavy penalties to one of his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. Three successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> would have made him a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1593 he became superior of the Oratory, succeeding the aged Philip, on whose death, in 1596, he was re-elected for another triennial term. In 1595 <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, whose confessor he was, made him protonotary Apostolic and, on 5 June, 1596, created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Baronius bitterly regretted his removal from the Oratory to reside at the Vatican, or even away from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court was absent from the city, a circumstance doubly distressing as it prevented active work on the "Annals". In 1597 Clement paid the highest possible tribute to his erudition by naming him Librarian of the Vatican. This office, together with the charge of the newly founded Vatican press and his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in the Congregations, left still less time for his "Annals". Troubles he had of another order. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the liberties of the church had early invited the disfavour of <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, who, because he was the strongest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereign in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, was striving to exercise undue influence on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. He incurred Philip's further displeasure by supporting the cause of his enemy, the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> Baronius warmly advocated. The "Annals" were condemned by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. Later on, when he published his treatise on the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> Monarchy, proving the prior claim of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the suzerainty of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, he provoked the bitter hostility of both Philip II and Philip III. He found solace, however, in the thought that the enmity of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> would prevent the growing possibility of his being made <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This hope was severely tried in the two <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> of 1605. Baronius was the choice of a majority of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and, despite Spanish opposition, might have been elected had he not turned his diplomacy to encompass his own defeat. Thirty-seven votes out of a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> forty in the first <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> and a violent attempt to precipitate his "adoration" in the second attest the esteem in which he was held.

<p>In the spring of 1607 Baronius returned to the Oratory, for a vision had warned him that his sixty-ninth year would be his last, and he had reach the portended last volume of the "Annals". Soon, critically ill, he was removed to <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, but, discerning the end, he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he died 30 June, 1607. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is at the left of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Vallicella (Chiesa Nuova).

<p>Cardinal Baronius left a reputation for profound <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> which led <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> to proclaim him "Venerable" (12 January, 1745). The restorations which he made in his titular church of Sts. Nereus and Achilleus and in St. Gregory's on the Coelian still feebly bespeak his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for decorous worship. But the "Annals" constitute the most conspicuous and enduring monument of his genius and devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For three centuries they have been the inspiration of students of history and an inexhaustible storehouse for research. No one work has treated so completely the epoch with which they deal. Nowhere are there to be found collected so many important documents. Unbiased scholars recognize in them the foundation-stone of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and in their author the qualities of the model historian: indefatigable diligence in research, passion for verification, accuracy of judgment, and unswerving loyalty to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Even in the bitter controversies which the early volumes aroused, Baronius' most scholarly critics acknowledged his thoroughness and honesty. But this does not imply that the work was faultless or final, Master though he was, Baronius was a pioneer. Gifted with a critical spirit which was, to say the least, much keener than that of his contemporaries, his exercise of it was tentative and timid. Yet he stimulated a spirit of criticism which would infallibly advance the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of history far beyond the reaches attainable by himself. With this wider vision his successors have been enabled to subject the "Annals" to no little corrective criticism. His scanty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek and Hebrew limited his resources in dealing with Oriental questions. Despite his care, he cited many documents as authentic which a more enlightened criticism has rejected as <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. His most serious defects were incident to the very accuracy he essayed in casting his history in the strictly annalistic form. The attempt to assign to each successive year its own events involved him in numerous chronological <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Baronius himself recognized the possibility of this and made many corrections in his second edition (Mainz, 1601-05); and later it was by his allies, and not by his enemies, that the most thorough efforts at chronological revision were made, a point seemingly lost on those who refer to Pagi's "refutation" of Baronius' <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. One has but to recall the diversity of opinion in matters of <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> among the chief exponents of historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> today to find palliation for the mistakes of that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science's</a> founder. Whatever must be said in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to Baronius, it remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the present-day value of his work is to be measured in the light of these defects, and it is to the critical editions of the "Annals" that the student will profitably refer, bearing always in mind that the mistakes of Baronius affect but little the value of the precious legacy his industry and genius handed down to later historians. The most extensive work of emendation is that of the Pagi: "Critica historico-chronologica in Annales", etc. (3d ed., Antwerp, 1727, 4 vols.). Its preface contains a good study of the early criticism of the "Annals".

<p>To the original twelve volumes of the "Annals" there have been added continuations in the style of Baronius. The most worthy are those of the three <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>: Raynaldus, ablest of the continuators, who with material accumulated by Baronius carried the history to the year 1565 (Rome, 1646-77, 9 vols.); <a href="../cathen/08736b.htm">Laderchi</a>, who continued it thence to 1571 (Rome, 1728-37, 3 vols.); and August <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a>, to 1583 (Rome, 1856). Less notable are the continuations of the Polish <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Bzovius, 1198 to 1571 (Cologne, 1621-30, 9 vols.), and the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/14235a.htm">Sponde</a>, 1198 to 1647 (Paris, 1659). There is a good study of the work of the continuators by Mansi in the Bar-le-Duc edition of Baronius, XX, p iii-xi. Many epitomes of the work have been made, the best being that of <a href="../cathen/14235a.htm">Sponde</a> (Cologne, 1690, 2 vols.). As an exemplar of recent scientific working of a small portion of the field covered by Baronius may be cited, Rauschen, "Jahrb&uuml;cher der Christlichen Kirche unter dem Kaiser Theodosius dem Grossen. Versuch einer Erneuerung der Annales Ecelesiastici des Baronius f&uuml;r die Jahre 378-395" (Freiburg im Br., 1897). The best editions of Baronius are those of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> (1738-59, 38 vols.) and Bar-le-Duc (1864-83, 37 vols.); the former contains the continuations of Raynald and <a href="../cathen/08736b.htm">Laderchi</a>, the critique of Pagi and others, and is enriched by the notes of Archbishop Mansi; the latter contains what is best in the former and the editorial additions of Father <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a>, whose continuation was to be included. Publication was suspended with the history of the year 1571. Baronius published many lesser works, most of which found place in the "Annals". His life of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> is in Acta SS., XV, 371-427.
