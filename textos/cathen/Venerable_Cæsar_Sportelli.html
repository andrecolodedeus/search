<h1>Venerable C&aelig;sar Sportelli</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a> in <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 29 March, 1702; died at Pagani, 19 April, 1750. His mother, who died with the reputation of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, brought C&aelig;sar up with all care. He became a distinguished lawyer, uniting the <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfection of a Christian life</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his profession. He was thirty-three when under the guidance of Fr. Falcoia of the "Pii Operarii" he joined <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>, and was the first <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> institute. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by his director, now become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03408a.htm">Castellamare</a>. Sportelli was St. Alphonsus's first and most faithful companion. When others abandoned him, Sportelli only clung more closely to him and like himself was determined, at any cost, to devoted his life to the evangelization of abandoned <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In this he succeeded admirably, nor was he less successful in his work for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious. Severe with himself, he was full of charity to others. There was nothing austere in his virtue: it drew all hearts to him. His union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was manifest, and although he preached the great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> with vehemence he repelled no one. He was the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> advisor and helped him more than anyone else to extend the influence of his Institute. In times of great difficulty he founded the house of <a href="../cathen/10041a.htm">Mater</a> Domini, Caposele, and the house of Pagani in which St. Alphonsus lived and died and where his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> repose. He wore himself out working and on his way to preach a retreat he was struck by apoplexy in a lonely place. Bandits helped him to reach Pagani, where after a tedious illness he died on the day he had foretold. Three years and seven months after his interment it was decided to transfer his remains to a place in a newly built <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>. The coffin was opened in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11086c.htm">Nocera</a>, Right Rev. Gerard Volpe, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Angri, D. Thomas Cortora, and others. The vestments in which the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had been clothed turned to dust, while the body was in perfect preservation, flexible and exhaling a sweet fragrance. The countenance was beautiful and when a vein was opened blood flowed just as if he were living. St. Alphonsus wished to take steps at once for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, but was prevented from doing so by many difficulties. It was not till 1899 that the cause was introduced and that he was declared venerable.
