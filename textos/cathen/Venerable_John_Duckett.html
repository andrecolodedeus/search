<h1>Venerable John Duckett</h1>  

<p>A Martyr, probably a grandson of <a href="../cathen/05182b.htm">Venerable James Duckett</a>, born at Underwinder, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Sedbergh, Yorkshire, in 1603; died 7 September, 1644. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1639 and afterwards went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where he studied three years in the College of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>. He had an extraordinary gift of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and while yet a student would spend whole nights in contemplation. On his way to the English mission, he spent two months in spiritual exercises, under the direction of his uncle, the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> prior at Nieuport. He laboured for about a year in <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> and was taken near Whisingham on his way to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> two children, 2 July, 1644. The place which tradition declares to be that of his arrest is now marked by a tall stone cross. Carried to Sunderland, he was examined by a Parliamentary Committee of sequestrators, and placed in irons. He confessed his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and was thereupon sent up to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> with <a href="../cathen/04355c.htm">Father Ralph Corbie, S.J.</a>, who had been arrested about the same time near Newcastle-on-Tyne. They were committed to Newgate, and edified the crowds of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who flocked to see them by their joyousness, their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and their longing to suffer for Christ. A reprieve for one of them having been obtained, each refused to take it for himself. On his way to execution, Duckett astonished all by his <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; comforting those who wept for him, he said smiling: "Why weep you for me who am glad at heart of this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> day?" His jailers even were so struck by his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> that they exclaimed "assuredly this man dies for a good cause". He suffered with <a href="../cathen/04355c.htm">Father Corbie</a>, at Tyburn. In a farewell letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, he wrote on the eve of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>: "I fear not death, nor I contemn not life. If life were my lot, I would endure it patiently; but if death, I shall receive it joyfully, for that Christ is my life, and death is my gain. Never since my receiving of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> did I so much fear death as I did life, and now, when it approacheth can I faint?"
