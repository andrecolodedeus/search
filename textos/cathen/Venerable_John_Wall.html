<h1>Venerable John Wall</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, born in Lancashire, 1620; suffered near <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, 22 August, 1679; known at Douay and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as John Marsh, and when on the Mission under the <em>aliases</em> of Francis Johnson, Webb, and Dormore. The son of wealthy and staunch Lancashire <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, he was sent when very young to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a>. He entered the Roman College, 5 November, 1641, was made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 3 December, 1645, and sent to the Mission, 12 May, 1648. On 1 Jan., 1651, he received the habit of St. Francis at St. Bonaventure's Friary, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and a year later was professed, taking the name of Joachim of St. Anne. He filled the offices of vicar and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> master at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> until 1656, when he returned to the Mission, and for twenty years laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> in Worcestershire. He was apprehended, December, 1678, at Rushock Court near Bromsgrove, where the sheriff's man came to seek a debtor; his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> character transpiring, he was tendered the Oath of Supremacy, and was committed to <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> Gaol for refusing it. He was brought to trial at the Assizes, 25 April, on the charges of receiving and exercising his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and of refusing the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>. A man whose vices he had reproved bore testimony to his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and he received sentence. He was then sent to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and four times examined by Oates, Bedloe, and others in the hope of implicating him in the pretended plot; but was declared innocent of all plotting and offered his life if he would <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> his religion. Brought back to <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, he was executed at Redhill. On the day previous, William Levison was enabled to confess and communicate him, and at the moment of execution the same <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> gave him the last <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. His quartered body was given to his friends, and was buried in St. Oswald's churchyard. Mr. Levison, however, secured the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> head, and it was treasured by the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> until the dissolution of that house in the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Taunton possess a tooth and a bone of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. The long speech he composed for his execution was circulated among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> after his death; and the authorities issued as a broadsheet the public account of his execution containing "a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> copy of the speech...with animadversions upon the same". In 1879 a rood was erected in his memory in the churchyard at Harvington, whose hall was the usual home of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.
