<h1>Venerable Joseph Passerat</h1>  

<p>Born 30 April, 1772, at <a href="../cathen/08495b.htm">Joinville</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died 30 October, 1858. The difficulties he had to Surmount in following his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were great. He was driven from the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and forced to serve in the army from 1788 to 1792. Owing to his lofty stature he was made drum-major, and later quarter-master. At the first opportunity he left the service and entered the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a> in <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Bl. Clement M. Hofbauer</a> trained him for the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and he in turn trained new-comers. Later with great difficulty owing to the circumstances of the times he established houses outside of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. After the death of Bl. Clement, Venerable Passerat succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> over all the transalpine communities. While thus engaged (1820-48) he founded houses in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Difficulties were many in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the danger of suppression was imminent, but never wavering, he communicated his confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to his subjects. He used to say: "Console yourselves, we are seed, be it that we are reduced to ten, these like grains of corn reduced to dust under the earth will one day give a rich harvest". The growth of the congregation verified his prediction. He governed his numerous <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, wisdom, and tenderness. When the revolution decreed the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, he said to his subjects: "Fear not: stand <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a>. Let it not be said of us that we have failed to meet <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> has failed to meet us". On 6 April, 1848, he was driven out of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> with his community without the bare necessaries of life. After much hardship he reached <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Worn out with old age and labour he resigned his office and became director of the <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptoristines</a> at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. The ordinary process for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was begun at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> in 1892, and the introduction of the cause of this venerable servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was approved by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 13 May, 1901. The Apostolic Process is already completed.
