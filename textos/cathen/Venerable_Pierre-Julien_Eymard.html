<h1>Venerable Pierre-Julien Eymard</h1>  

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/14111a.htm">Society of the Blessed Sacrament</a>, and of the Servants of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, born at La Mure d'Is&egrave;re, <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Diocese of Grenoble</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 4 February, 1811; died there 1 Aug., 1868. From early childhood he gave evidence of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and most tender devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. In 1829, he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the Oblates of Mary, but illness compelled him to return home. At the age of twenty he entered the grand <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 20 July, 1834. He returned to the Marist <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in 1839. In 1845 he was appointed Provincial of the Oblates of Mary. His entire spiritual life was centred round the Eucharist. It was the subject of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and exhortations, the object of his worship and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Those who fell under his <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> were taught by his counsel to fix their attention on the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>.

<p>In January of 1851 P&egrave;re Eymard made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the shrine of Our Lady of Fourvi&egrave;res, and there promised Mary to devoted his life to founding a congregation of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whose principal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> should be to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. Having obtained the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> permission, he procured a small house in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in which he and a single companion took up their abode. Here, on 6 Jan., 1857, the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was exposed, and the nascent community of two members commenced the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> as prescribed by their rule. Their founder received his first encouragement for the work in a laudatory <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, blessing the work and its author, and signed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in 1857. Five years after, in 1862, P&egrave;re Eymard had enough spiritual sons to open a regular <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. From this date the congregation spread rapidly, until now its houses may be found in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and South America. The Servants of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, a congregation of <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who carry on perpetual adoration in their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, were also founded by him in 1858. The <a href="../cathen/12422b.htm">Priests' Eucharistic League</a> and the Archconfraternity of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> are evidences of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. P&egrave;re Eymard's writings have been collected, and form four volumes: "The Real Presence", which has been translated into English; Retreat at the Feet of Jesus Eucharistic", "La Sainte Communion", and "L'Eucharistie et la Perfection Chr&eacute;tienne". These writings have received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The author was declared Venerable, 11 August, 1908, and the process for P&egrave;re Eymard's <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> is now in progress.
