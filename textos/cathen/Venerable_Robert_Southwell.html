<h1>Venerable Robert Southwell</h1>  

<p>Poet, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; born at Horsham St. Faith's, Norfolk, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in 1561; hanged at Tyburn, 21 February, 1595. His grandfather, Sir Richard Southwell, had been a wealthy man and a prominent courtier in the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. It was Richard Southwell who in 1547 had brought the poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, to the block, and Surrey had vainly begged to be allowed to "fight him in his shirt". Curiously enough their respective grandsons, Father Southwell and <a href="../cathen/07503a.htm">Philip, Earl of Arundel</a>, were to be the most devoted of friends and fellow-prisoners for the Faith. On his mother's side the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> was descended from the Copley and Shelley <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, whence a remote connexion may be established between him and the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Robert Southwell was brought up a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and at a very early age was sent to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he was the pupil in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> of extraordinary austerity of life, the famous <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Leonard Lessius</a>. After spending a short time in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he begged for admission into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>--a boon at first denied. This disappointment elicited from the boy of seventeen some passionate laments, the first of his verses of which we have record. On 17 Oct., 1578, however, he was admitted at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and made his simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in 1580. Shortly after his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a>, during which he was sent to <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to finish his studies, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1584, and became prefect of studies in the English College. In 1586 he was sent on the English mission with <a href="../cathen/06386b.htm">Father Henry Garnett</a>, found his first refuge with Lord Vaux of Harrowden, and was known under the name of Cotton.

<p>Two years afterwards he became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Countess of Arundel and thus established relations with her <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> husband, <a href="../cathen/07503a.htm">Philip, Earl of Arundel</a>, the ancestor of the present ducal house of Norfolk, as well as with Lady Margaret Sackville, the earl's half-sister. Father Southwell's prose elegy, "Triumphs over Death", was addressed to the earl to console him for this sister's premature death, and his "Hundred Meditations on the love of God", originally written for her use, were ultimately transcribed by another hand, to present to her daughter Lady Beauchamp. Some six years were spent in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and successful missionary work, during which Father Southwell lay hidden in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, or passed under various disguises from one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> house to another. For his better protection he affected an interest in the pursuits of the country gentlemen of his day (metaphors taken from hawking are common in his writings), but his attire was always sober and his tastes simple. His character was singularly gentle, and he has never been accused of taking any part either in political intrigues or in religious disputes of a more domestic kind. In 1592 Father Southwell was arrested at Uxendon Hall, Harrow, through the treachery of an unfortunate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> girl, Anne Bellamy, the daughter of the owner of the house. The <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Topcliffe, who effected the capture, wrote exultingly to the queen: "I never did take so weighty a man, if he be rightly used". But the atrocious cruelties to which Southwell was subjected did not shake his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. He was examined thirteen times under torture by members of the Council, and was long confined in a dungeon swarming with vermin. After nearly three years in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> he was brought to trial and the usual punishment of hanging and quartering was inflicted.

<p>Father Southwell's writings, both in prose and verse, were extremely popular with his contemporaries, and his religious pieces were sold openly by the booksellers though their authorship was known. Imitations abounded, and Ben Jonson declared of one of Southwell's pieces, "The Burning Babe", that to have written it he would readily forfeit many of his own poems. "Mary Magdalene's Tears", the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit's</a> earliest work, licensed in 1591, probably represents a deliberate attempt to employ in the cause of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> the euphuistic prose style, then so popular. "Triumphs over Death", also in prose, exhibits the same characteristics; but this artificiality of structure is not so marked in the "Short Rule of Good Life", the "Letter to His Father", the "Humble Supplication to Her Majesty", the "Epistle of Comfort" and the "Hundred Meditations". Southwell's longest poem, "St. Peter's Complaint" (132 six-line stanzas), is imitated, though not closely, from the Italian "Lagrime di S. Pietro" of Luigi Tansillo. This with some other smaller pieces was printed, with license, in 1595, the year of his death. Another volume of short poems appeared later in the same year under the title of "Maeoniae". The early editions of these are scarce, and some of them command high prices. A poem called "A Foure-fold Meditation", which was printed as Southwell's in 1606, is not his, but was written by his friend the <a href="../cathen/07503a.htm">Earl of Arundel</a>. Perhaps no higher testimony can be found of the esteem in which Southwell's verse was held by his contemporaries than the fact that, while it is probable that Southwell had read <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, it is practically certain that <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a> had read Southwell and imitated him.
