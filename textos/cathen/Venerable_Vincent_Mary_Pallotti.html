<h1>Venerable Vincent Mary Pallotti</h1>  

<p>The founder of the <a href="../cathen/12107a.htm">Pious Society of Missions</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 21 April, 1798 [other sources say 1785 --<em>Ed.</em>]; died there, 22 Jan., 1850. He lies buried in the church of San Salvatore in Onda. He was descended from the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the Pallotti of <a href="../cathen/11101a.htm">Norcia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His early studies were made at the Pious Schools of San Pantaleone, whence he passed to the Roman College. At the age of sixteen, he resolved to become a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, and on 16 May, 1820, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. He celebrated his first Mass in the church of the Ges&ugrave; in <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>. On 25 July he became a Doctor of Theology, and was soon made a substitute professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the Roman Archigymnasium. He gave promise of being a distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, but decided to dedicate himself entirely to pastoral work.

<p>Rome had in him a second Philip Neri. Hearing confessions and preaching were his constant occupations. From morning until night he could be seen hurrying along the streets of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist at the bedside of the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, to bring aid and comfort to the poor in their miserable dwellings, or to preach to the unfortunates in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Once he went so far as to disguise himself as an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in order to reach the bedside of a dying young man, who had a pistol under his pillow ready to kill the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who should approach him. During the cholera plague in 1837, Pallotti constantly endangered his life in ministering to the stricken. After a day spent in apostolic labour he was accustomed to pass almost the whole night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, disciplining himself even to blood, and sleeping for a few hours on a chair or on the bare floor. The most distinguished representatives of the Roman aristocracy, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and even Popes <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> him, but the only advantage he took of their friendship was to advocate the claims of the poor. Even as a young man, he often returned home barefooted, after having given away half his clothing in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; and more than once was he known to have given away his bed to the needy. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, who spoke from his personal observations, said he would not hesitate to consider him a saint. Shortly after his death the preparatory examinations for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> began; in 1887 he was declared Venerable. [He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1962 --<em>Ed.</em>]

<p>It was Venerable Pallotti who started in 1836 the special observance at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the Octave of the Epiphany. Since then the celebration has been faithfully maintained. Pallotti's chief desire was to make this observance a means of uniting the dissenting <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
