<h1>Venerable William Harrington</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>; b. 1566; d. 18 February, 1594. His father had entertained <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> at the ancestral home, Mount St. John, early in 1581. Though the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> did not persevere in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the youngest son never forgot <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion's</a> example. He went abroad, first the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, then to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> (1582-1584) and would have joined the order had not his health broken down and forced him to keep at home for the next six or seven years. In February, 1591, however, he was able to return once more to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and, having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, returned at midsummer 1592. Next May he fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>, and nine months later suffered at Tyburn, after having given <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of unusal constancy and noblemindedness in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, at the bar, and on the scaffold. It was, we may suspect, this very heroism, which induced a posthumous <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniator</a>, Friswood or Fid Williams, an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life, to say that he had had a child by her before he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (see Harsnet, cited below). If the charge had stood alone, it might have been difficult to refute it now. Fortunately for us, Fid had joined to it many other base and certainly untenable accusations, both against him and also against the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body. Her assertions must therefore be everywhere suspected, and in Harrington's case entirely rejected, as Father Morris (cited below) clearly proves. It is also noteworthy considering the frequency with which foul accusations were made in those days, that this is the only one against an <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a> remaining on record.
