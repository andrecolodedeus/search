<h1>Venerables John Cornelius and Companions</h1>  

<p>John Cornelius (called also Mohun) was born of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at Bodmin, in Cornwall, on the estate of Sir John Arundell, of Lanherne, in 1557; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/05133c.htm">Dorchester</a>, 4 July, 1594. Sir John Arundell took an interest in the talented boy and sent him to Oxford. Not satisfied with the new religion taught there, John Cornelius went to the great "seminary of martyrs", then at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and a little later, on 1 April, 1580, entered the <a href="../cathen/05472b.htm">English College, Rome</a>, to pursue his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he was sent as a missionary to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and laboured there for nearly ten years. He practised <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, was devoted to meditation, and showed much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the ministry. While acting as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Lady Arundell, he was arrested on 24 April, 1594, at Chideock Castle, by the sheriff of Dorsetshire. He was met on the way by Thomas Bosgrave, a relative of the <a href="../cathen/01765c.htm">Arundell family</a>, who offered him his own hat, as he had been dragged out bareheaded. Thereupon Bosgrave was arrested. Two servants of the castle, John (or Terence) Carey and Patrick Salmon, natives of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, shared the same fate. When they reached the sheriff's house a number of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> heaped abuse upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, but were so well answered that the sheriff stopped the disputation. The missionary was sent to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and brought before the Lord Treasurer, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and others, who, by words and torture, tried in vain to obtain the names of such as had given him shelter or assistance. He was brought back to Dorchester and with his three companions condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, 2 July, 1594. He was accused of high treason, because he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and had returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; the others were charged with felony, for having rendered assistance to one whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; but all were assured that their lives would be spared if they embraced <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.

<p>While in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, John Cornelius was admitted to membership in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. On the way to execution none of the confessors showed signs of fear. The first to ascend the scaffold was John Carey; he <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the rope, exclaiming "O precious collar", made a solemn profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and died a valiant death. Before his execution Patrick Salmon, a man much admired for his virtues, exhorted the spectators to embrace the Faith, for which he and his companions were giving their lives. Then followed Thomas Bosgrave, a man of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, who delivered a stirring address on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. The last to suffer was John Cornelius, who <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the gallows with the words of St. Andrew, "O Cross, long desired", etc. On the ladder he tried to speak to the multitude, but was prevented. After <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for his executioners and for the welfare of the queen, John Cornelius also was executed. The body was taken down and quartered, his head was nailed to the gibbet, but soon removed. The bodies were buried by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
