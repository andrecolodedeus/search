<h1>Veni Creator Spiritus</h1>  

<p>The "most famous of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>" (Frere), is assigned in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> to <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> (I and II) and <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a> of Pentecost and throughout the octave. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also sings it at such solemn functions as the election of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the dedication of churches, the celebration of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> or councils, the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of kings, etc. It is also sung in the more <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotions</a> attending the opening and closing of that scholastic year in institutions of learning. The Congregation of Rites decreed (20 June, 1899) that the Eastertide <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> (Deo Patri sit gloria &#151; Et Filio qui a mortuis &#151; Surrexit ac Paraclito &#151; In s&aelig;culorum s&aelig;cula) should always be used, no matter what, the feast or season of the year might be. The Vatican Graduale (1908) gives the older text, (attestation of which does not go back beyond the ninth century) and also, under the heading "secundum usum recentiorem", the present <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> text, which is a revision, in the interest of classical prosody, of the older text, by the correctors of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> under <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> of the older text (which is probably not original with the text itself) is: "Sit laus Patri cum Filio &#151; Sancto simul Paraclito &#151; Nobisque mittat Filius &#151; Charisma Sancti Spiritus". This <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> is generally associated with the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Beata nobis gaudia". It is unnecessary to indicate here the points of revision, since the printing of both texts in the Vatican Graduale makes comparison easy. Hymnologists think the revision uncalled for.

<p>Dreves (Analecta Hymnica, L, 195) places the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> in the section he devotes to <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> (d. 856), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and shows (p. 194) the importance of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> evidence in his favour. Frere (Introduction to Hymns Ancient and Modern, historical edition, p. xxii) thinks the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> can with some confidence" be ascribed to him; as does also Blume (1908). Added support of the ascription is found in the scansion of the line Qui Paracletus dicitur (revised into Qui dicitur Paraclitus"), where, in accordance with precedent found in Rabanus, <em>Paracletus</em> is accented on the penultimate syllable, as against the almost universal <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> custom of accenting it on the ante-penultimate, an illustration of which is found in the third line of the <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> (which is not part of the original <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>). <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Gu&eacute;ranger</a> with many others, ascribed the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, but with slight ground except his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Procession of the Holy Ghost from Father and Son. The legendary story of Ekkehard V contains its own refutation. The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> has also been attributed to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, but without real evidence for either ascription. No ancient writer ascribes it to St. Ambrose, nor can a good argument be based on its inclusion of two lines (Infirma nostri corporis &#151; Virtute firmans perpeti) from the "Veni Redemptor gentium" (which is certainly by St. Ambrose) or on the phrasal similarity of its two lines "Accende lumen sensibus &#151; Infunde amorem cordibus" with the line "Infunde lumen cordibus" of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "O lux beata Trinitas" (which is probably by St. Ambrose). Borrowing from celebrated <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> was a common practice of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> hymnodists. <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a> ascribes it to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> because of its classical metre and occasional rhymes, and especially its prayerfulness, which he declares is a feature of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>; and the scansion of <em>Paracletus</em> (with the accent on the penultimate) he considers referable to the learning of such an author.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> was probably first assigned to <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. One eleventh-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> has it at both <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, two others have it at <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>. Its use at <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a> is said to have begun at Cluny &#151; a highly appropriate assignment, as it thus commemorates the descent of the Holy Ghost at the third hour of the day (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs15">Acts 2:15</a>). In the council held at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1049, <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> presiding, it was sung at the commencement of the third session in place of the ordinary antiphon, "Exaudi nos, Domine . It is found in several pontificals of the same century. It is the only <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> retained by the <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Protestant Episcopal Church</a>, a translation being given in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book (Ordering of Priests). There are about sixty English versions. Warton styles the translation of <a href="../cathen/05167b.htm">Dryden</a> most elegant and beautiful. It begins: <blockquote> Creator Spirit, by whose aid <br>The world's foundations first were laid, <br>Come visit every <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mind, <br>Come pour Thy joys on human kind; <br>From <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and sorrow set us free, <br>And make Thy <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> worthy Thee. </blockquote>

This characteristic trait, and the exceptional beauty of the hymn, have always made it dear and venerable to Holy Church . . . The Dominicana sing it only at Terce. Other manuscripts locate it at Matins. The ancient Ordinarium of Laon indicates its use a all the canonical hours. The nuns of the Paraclete (Nogent-sur-Seine) repeated the first stanza seven times at Terce, five times at Sext, and thrice at None."
