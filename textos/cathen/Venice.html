<h1>Venice</h1>  

<p>Venice, the capital of a province in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, is formed of a group of 117 small islands joined together by 378 bridges mostly built of stone. These islands are partly natural, partly artificial, constructed by means of piles driven into the bottom of the shallow sea, as all the houses of the city are built upon a network of rows of piles. The islands are separated by a number of canals, three of which are larger than others; the Grand Canal, which traverses the city in the shape of a letter S, the Giudecca, and the S. Marco, which is the widest of all. The city is connected with the mainland by a railroad which crosses the lagoon on a bridge 2 miles 2555 feet in length. Transportation within the city is carried on by means of gondolas and also, on the three large canals, by small steamers. The lagoon of Venice is divided into the "dead" and the "living". The former (<em>Laguna Morta</em>) is a system of little salt lakes and marshes formed by the sedimentary deposits of the streams flowing down from the Alps, and extends from the mouth of the Po to that of the Isonzo; the latter (<em>Laguna Viva</em>) is a shallow body of salt water out of which rises a few small islands, among them the group which forms the city itself. The <em>Laguna Viva</em> is separated from the Adriatic by a narrow strip of land (the Lido) which extends from <a href="../cathen/03689a.htm">Chioggia</a> to Cortellazzo at the mouth of the Piave. The strip of land is reinforced at many points with Istrian marble, and has a number of openings for the passage of ships, being thus broken up into the several Lidi of Pellestrina, Malmocco, and S. Erasmo. There is a tide in the "live" lagoon, rising at certain times to a height of between 9 and 10 feet, when it floods the pavements of Venice. The city is a commercial and military port girdled by six forts distributed about the <em>Laguna Viva.</em>
<h2>Churches</h2>

<p>St. Marks's, which, since 1807, has also been the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was built in 829, when Venetian merchants purchased the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Mark at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. In the eleventh century it was remodelled in imitation of the Basilica of the Apostles at Constantinople. The succeeding centuries, especially the fourteenth, all contributed to its adornment, and seldom did a Venetian vessel return from the Orient without bringing a column, capitals, or friezes, taken from some ancient building, to add to the fabric of the basilica. Its whole pavement is <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>; it contains gold, bronze, and the greatest variety of stones. The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is decorated with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of different periods, Byzantine <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. The four horses of gilded bronze above the great doorway once adorned the Arch of Trajan; they were transferred to the Hippodrome at Constantinople, and in 1204 <a href="../cathen/04619a.htm">Enrico Dandolo</a> brought them to Venice. The <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the atrium and the interior belong partly to the tenth century. The plan of the interior consists of three longitudinal and three transverse <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>. Over the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is a baldacchino on columns decorated with eleventh-century reliefs; the altarpiece is the famous <em>Pala d'oro</em> (Golden Pall), Byzantine metal- work of the year 1105, originally designed for an antependium. Behind the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is another altar with alabaster columns. The choir stalls are embellished with inlaying by Fra Sebastiano Schiavone, and above them on both sides are three reliefs by <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a>. On the two marble <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> are statuettes by the Massegne brothers (1394). Also in the choir are <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino's</a> bronze <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Caliari's</a> of the Four Doctors. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> is underneath the choir. In the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> is a beautiful font with a bronze cover by Tiziano Minio, Desiderio da Firenze, and Francesco Segala (sixteenth century). The <em>Capella Zeno</em> (mausoleum of Cardinal Zeno, 1501) is the work of Al. Leopardi, Ant. Lombardi, and Paolo Savino. In the treasury of St. Mark's is an episcopal chair of the seventh century. The campanile, 321 1/3 feet high, was built in 900 and repeatedly restored. <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a> added the graceful <em>loggetta</em> in 1540. In 1902 the campanile fell, damaging the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of St. Mark's; it has now (1912) risen again to its ancient splendour.

These churches are in the Barocco style with a profusion of many-coloured marbles in which all the magnificence of Venice is displayed. In the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style are: S. Stefano (fourteenth century, restored in 1904; contains marble balustrade with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> by Lombardi; Madonna dell' Orto [1460; pictures by Tintoretto, who is buried there, Dan. <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>, the younger Palma (Giovane), Giov.

The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (seventh and tenth centuries) of Torcello is worthy of mention, with its <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the twelfth century.

The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, the work of Longhena (1670), contains a museum of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and a picture gallery; its faculty confers degrees in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and canon law.


<h2>Non-religious buildings</h2>

<p>The Palace of the Doges is said to date from the ninth century; its actual form, a singularly graceful type of Gothic, dates from the fifteenth and fourteenth. Chief among the artists who wrought upon it are Pierpaolo Massegne, the three Buon, Ant. Rizzo, Pietro Lombardo, and Scarpagnino. The Giants' Staircase takes its name from the colossal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Mars and Neptune by <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a>. The halls contain <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Tintoretto, <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Paolo Veronese</a>, Palma Giovane, <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14723a.htm">Tiepolo</a>, Andrea Vicentino, Gabriele Caliari. The doge's private apartments now house the Archaeological Museum. The Marciana Library (Library of St. Mark) is in the old Mint, while the Libreria Vecchia, the work of <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a> and the most magnificent non-religious edifice in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, is now the Royal Palace. The Academy of the Fine Arts, in the guild of S. Maria della Carit&agrave;, contains pictures almost exclusively of the Venetian School. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the arsenal gave employment to 16,000 labourers, where that are now 3000; the annexed museum of nautical objects and arms contains the model of the Bucentaur, the ship on which the doge annually, on the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">feast of the Ascension</a>, celebrated the nuptials of the sea, casting a ring into it. The Art Exposition Palace, founded in 1895, is used for the international art exposition which takes place every other year. The International Gallery of Modern Art was opened in 1905 in the <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> Palace. Since 1880 there has been established in the Fondaco de' Turchi the Civic Museum, containing pictures, antique <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, warlike trophies, portraits and busts, medals, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, specimens of Venetian industries, costumes etc. One portion of this exhibition is housed in the Correr Palace. Among the most important bridges are the Rialto and the Bridge of Sighs. The finest private palaces are along the Grand Canal. Of the public monuments we shall note only the equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <em>Condottiere</em> Bartolommeo Colleoni, modelled by Verrocchio and cast by Al. Leopardi.

<p>The principal industries are ship-building, silk-spinning, galloons and laces, glass (Murano), objects of art. The sea baths of the Lido are the most elegant in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, there are two lyceum-gymnasia, a national boarding-school, a technical institute, a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls, a fine-arts institute, a nautical institute, technical and commercial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of marine engineering, etc.; also a municipal and a military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, special <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for phthisis, two lunatic asylums, two <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, two observatories, six theatres. The exports in 1905 amounted to 2,576,000,000 tons (<em>tonnelate</em>).
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The beginnings of Venice go back to the flight of the inhabitants of the Venetian state to the islands of the lagoon between Chioggia and Grado, when, in 452, <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a> devastated Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Nevertheless it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that these islands had already been inhabited in Roman times. The fugitives from the mainland in the fifth century greatly augmented the population. About 520 <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> represents the inhabitants of the islands as governed by tribunes, inhabiting pile-structures, occupied with fishing and in the navigation of distant seas; salt was their medium of exchange. The Lombard invasion resulted in a further increase of this lagoon population; it remained under the rule of Byzantium, which had the sagacity to allow a great measure of autonomy to the tribunes. The latter probably resided in the cities. In 697 a doge (<em>dux</em>) was elected for the whole lagoon, to put an end to the conflicts between various tribunes and provide a more efficacious defence against the Lombards and the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. The first doge was Anafestus Paulucius, a noble of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>, then the capital of the state. The military command was vested in a <em>magister militum</em>. The third doge, Ursus I (726-37), at the request of <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> delivered <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, which had fallen into the hands of the Lombards (735); he, however, was killed (737) in a popular tumult. For five years the state authority was entrusted to the <em>magister militum</em>, instead of doges; but that functionary held office for only one year, with the title of hypatos, or consul. In 742 the office of doge was restored and entrusted to Deusdedit, son of Ursus I, who transferred the capital to Malamocco. He was slain (755) by a certain Galla, who, after a dogeship of fourteen months, was slain in his turn. Dominicus Monegarius (756-64) became doge, two tribunes, however, being associated with him. He was expelled by the Byzantine party, and Maurizio Galbaio (764-87) was elected. For security against the Lombards and <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, Galbaio leaned on Byzantium, and obtained that his son Giovanni should be associated with him in office and have the right of succession. Giovanni (787-805) also had an associate in his son Maurizio. By reason of the slaying (803) of Joannes, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado, his nephew and successor, Fortunatus, organized a conspiracy; the doges were driven out and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> party brought about the election of Oberlierus (805-10). In the ninth century the commerce of the Venetians was very extensive. Their flag was respected even by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and their factories sprang up in all the ports of the East. From that time they traded with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, and sold to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Africa. Popes Zacharias and Adrian tried to prevent this, while for some time <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> excluded them from the markets of the Empire.

<p>In 775 took place an event which may be called the foundation of the State of Venice, the establishment of an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> on the little island of Olivolo, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of which extended over the islands of Luprio, Dorosoduro, and Rialto, taken from the Diocese of Malamocco. These islands thus formed a new polity. With the conquests of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Istria, the Venetian islands were threatened on all sides. Obelierius pursued a policy of alliance with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and helped them to gain possession of the maritime cities of Istria; but a Byzantine fleet aided the Byzantine party to expel Obelierius, and Angelo I Participazzo was made doge (810). Pipin, son of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, then attempted the conquest of the Lagoon; Brandolo and Malamocco fell into his hands, but the Venetians made head against him on Rialto. Protracted negotiations followed between <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Byzantium. The Venetian Lagoon remained under the Byzantine sway, and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> granted the Venetians freedom of commerce throughout the Empire. From this period the doge's seat was the island of Rialto; the city, formed by the combination of the surrounding islands, including Olivolo, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, began to call itself Venetiae. Then followed the reign of Participazzo (864-81) and of his sons Giustiniano (829) and Giovanni (deposed, 836). Doges Pietro Tradonico (836-64) and Orso Participazzo (864-81) fought victoriously against the Croats and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. Giovanni Participazzo (881-88), son of Orso, was deposed for his Francophilism. Pietro (888-911) defended the state against the Hungarians (906). After Orso Praticipazzo II (912-32) there began, with Pietro Candiano (932-39), the policy of expansion on the mainland; <a href="../cathen/04151a.htm">Comacchio</a>, at the mouths of the Po, and Capo d'Istria. Then followed Pietro Badoario (932-42) and Pietro Candiano III, who was forced to abdicate in favour of his son Pietro Candiano IV (959-76).

<p>Under the latter we meet for the first time with the Grand Council, the assent of which was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; besides the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, it also included the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Venetian States. The new Government prohibited the sale to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> of slaves and of any merchandise which could be used in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. But in 976 the doge's palace was set on fire, and he himself killed as he attempted to escape. His partisans, supported by the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, drove out (978) his successor, Pietro Orscolo I, who became a disciple of St. Romuald. Under Memmo, the next doge, certain rebels attempted to place Venice under the sway of <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, but the republic defended itself, and in 983 peace was restored. Memmo was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (992). Under Pietro Orscolo II (992-1009) the prestige of the republic revived. The Latin cities of the Istrian and Dalmatian coasts, incessantly menaced by the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> acknowledged the dominion of Venice, and from that time the doge, with the consent of the Emperor of Constantinople, was styled Duke of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. He gained a splendid victory over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> at <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> (1003). His son Ottone (1009-26) was suspected of wishing to bring the state under Western imperial domination, and died a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Constantinople. He was succeeded by the weak Pietro Barvolano (1030), under whom Peter, King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, son of the Doge Ottone, tried to get possession of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. After grievous internal conflicts, Flavanico became doge in 1033 and enacted wise <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against hereditary dogeship. Domenico Contareno (1043-71) was fortunate in the defence of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> against the Hungarians. At this time the office of <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of St. Mark was instituted, instead of that of state treasurer, making a clear separation between the personal patrimony of the doge and the state revenues. Domenico Silvio married a daughter of the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Ducas, and, at the request of Alexius Comnenus, made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> at sea against the Normans; he was fortunate at first, but was defeated at <a href="../cathen/04362a.htm">Corfu</a> in 1084, with the lost of nine large ships and 13,000 men, which lead to his deposition. Vitale Faledro (1084-96) retrieved the loss with the victory of Botrinto. Alexius Comnenus, by the famous Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (1084), granted the Venetians freedom from tributes and imposts, a full liberty of commerce, exemption from Greek <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, an appropriation for the Church of St. Mark, and an income for the doge, with the title of Protosebastos. From this time Venice is an independent state.

<p>The Doge Vitale Michiel (1096-1112) participated in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> only when he saw the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> bringing back booty from Palestine; and, in general, the Venetians turned the succeeding <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> to their own advantage. Alexius Comnenus, perceiving this, refused, the bull of investiture to Domenico Michiel (1117-29) and had the Venetian ships sequestrated. The Venetians, however, defeated by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> near Jaffa (1123), turned against the Greeks, and from that time even the nominal sovereignty of Constantinople was at an end. It was especially by their aid that, in 1124, <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> was taken, one-third of the city being assigned to them. In 1771 another expedition against Manual Comnenus was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; it had small success, however, on account of the plague, and the Doge Vitale Michiel II (1156-72) fell a victim to the fury of the populace. Another reform in the government was then introduced, increasing the powers of the Grand Council at the doge's expense. At the same period Venice joined the Lombardic League, without, however, showing any excessive <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for a cause which mattered but little to her, and thus the Peace of 1177, between <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederic Barbarossa</a>, was solemnized at Venice, as being a neutral city. With the <a href="../cathen/04619a.htm">Doge Enrico Dandolo</a> (1192-1205) began the most glorious period of the republic. Assuming command of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> army, he used it to reduce to obedience Trieste and <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a>, which had placed themselves under the sway of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and then turned against Constantinople, where the Latin Empire had been set up. Venice obtained three quarters in the capital, most of the Peloponnesus, the eastern shoes of the Adriatic, the Sea of Marmora, and the Black Sea, the coasts of Terraglia. &AElig;gina, <a href="../cathen/04362a.htm">Corfu</a>, and other islands of the Archipelago, and the rule over about 8,000,000 of new subjects. In these vast dominions the doge found compensation for his diminished power, as the appointment of <em>podesta</em> and other magistrates belonged to him, and thereby he could always win the friendship of those who entertained ambitions. These conquests before long became veritable fiefs of the principal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, which thus had an interest in preserving and increasing them without calling upon the State for any help to that end. The Government even purchased the island of Crete from the Marquis of Monferrato. Venice had now become the greatest power in the Mediterranean, and this stirred up the rivalry of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, which republic, in 1257 and 1258, suffered two naval defeats. <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> then formed an alliance with Michael Palaeologus, who recovered Constantinople, and Venice, her possessions threatened, engaged in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with her rival (1262-79), in which the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> were, on the whole, worsted. In 1292 the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> recommenced with greater ferocity. The <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> were victorious at Laiazzo on the Black Sea (1294); the Venetians at Galata (1296). In 1297 the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> under Spinola wasted the coasts of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. In 1298 the Venetian fleet was destroyed by Lamba d'Oria, a victory which brought about the Peace of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1299). Venice now needed consolidation. The Venetians had meanwhile become interested in Italian affairs.

<p>In the thirteenth century the election of the doge was reserved to the Greater Council, composed of 480 members taken from certain <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The doge could do nothing without his councillors the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the office were restated afresh for every new doge, and he must swear to observe them. Affairs of greater moment were discussed by councillors, who invited a certain number of members of the Council (<em>pregadi</em>) of whom the Senate was afterwards constituted. In 1297 it was enacted that only those who had sat in the Greater Council and their descendants should be eligible; thus was formed an aristocracy which monopolized the offices of State. The conspiracy of Boemondo Tiepolo (1310), for the restoration of democratic government, was repressed by the Doge Gradenigo (1289-1310); the Council of Ten was instituted to guard the existing constitution, and the most important matters were afterwards reserved to it. At first provisional, it became permanent in 1335; the individual members, however, held office for only one year. In 1454 the three inquisitors of State were instituted for cases of high policy; it was thanks to this institution that Venice remained a republic, and no one succeeded in becoming its <em>Signore</em>. Besides, until 1506 there was no juridical distinction between nobles and plebeians. In the fourteenth century Venice began to extend her dominion on the mainland, joining the league against Mastino della Scala, from whom it took Treviso (1338), Castelfranco, and <a href="../cathen/03519b.htm">Ceneda</a>. The possession of Crete had to be defended by force of arms in 1307 and 1365.

<p>About the same time (1334 and 1342) alliances were formed with the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> and the Knights of Rhodes against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who were beginning to render navigation unsafe. The <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> having taken the island of Sico and interfered with Venetian navigation in the Black Sea, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> again broke out in 1350. There was fighting on the Bosporus (1352) and off the coasts of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> (1353), where the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> were beaten; and then peace was restored, Venice having to abandon all her ports in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>.

<p>In 1355 the Doge Marion Falieri was beheaded, charged with having conspired to overturn the Government and make himself Lord of Venice. This incident occasioned new limitations to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the doge. Next followed the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> for the possession of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, in which all its neighbours took sides against the republic, and Venice lost the greater part of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> (1358). The possession of the island of <a href="../cathen/14506b.htm">Tenedos</a> was the cause of a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, assisted by other foes of Venice. The Venetians, victors at Anzio (1378), were defeated at Pola (1379). Checked by the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> at sea and by Francesco Carrara, Lord of Padua, on land, Venice would then have made peace, had not the conditions been exorbitant. A new armament was prepared, with which Vettor Pisani blockaded the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> fleet at <a href="../cathen/03689a.htm">Chioggia</a>, forcing it to surrender (1380). By the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, however, Venice had to cede all <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Trieste to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, Treviso to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Tenedos to Byzantium. But the loss was soon recovered. The <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> were defeated near Modono in 1403; in 1406 Padua and all the possessions of Francesco Carrara were taken and the prince and his sons strangled in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Then the Emperor Sigismund seized the Dalmatian coast, while <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> and all the Scala possessions were annexed between 1403 and 1405 by Venice, which not long after took Friuli, Udive, Feltre, and Belluno from the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. In the meantime the Venetian possessions had been growing in the Morea and Albania (1390-1400), and the republic was co-operating with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottomans</a>.

<p>In 1423 the republic joined the league of Freancesco Gonzaga, Nicolo d'Este, and Florence against Filippo Maria Visconti. Venetian troops routed the Visconti forces at Maclodio (1427), and Filippo Maria ceded Bergamo and Bresci to Venice. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> being renewed, the Venetian squadron defeated the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> allies of the Visconti at Portofino (1431). When peace was made, Venice retained her acquisitions. In 1437 she again allied herself with Florence against the Visconti, and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> lasted until 1441, when she had taken <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> from the Polenta. When Francesco Sforza became Duke of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Venice united with the King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> against him, to increase her territory on the mainland; but <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> brought about the Peace of <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a> (1454), which was designed to ensure Italian equilibrium. So soon was Venice again embroiled with Florence that it seemed as though she aimed at dominating the whole peninsula, but she was forced to keep still (1468). In 1480 a pretext was made to serve for a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Then all the Italian states united against the republic, and even <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, after the Venetian victory of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a> (1482), withdrew from his alliance with Venice. Still, from this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, too, Venice carried off an augmentation of her Italian territory. At the same time, however, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> took from Venice the greater part of the &AElig;gean Islands, as well as Negropont and all her possessions in the Morea, and pushed their conquests as far as Friuli, threatening the republic's Italian possessions. In 1479 Venice had to renounce all claims to the territory taken from her by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Not less disastrous was the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> from 1498 to 1503. These losses were to some degree compensated by the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, ceded in 1489 by Caterina Cornaro, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of the last king, and <a href="../cathen/15750a.htm">Zante and Cephalonia</a>. But another great blow for Venice was the discovery of the maritime route to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1498. To the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> two Venetians, Giovanni Caboto and his son Sebastiano, contributed; with English vessels they discovered Newfoundland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia. Still more famous are the travels of the Venetian <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a> in the interior of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, extending as far as <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, in the thirteenth century.

<p>After the accession of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> and the fall of Cesare Borgia, the Venetians invaded the Romagna. <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> then formed the League of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, which, besides the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the princes of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, included the emperor, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at that time mistress of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1508). At first it seemed that the last hour of Venice had come; in Apulia the Spanish took the coast towns which Venice had occupied during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for the possession of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; at Agnadello the French defeated the bulk of the Venetian army, and <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, and Peschiera were occupied by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1509); the Venetians were driven out of Romagna, while other portions of their territory were seized by the Bonzaga and the Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Maximilian had the imperial standard raised at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, and Padua. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, having accomplished their purpose, withdrew from the league, and the emperor was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recross the Alps the same year. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> formed another league, the Holy League (1511), against the French and their Italian allies, especially the Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. On the death of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, Venice formed an alliance (League of Blois, 1513) with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for mutual assistance against the emperor, or against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, or for the reconquest of the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and Imperialists, having defeated the French, occupied all the Venetian possessions on the mainland. The unexpected arrival of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1515) made it possible, however, for Venice to recover everything. Again in 1521 and 1525 Venice was the ally of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> against <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, without suffering by the victories of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> meanwhile went on gaining victories; Venice joined the league of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that she had been betrayed at the battle of Prevesa (1538), concluded an unfavourable peace with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, paying them a tribute for the islands which she still retained. In 1569 the Sultan Selim II set about the conquest of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, which was heroically defended; the city of Famagosta was the last to surrender (18 August, 1571). Meanwhile an alliance had been formed with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the allied fleet defeated the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> at <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a> (October, 1571). Venice, however, making peace on her own account, surrendered her claims to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. The republic was beginning to decline politically and commercially. The habits and customs of the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> nobility had been introduced among the Venetian nobles, and thus an aristocracy had been formed without wealth, and which it was not longer possible to provide with offices in foreign possessions. This ruined nobility, with a keen <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> for luxury and pleasures, was a constant element of political disturbance and of foreign intrigue.

<p>A serious difficulty with <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> arose out of the trial of certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by lay tribunals, contrary to the provisions which had then recently been made. Gaining nothing by an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> prepared for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; but the intervention of Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> effected a reconciliation (1606-07). The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> sought to profit by this occasion to pervert the population of Venice. Venice, indeed, had always granted a wide liberty to the various creeds, though she would not permit her own subjects to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>. Forced by the Italian princes to combat the Uscochs Uskoken (Croatian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had escaped from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and become pirates), she made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the empire at Friuli. In the Valtellina controversy Venice was allied with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Grisons, out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1644 a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> fleet attacked Canea, a city of Crete which Venice had kept in her possession by the expenditure of blood and treasure. Canea fell before the arrival of the Venetian fleet aided by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Knights of Malta and of St. Stephen. This <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> lasted until 1669, when Candia fell, after a siege of twenty-four years, attacked by sea, by land, and underground. The victories over the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> near Phoc&aelig;a (1649), in the Cyclades (1651), and near the Dardanelles (1652, 1656 and 1657), could only retard the issue of this unequal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Francesco Morosini capitulated, and was allowed to depart with all the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. In 1695 he resumed command and conquered all the Morea as far as Corinth. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ended with the Peace of Carlowitz (1699), which secured to Venice the Morea and the Ionian Isles free of tribute. In 1714 the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> returned to the attack, and, with the Peace of Passarowitz (1718), Venice lost all her conquests in the Balkan Peninsula except a few towns in Albania.

<p>The period of peace which followed was favourable to literature and the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, but luxury and licence increased; the philosophy of the Encyclopaedists, together with indifference to religion, had sown the seed of revolutionary doctrines. The nobles of the mainland, in particular, were becoming restless, desiring a share in the government, which had been accessible only to Venetians. The last warlike action of the republic was the expedition of Angelo Emo against the Barbary States (1784-86). The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1796 soon passed from <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> to Venetian territory, the republic being unable to defend its neutrality. When the Veronese rose against their French garrison (17-21 April, 1797), <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> used the pretext to arrest the inquisitors of State and to change the Venetian Government from aristocratic to democratic. To effect this change, French troops entered the city, seized all the ships, the treasury, and a great many works of art. Soon after this, by the Treaty of Campoformio, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> gave Venice, with its territory on the mainland, to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Thus ended the republic. In 1805 <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> abandoned all Italian possessions, and thus Venice was united to the Napoleonic <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. In 1814 the viceroy Eugene, to save <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, retroceded Venetia to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The news of the Revolution of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> Insurrection, in 1848, found a ready echo in Venice, where the Austrian garrison, the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> excepted, departed after peacefully capitulating. Daniele Manin was at the head of the provisional government, which the cities of the mainland accepted; they soon after joined the union with <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> under Carlo Alberto, as had already been done by Venice, and in a few days news arrived of the cessation of hostilities between <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The Venetian republic was then re-established (11 August, 1848). The <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> general Guglielmo Pepe commanded the Venetian troops against the Austrians who came to retake the city. It was besieged in October; on 24 August, 1849, after a bombardment of twenty-four days, it surrendered. In 1866 <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> ceded Venice to <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>, who gave it to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>.
<h2>Commercial history</h2>

<p>The city itself was chiefly occupied in the importation from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the Levant, and the Black Sea, of the greatest variety of raw products, such as hides, minerals, salt, wax, sugar, borax, wool, silk, spices, drugs, guns, <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, ostrich feathers, parrots, gold dust, etc. The Venetians also exploited the iron and copper mines of Friuli, Cadore, and Carmizia. From <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and their own possessions on the mainland came their exportations of woollen, silk, and linen fabrics. The manufacturers of the Venetian dominions might not export directly; everything must pass through the capital. They maintained important relations with the city of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, from which the products were distributed through the North. On the other hand, the silver of the Tyrolean mines was brought to Venice. The special industries of Venice were the manufacture of chemicals-- cream of tartar, cinnabar (vermilion), shellac, white lead, and <em>triaca</em> (the "universal medicine"), sugar-refining, tanning, the preparation of furs imported from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the manufacture of imitation pearls and gems, and goldsmith's work. The industries had their guilds, with <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of their own in various churches. It was in Venice that banks of deposit and circulation originated, and Venice was the first state to raise a public loan (1156, the <em>monte vecchio</em>; the <em>monte nuovo</em> was issued in 1580; the <em>nuovissimo</em>, in 1610). Banking law had its origin in Venice. As early as 1253 marine insurance was made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The Doge Renier Zeno (1253-68) had a code of navigation and commerce compiled. One important branch of commerce was the supply of the African <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> princes with tools and timber for building, a practice forbidden under <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> because it tended to the perpetuation of piracy. Printing was an important industry. Venice was also a thriving centre of the slave trade.
<h2>Art</h2>

<p>In Venice art found an exceptionally favourable field. The traditions of centuries, however, and relations with the East retarded the influence of that new art impulse which had reached other Italian cities in the thirteenth century. In <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, especially, Venetian artists in the fourteenth century were still trammelled by the Byzantine tradition. The first art to become emancipated was architecture, architects and workmen from the mainland being employed. It appears that the Romanesque style, no less than the Gothic, in Venice felt the influence of the environment. When, with its conquests on the mainland, the republic had become an Italian power; it soon became one of the principal centres of art; its immense wealth, both public and private, afforded opportunity to the choicest geniuses for the creation of the works already mentioned in this article. It is to be noted, however, that few of the famous artists of the so-called Venetian School were really Venetians. They were mostly natives of the Venetian provinces, and therefore Lombards. First to inaugurate the revival, or <em>rinascimento</em>, in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was the Paduan Guardiento (1365), a pupil of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. Next the three Muranesi, Antonio, Giovanni, and Andrea, were eminent, influenced by the German and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15491b.htm">Vivarini</a>, Bartolommeo (1450-99) and Luigi (1461-1503). These, as well as Jacobello del Fiore, <a href="../cathen/04509a.htm">Carlo Crivelli</a>, Fra Francesco da Negroponte, and also Jacopo and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> Bellini, exhibit, as compared with the contemporary Lombards, an art still in the archaic stage. With Giovanni Bellini Venetian art attains perfection, while at the same time displaying its own special prerogative, mastery of colouring. To this School belong the following Venetians: <a href="../cathen/03772a.htm">G.B. Cima (da Conegliano)</a>; <a href="../cathen/03373c.htm">Vittore Carpaccio</a>; <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgio Barbarelli (Giorgione)</a>, from whom his fellow student, <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Tiziano Veceili (Titian)</a>, learned much; <a href="../cathen/12104b.htm">Sebastiano del Piombo</a>, who carried to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the art of colour; the two Palma, the elder of whom (<a href="../cathen/11430a.htm">Palma Vecchio</a>) has various styles at his command; Jacopo Robusti (Tintoretto), the master of lights and shadows of whom <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> was jealous, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to combine beauty and <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a> with <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian's</a> power and naturalness; <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Paolo Veronese</a>, the exponent of the Venetian School. But after him the repute of Venetian <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was soon brought low by his successors. Only with <a href="../cathen/14723a.htm">Giovanni Battista Tiepolo</a>, a pupil of G. B. Piazzetta, in the eighteenth century, does Venetian <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, with a still more perfect technic, celebrate a glorious resurrection. Even in the nineteenth century the Venetian <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> remained faithful to the tradition of their School; conspicuous among them, Giacomo Favretto and Giulio Ciardi. In <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> even more than in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> Venice took her artists from abroad. The most distinguished of the fifteenth century were Pietro Lombardo and his sons Tullio and Andrea. Verrocchio modelled perhaps the finest equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in the world. Also eminent were Alessandro Leopardo and his sons, and the brothers Antonio and Lorenzo Bregno, to whose credit are the finest monuments in the various churches of the city.
<h2>Ecclesiastical history</h2>

<p>The Venetian islands at first belonged to the Diocese of Altino or of Padua. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that Bishop Tricidius of Padua took refuge on the island of Malamocco. But when Tricidius returned to Padua there still remained a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Malamocco (Methamancus), and the Venetian islands remained under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> until 775. In that year, with the consent of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado, an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was erected on the island of Olivolo (afterwards called Castello) with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Gemini, Rialto, Luprio, and dorsoduro. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (nominated by the doge) was Obelerius, who was invested and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> by the doge, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the patriarch. The rest of the islands which now form Venice remained under the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado. To succeed him (798), the doge named a certain Cristoforo, whom, on account of his extreme youth, Giovanni, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado, refused to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>. Giovanni was killed, and his successor, after much hesitation, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Cristoforo. Under the fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Orso, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Mark were brought to Venice; the legend, that St. Mark himself had preached the Gospel at Venice, grew up in later times. As many bodies of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> had already been brought from the East, so, following the conquest of Constantinople, a still greater number now came to Venice, besides the Madonna called Nicopoeia, which is still in St. Mark's. Marco II Michel (1225) finally secured the exemption of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from lay <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, except in cases involving real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Jacopo Albertini (1311) became attached to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, whom he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with the Iron Crown (1327), and was therefore deposed. Under Nicolo' Morosini (1336) the dispute between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and Government concerning the mortuary <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> was settled, though it began afresh under Paolo Foscari (1367) and was ended only in 1376.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Schism of the West</a>, Venice always adhered to the Roman obedience. In 1457, upon the death of Domenico Michel, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> suppressed the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and the Bishopric of Csastello, incorporating them both in the new Patriarchate of Venice (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Regis aeterni"), thus Venice succeeded to the whole <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Grado, including the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. The election of the patriarch belonged to the Senate, and this practice sometimes led to differences between the republic and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In like manner parishoners elected their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, by the right of patronage. Girolamo Quirini, O.P. (1519-54), had many disputes with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, with the Government, and with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; to avoid these disputes, the Senate decreed that in future no one but a senator should be eligible. Those elected after this were frequently <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Giovanni Trevisano, O.S.B. (1560), introduced the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reforms, founding the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, holding <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and collecting the regulations made by his predecessors (Constitutiones et privilegia patriarchatus et cleri Venetiarum). In 1581 the <em>visita Apostolica</em> was sent to Venice; a <em>libellus exhortatorius</em> was published, in which the <em>visita</em> highly praises the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Venice.

<p>In 1807, by favour of the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> Nicola Gambroni was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and of his own authority transferred the patriarchal seat to the Basilica of St. Mark, uniting the two chapters; he reduced the number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches from seventy to thirty. The work of enlarging the choir of the basilica brought to light the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Mark (1808). In 1811 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> intruded into the See of Venice Stefano Bonsignore, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, but in 1814 that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> returned to his own see. In 1818 the Dioceses of Torcello and Carole were merged in that of Venice, while the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the Venetian territory were placed under its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Cardinal Giuseppe Sarto, afterwards <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, succeeded in 1893; he was refused recognition by the Italian Government, which claimed the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> formerly employed by the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and in earlier times by the Venetian Senate, but after eleven months this pretension was abandoned.

<p>The suffragans of Venice are <a href="../cathen/01155a.htm">Adria</a>, Belluno and Feltre, <a href="../cathen/03519b.htm">Ceneda</a>, <a href="../cathen/03689a.htm">Chioggia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>, <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 45 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (32 in the city), about 160 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, etc; 250 secular and 280 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 12 houses of male and 32 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> religious; 150,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; 5 institutes for boys and 15 for girls. It has one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily (La Difesa) and two weeklies.
