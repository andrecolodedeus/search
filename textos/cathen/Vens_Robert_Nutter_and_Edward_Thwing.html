<h1>Vens. Robert Nutter and Edward Thwing</h1>  

<h2 id="nutter">Ven. Robert Nutter</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyr</a>; b. at Burnley, Lancashire, c. 1550; executed at Lancaster, 26 July, 1600. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford in 1564 or 1565, and, with his brother John, also a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (see <a href="../cathen/07159a.htm">G<font size=-2>EORGE</font> H<font size=-2>AYDOCK</font></a>, became a student of the English College, <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 21 Dec., 1581, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. On 2 Feb., 1583-4 he was committed to the Tower, where he remained in the pit forty-seven days, wearing irons for forty-three days, and twice subjected to the tortures of "the scavenger's daughter". On 10 November, 1584, he was again consigned to the pit, where he remained until, on 21 Jan., 1584-5, he, with twenty other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and one <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, was shipped aboard the "Mary Martin" of Colchester, at Tower Wharf. Landing at <a href="../cathen/02714b.htm">Boulogne</a>, 2 Feb., he revisited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in July, but, on 30 November, was again committed to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, this time to Newgate, under the <em>alias</em> of Rowley. In 1587 he was removed to the Marshalsea, and thence, in 1589-90, was sent to Wisbech Castle, Cambridgeshire. There, in 1597, he signed a petition to Father Garnet in favour of having a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> superior, but, on 8 Nov., 1598, he and his fellow <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Venerable Edward Thwing, with others, besought the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to institute an <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>.

<h2 id="thwing">Ven. Edward Thwing</h2>

<p>V<font size=-2>ENERABLE</font> E<font size=-2>DWARD</font> T<font size=-2>HWING</font> was the second son of Thomas Thwing, of Heworth, near <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and Jane (n&eacute;e Kellet, of York), his wife. He was at the English College, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 12 July to 12 August, 1583; and 20 July, 1585, to 2 Sept., 1587, having spent the interval with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Pont-&#224;-Mousson. On 2 Sept., 1587 he set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, returning to become a reader in Greek and Hebrew, and a professor of rhetoric and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Laon in the following December. On 4 Nov., 1592, he went to Spa suffering from ulcer in the knee. He returned to the English College, which had in the meantime been transferred from <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and went on the mission in 1597. He seems to have been immediately arrested and sent to Wisbech, whence he and Nutter escaped to Lancashire, were arrested, May, 1600, tried at the next assizes and condemned for being <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Both suffered on the same day.
