<h1>Vera Cruz</h1>  

<p>(VERAE CRUCIS or JALAPENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican Republic</a>, suffragan of the Archbishopric of Mexico. Its area covers all the State of Vera Cruz with the exception of one or two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the northern part which belong to <a href="../cathen/14440c.htm">Tamaulipas</a>, one in the western part which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15086a.htm">Diocese of Tulancingo</a> and a few others in the southern part which are a part of the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/14473a.htm">Tehuantepec</a>. Its population amounts to 1,124,368. The capital of the State, which is the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is Jalapa, 4335 feet above the level of the sea, and has a population of 24,816 inhabitants. (Census of 1910). When <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hernando Cort&eacute;s</a> landed at what is now the seaport of Vera Cruz on 2 April, 1519 (<a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, whence the town obtained its name) he was accompanied by Father Fray Bartolome de Olmedo, who was intrusted with the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of the new colony founded by this audacious leader. With them was the licenciado, Juan Diaz, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, Geronimo Aguilar, who, having been kept a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the Indians for a few years, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their language and acted as interpreter for the expedition. From a letter written by <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hernando Cort&eacute;s</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, it is known that on 15 Oct., 1524, there were <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with their rectors, <a href="../cathen/13748a.htm">sextons</a>, and ornaments, in Vera Cruz.

<p>During the first century of the existence of the colony, Vera Cruz was considered of such importance, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had made such headway, that the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was thought advisable. In consequence, the viceroy, Martin Enriquez, brought over a royal decree in which the name of Father Fray Domingo Tineo Dominico was presented for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>; but when the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> was received in 1567, a year had already elapsed since the candidate had died at Puebla. While passing through Vera Cruz, Bishop Luis de Penalver of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, who had been promoted to the Metropolitan See of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, was asked by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Board of Vera Cruz to visit the coast of Sotavento which had not been visited by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for a period of forty years; Bishop Penalver complied with this request and in his report showed the necessity of establishing a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in that country with Vera Cruz in its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. This request was granted in 1804 but was never fulfilled. Futile attempts were also made in 1835 and 1845; finally, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in a secret consistory on 19 March, 1863, named Francisco Francisco Su&aacute;rez Peredo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vera Cruz, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> established his residence in Jalapa, the city in which his successor still resides. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were taken from the Bishopric of Puebla and <a href="../cathen/11180a.htm">Oaxaca</a>; since its establishment it has always been suffragan of the Archbishopric of Mexico. It has a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with a few alumni; 57 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and 11 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges which have about 5205 students; it has 61 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 3 permanent vicariates. There are 3 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> colleges with 113 students and 5 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The most important city of the Diocese is Vera Cruz, the principal seaport of the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Republic of Mexico</a>, situated not far from the town founded by <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a>. Only a few ruins are left today to attest the good work inspired by the faithful of the times, where stood a great many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at the time of the colony. It was there that the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers, the Barefooted <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and other orders made their residences.
