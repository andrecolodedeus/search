<h1>Vercelli</h1>  

<p>(VERCELLENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in the Province of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city of Vercelli is an important commercial centre for agricultural produce. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, erected and enlarged by <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius</a>, formerly adorned with precious pillars and <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, was remodelled in the ninth century, and radically changed in the sixteenth by <a href="../cathen/01308a.htm">Count Alfieri</a>. Like the other churches in the city it contains valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, especially those of <a href="../cathen/06047a.htm">Gaudenzio Ferrari</a>, Giovenone, and Lanino, who were natives of Vercelli. Noteworthy also are Sta. Maria Maggiore and Sant' Andrea. The latter was erected by Cardinal Guala Bicchieri (1219) together with the old <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, one of the most beautiful and best preserved Romanesque monuments in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. There is an Institute of the Beaux-Arts, containing <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Vercellese artists. There are many relics of the Roman period, e.g. an amphitheatre, hippodrome, sarcophagi, many important inscriptions, some of which are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. There are old <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> founded by Cardinal Guala Bicchieri (11224), which has an annual revenue of more than 600,000 <em>lire</em> ($117,000); the hospices for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls (1553), and for boys (1542), and <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a> homes. The archives of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter contain valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, including an evangelarium of the fourth century, the "Novels" of Justinian, the "Leges Langobardorum", the "Capitulare regum Francorum", also hagiographical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> not all of which have been critically examined, and a very old copy of the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a>, which is relied upon as an argument for attributing the authorship of the work to John Gersen. The civil archives are not less important, and contain documents <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 882. The extensive <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> contains a large <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>.

<p>Vercellae (<em>Vercelum</em>) was a city of the Libici, or Lebecili, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Ligurian tribe; it became an important <em>municipium</em>, near which in 101 B.C. Marius defeated the Cimbri and the Teutones, and Stilicho annihilated the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> 500 years later. It was half ruined in <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> time. After the Lombard invasion it belonged to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>. From 885 it was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was a count of the empire. It became an independent commune in 11120, and joined the first and second Lombard leagues. Its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> are among the most interesting of those of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> republics. In 1197 they abolished the servitude of the <a href="../cathen/06582a.htm">glebe</a>. In 1228 the <a href="../cathen/11593a.htm">University of Pavia</a> was transferred to Vercelli, where it remained till the fourteenth century, but without gaining much prominence. Only a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of law has been maintained. During the troubles of the thirteenth century it fell into the power of the Della Torre of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1263), of the Marquesses of Monferrato (1277), who appointed Matteo Visconti captain (1290-9). The <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a> (Tizzoni) and <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> (Avogadri) disputed the city from 1301 to 1334, the latter party being expelled several times, thus enabling the Marquess of Monferrato to take Vercelli (1328), which <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> placed itself under the Viscount of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1334. In 1373 Bishop Giovanni Fieschi expelled the Visconti, but Matteo reconquered the city. Facino Cane (1402), profiting by the strife between Giovani Maria and Filippo Maria Visconti, took Vercelli, but was driven out by Teodoro di Monferrato (1404), from whom the city passed to the dukes of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> (1427). In 1499 and 1553 it was captured by the French, and in 1616 and 1678 by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. In 1704 it sustained an energetic siege by the French, who failed to destroy the fortress; after this it shared the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. In 1821 Vercelli rose in favour of the Constitution.

<p>According to an ancient lectionary the Gospel was first preached here in the second half of the third century by Sts. Sabinianus and Martialis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from Gaul, when they were returning to their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was not established till after the Peace of Constantine. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and a strenuous opponent of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. From Vercelli the Gospel spread through the valley of the Po and its environs; towards the end of the fourth century, perhaps even during the episcopate of <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius</a>, new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were erected. From <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Eusebius</a> to Nottingo (830) there were forty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose images were preserved in the Eusebian basilica, so called because <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius</a> dedicated it to St. Theonestus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in it. He introduced the common and monastic life among his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, from whom <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the surrounding territory were often selected. Among his successors were: St. Simenus (370), who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>; <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a> (396), who administered the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a> to St. Ambrose; St. Justinianus (living in 451); St. &AElig;milianus (about 500) built an aqueduct for the city at his own expense; St. Flavianus (541); St. Celsus (665); Norgaudus (844) restored common life among the canons; Liutuardus (880), who had been archchancellor of Charles the Fat (deposed later); and who was slain during the invasion of the Huns (899), like Regenbertus (904-24); Atto (d. 960), reformer of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>; Petrus (978), <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Holy Land by the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>; Leo (999), chancellor of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> and Henry II; Gisulfus (1133) re-established common life among the canons in 1144; St. Albertus (1185-1204), founder of the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, later <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; Renerio Avogadro (1296) opposed the partisans of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Fra Dolcino; Guglielmo Didier (1437), an elector of <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>; Giuliano della Rovere (1502), later <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> (1503); Cardinal Guido Ferrerio (1562), founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, embellished the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and introduced the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reform; Gianfrancesco Bonomo (1572) continued the reform and replaced (1573) the Eusebian Rite by the Roman. In 1817 the Diocese of Vercelli, then suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> (but previously of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>) was made an archdiocese, the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> being Giuseppe di Grimaldi. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> suffragan to Vercelli are: Alessandri, <a href="../cathen/02559b.htm">Biella</a>, <a href="../cathen/03396a.htm">Casale</a>, <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, Vigevano. The archdiocese contains 136 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 250,000 inhabitants; 447 secular and 33 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 7 houses of religious (men) and 4 of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 4 <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institutes for boys and 8 for girls. The religious periodicals are "L'unione" (weekly) and "La santa infanzia" (monthly).
