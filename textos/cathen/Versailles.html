<h1>Versailles</h1>  

<p>(VERSALIENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; includes the Department of Seine-et-Oise, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Created in 1790 by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was maintained by the Concordat of 1802; it included also the Department of Eure-et-Loir, detached from it in 1822 by the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Diocese of Chartres</a>. It was made up of considerable parts of the ancient Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, and some cantons belonging formerly to the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, Senlis, and <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a>. At the beginning of the seventeenth century Versailles was a mere village, whose <em>seigneur</em> was Antoinede Lom&eacute;nie. Louis XIII bought it in 1632, and had a small ch&acirc;teau built there. The present ch&acirc;teau was begun under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> by <a href="../cathen/09609a.htm">Mansart</a> (1661), the gardens were designed by Len&ocirc;tre; the interior decorations were entrusted to <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> lived there in 1672 and constantly from 1682. The residence was finished in 1684, and a town soon grew up. The French monarchs resided at Versailles for more than century; here was signed (3 Sept., 1783) the treaty between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, acknowledging the independence of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; here took place (1 May, 1789) the opening of the States-General, and it was here too, in the hall of the Jeu de Paume, that the delegates of the Third Estate, and some members of the other two estates (nobility and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>), constituted themselves a national assembly. It was from Versailles that the Parisian populace took Louis XVI and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> (6 Oct., 1789), and brought them back to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The Grand Trianon was built under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> by <a href="../cathen/09609a.htm">Mansart</a>; the Petit Trianon was given by Louis XVI to <a href="../cathen/09665a.htm">Marie Antoinette</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the ch&acirc;teau was built 1699-1710; the <a href="../cathen/14624a.htm">Theophilantropists</a> worshipped there during 1794-95. "This chapel", P&eacute;rat&eacute; says, "is, in the whole and its details, one of the most perfect monuments that <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> ever built."

<p>Saint-Cyr, near Versailles, is famous for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institute that <a href="../cathen/09548b.htm">Madame de Maintenon</a> founded there for young girls. The city of St-Cloud, whose ch&acirc;teau dates from <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, owes its origin to the Monastery of Novigentum, founded by St. Clodald or Cloud, son of King Clodomir (d. About 560). At St-Cloud, Jacques Cl&eacute;ment attempted the life of Henry III. There also <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> executed against the "Assembly of the Five Hundred" the <em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em> of 18 Brumaire. Nearby is Meudon, once the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Rabelais. The town of St-Germain-en-Laye, whose present ch&acirc;teau dates from <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, owes its origin to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> founded during the eleventh century by King Robert; Louis XIII died there. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> was born there, and James II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> died there. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Morigny, near Etampes, was founded about 1102 by a nobleman called Ansaeu. He established in it <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from St-Gerner de Flaix, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Diocese of Beauvais</a>. At the beginning of the eleventh century the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and revenues of St-Martin d'Etampes, said to have been founded by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, were given to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Morigny by Philip I. On 3 Oct., 1120, <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the church of Morigny. In Jan., 1131, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> an altar to <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> there; <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> were present at this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. The Abbey of Morigny was united in 1629 to the Congregation of St-Maur, and has ceased to exist since the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In 1092, 1099, 1130 councils took place at Etampes (in the latter of which, on the advice of St. Bernard, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sided with <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Anacletus); also in 1147. At Poissy, St. Louis was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, founded at Poissy in 1304, was celebrated.

<p>The "Colloquy of Poissy" took place (1561) between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> under the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine, and Montluc, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> under Theodore Beza. It opened on 9 Sept., in the refectory of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, before Charles IX and Catharine de'Medici. A second sitting took place 16 Sept., and was followed by two conferences between the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> on both sides. The colloquy had no result. The town of Isle-Adam, in the Diocese of Versailles, belonged, since the twelfth century, to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, whose most famous member was Philipe de l'Isle-Adam (1464-1534), Grand Master of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Order of Jerusalem</a>, who in 1522 held Rhodes for six months against 200,000 <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> was situated in the commune of St-Lambert, at the hamlet of Vaumurier. Among the natives of the present territory of the Diocese of Versailles may be mentioned: Duplessis-Mornay (1549-1623), surnamed the "pope of the Huguenots", author of a treatise on "The Institution of the Eucharist", and who was defeated by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at the Conference of Fontainebleau (1600); Pierre du Moulin (1568-1658), a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, who composed for James I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> several apologetic writings, and taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Sedan; Abb&eacute; de l'Ep&eacute;e (1712-89), inventor of a method for teaching the deaf and dumb; Abb&eacute; Gu&eacute;n&eacute;e (1717-1803), born at Etampes, author (1769) of the well-known "Lettres de plusieurs Juifs Portugais etc., &agrave; M. De Voltaire"; Marquise de La Rochejacquelein (1772-1857), author of memoirs concerning the War of La Vend&eacute;e.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame de Bonne Garde, at Longpoint (ninth century); St. Bernard, <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08327b.htm">St. Jeanne de Valois</a> visited this sanctuary; Notre-Dame de Pontoise (1226) to which St. Louis, Charles V, and <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> were very generous; Notre-Dame des Anges, at Clichy l'Aunois (1212); the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of the Holy Tunic of Christ that <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who had received it from the Empress Irene gave (August, 800) to his daughter Theodrade, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Argenteuil, and that was transferred (1804) from the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, destroyed during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Argenteuil. There were in the Diocese of Versailles before the Law of Associations (1901): <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>; <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>; <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of the Immaculate Conception; <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; Missionaries of Notre-Dame of Africa; Resurrectionists; <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a> of Don Bosco; and several orders of teaching brothers. Several orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> arose in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: the Hospitaller Augustine. of Etampes, founded in 1515; the Maid-Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (<a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and teaching), founded in 1866 with mother house at Versailles; the Sisters of the Holy Childhood, with mother house at Versailles.
