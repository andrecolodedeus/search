<h1>Vespasian</h1>  

<p>(TITUS FLAVIUS VESPASIANUS).

<p>Roman Emperor, b. at Reate (now <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>), the ancient capital of the Sabines, 18 Nov., A.D. 9; d. there, 23 June, 79. His father was a prosperous tax-gatherer and moneylender, while the fact that his mother's brother was a senator may have at least encouraged him to enter the public service. Early in his career he had opportunities to become familiar with conditions in the Levant, where he served as quaestor; before entering his thirty-fourth year he had filled still more important magistracies. After serving with the army in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he made a successful expedition into Southern Britain in command of the Second Legion, and attained consular rank in A.D. 51. Ten years later he was proconsul in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. He first appears in history as a member of the imperial suite when he accompanied <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> on a tour through Greece; but Vespasian was evidently a very poor courtier, for it is said that he fell asleep in <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> presence while the emperor was reciting one of his own poems. In spite of this offensive conduct, and either because <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> could be sensible enough to forget personal animosities when reasons of state demanded, or because no one else could be found who was not still more objectionable, Vespasian was appointed to conduct the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>-an appointment which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the immediate cause of his elevation to the purple.

<p>Brutal oppression by successive Roman governors, culminating in the atrocities of Gessius Florus, had stirred the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to an insurrection in which the Roman garrison of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was slaughtered. Many considerations <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the Roman Court to take a serious view of this disturbance, not the least being the widespread <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that a new power originating in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> was destined to supplant <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the mastery of the world. Taking with him his son Titus, Vespasian, in 66, invaded <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, entering upon the last <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were to take part as a nation. The siege of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in which more than half a million of the inhabitants perished, was conducted by Titus, and ended in the fall of the city (2 Sept., 70), and the final destruction of the Temple. In the meantime <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> career had ended in <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>, his successor, Galba, had been killed by Otho, and Otho, in his turn dethroned by partisans of Vitellius, had followed <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> last example. While the Jewish <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was still in progress the soldiers in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> proclaimed Vespasian emperor (1 July, 69), and their comrades in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> confirmed the choice. Ostensibly, at least, he had made no bid for the diadem, but his soldiers were sincerely attached to him, and the debauchee Vitellius, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> parasite and favourite, whom the legions in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> had proclaimed, was as unpromising from a military point of view as he was morally worthless. Vespasian remained at his post in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, while his lieutenant, Antonius Primus, with the armies of Pannonia and the Balkan Peninsula, invaded <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, routed the Vitellian forces near <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, and stormed <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which was defended by the Praetorian Guard and the populace (20 Dec., 69). It was not until the following summer that the new emperor left the conduct of affairs in Palestine to his son Titus and entered the city to receive confirmation at the hands of the Senate.

<p>Vespasian's assumption of the imperial authority ended one of those spasms of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which had shaken <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at intervals ever since the days of Marius and Sulla. His reign was distinctly an era of reform. Titus, who was to become one of the most beneficent <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rulers in history, was associated as Caesar in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> administration. The dignity of the Roman Senate was revived, largely by elimination of the disreputable elements; the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of treason, an odious legal cloak for tyranny, was abrogated; the courts of law were reformed; military discipline was placed upon a fairly secure basis. Vespasian, who was a master of financial administration, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to lavish his wealth in adding to the splendour of the imperial city, and it was in his reign that the Colosseum was begun. Abroad, the final conquest of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> was followed by the suppression of a serious rising in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and the consolidation of Roman authority in Britain by Cneius Agricola, who built the chain of forts between the Firths of Clyde and Forth. Still more important to the subsequent progress of civilization was the period of tranquility for the infant Church which began in this reign. The official classes of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> then regarded the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> vaguely as a Jewish <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and as such the latter was subject to the impost of half a shekel for rebuilding the Capitoline temple, which had been destroyed when <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was stormed for Vespasian; but this tax does not seem to have been the occasion of any general harsh treatment. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (Apologia) and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/2501.htm"><em>Church History</em></a>) agree in acquitting Vespasian of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">St. Linus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> whose death occurred during this period, cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, while St. Apollaris of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, though a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, may very well have suffered at the hands of a local mob.

<p>The character of this emperor showed very little, if anything, of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> tyrant. Though himself a man of no literary culture, he became the protector of his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the Jewish historian <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, a worshipper of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">One God</a>, and even permitted him the use of his own family name (Flavius). While this generosity may have been in some degree prompted by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus's</a> shrewd prophecy of Vespasian's elevation to the purple, there are other instances of his disposition to reward merit in those with whom he was by no means personally sympathetic. Vespasian has the distinction of being the first Roman Emperor to transmit the purple to his own son; he is also noteworthy in Roman imperial history as having very nearly completed his seventieth year and died a natural death: being in feeble health, he had withdrawn to benefit by the purer air of his native <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Reate</a>, in the "dewy fields" (<em>rosei campi</em>) of the Sabine country. By his wife, Flavia Domitilla, he left two sons, Titus and <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, and a daughter, <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>, through whom the name of Vespasian's empress was passed on to a granddaughter who is revered as a confessor of the Faith.
