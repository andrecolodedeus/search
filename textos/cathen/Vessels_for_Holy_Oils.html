<h1>Vessels for Holy Oils</h1>  

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity there existed an important category of vessels used as receptacles for holy oil. These were the <em><a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampullae</a></em> or <em>pittacia</em>, which varied greatly in material as well as shape, being of wood, metal, <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, and even more frequently of earthenware. Sometimes the vessel was flat-shaped, resembling the <em>bulla</em>, or again it took the form of a thimble or little flagon. Those most numerous at present are the "ampullae of <a href="../cathen/10178d.htm">St. Menas</a>". There was scarcely a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> that did not have its beneficial or <a href="../cathen/11228d.htm">miraculous oil</a>, which would be carried great distances to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> or to relieve the sick. On this point there is abundant ancient testimony. To the oil was attributed a participation in the virtues of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with whom it had in some way been in contact. Hence, not alone the oil from lamps that had burned before their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> but that also which was supposed to have issued from the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> themselves or from the images of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> was prized. The most celebrated document on this subject is the "Index oleorum" or "List of the holy oils", sent to Queen Theodelinde by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>. This list was accompanied by <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampullae</a>, a certain number of which have been preserved in the treasury of the Basilica of Monza.

<p>Towards the close of the sixth century the custom of reserving to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> had been established and gradually propagated, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to provide themselves with oil sufficient for their needs throughout the year. If, at the time of receiving the new oil, any of the old was still unused, it had to be destroyed, that is, either burned or thrown into the piscina of the church. Each church, therefore, had but a limited number of vessels destined to hold the oils. The councils of the ninth and succeeding centuries frequently warned the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to take precautions against the stealing of the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a>. Indeed, in those days malefactors entertained the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that they would not be discovered if they would but rub their bodies with the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a>. In order to prevent such <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a> were kept in some secure place, either in a closet or in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>.

<p>The material of the vessels has varied greatly. In the fourth century <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus of Mileve</a> relates that the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> seized and profaned a glass vessel filled with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">holy chrism</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., vol. XI, col. 972). In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> crystal, gold, silver, and less precious metals were used. A thirteenth-century rock crystal vase from the Abbey of Saint-Evroult (Orne) is three and one-half inches in height and is surmounted by a lid of silver gilt encrusted with coloured stones (de Caumont, "Ab&eacute;c&eacute;daire d'arch. religieuse", p. 567); an inventory of Old St. Paul's, London, mentions three silver <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampullae</a> containing oil and <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> (Dugdale, "Monast. anglic.", III, 310) and an inventory of the Laon <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in 1523, mentions three large phial-shaped silver vessels used for keeping the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">holy chrism</a>, holy oil, and oil for the sick. In the interior of each receptacle was a long silver rod that served as a spoon. Inventories of Jumi&egrave;ges and Rouen, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> speak of vessels of gold and of silver gilt enclosed in a small cabinet and furnished with spoons for the extraction of the liquid. These vases are designated as flagons, <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampullae</a>, <em>estuy</em>, and <em>phialae</em>, and the cabinet containing them is known as the <em>chrismatorium, chrismate, cresmeau, and coresmier</em>. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> drew up minute instructions concerning the vessels for the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a>. He declared that each individual church should have two, either of silver or pewter, for each kind of oil, each vessel bearing the name of the oil contained therein. Almost the same rules are observed today. The vessels are usually cylindrical in form and fitted with screw tops marked with the letters: S. C. (<em>sanctum chrisma</em>); O.S. (<em>oleum sanctum, oil of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a></em>); O. I. (<em>oleum infirmorum</em>).
