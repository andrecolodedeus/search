<h1>Vestments</h1>  

<h2>In western Europe</h2>

<p>By <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments are meant the vestments that, according to the rules of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or from ecclesiastical usage, are to be worn by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in performing the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, consequently, above all, at the celebration of the Mass, then in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, at <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, the solemn recitation of the canonical hours, public services of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">processions</a>, etc.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> are: the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, tunicle, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, <a href="../cathen/04351a.htm">cope</a>, <a href="../cathen/13434a.htm">sandals</a>, stockings (or <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">buskins</a>), <a href="../cathen/06589a.htm">gloves</a>, <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, succinctorium, and <a href="../cathen/05785b.htm">fanon</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has the most elaborate and the greatest number of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments, for all the vestments mentioned belong to him. The vestments of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> are the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>--vestments which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> wears at the celebration of the Mass--then, in addition, the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04351a.htm">cope</a>. Besides the vestments worn by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> includes also the <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, <a href="../cathen/13434a.htm">sandals</a>, <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">buskins</a>, <a href="../cathen/06589a.htm">gloves</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>; those of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> include further the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a> vestments consist of the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>; those of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">lower clergy</a> wear the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestment, a vestment that belongs to all the grades of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>.
<h2>In the east</h2>

<p>There are also <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments in the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a>. They are fewer than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> vestments of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">western Europe</a> and vary from these also as regards form, nature, and use. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> vestments of the East and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> agree in essentials. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments worn in all <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> as well as in <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">western Europe</a> are: the under-tunic (<a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>), the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion">omophorion</a> (<a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>). In the East the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> is still bell-shaped, but, according to present usage, is slit in front in some <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. It is customary only in a few of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a> to use the <a href="../cathen/07542b.htm">humeral veil</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> as in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, still, some, instead of a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, have a hat like the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>, a covering like a turban, or, lastly, a <a href="../cathen/04463a.htm">cowl</a> or veil. The vestments peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> are: the sakkos, the outer vestment of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, which is like a <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>; the epigonation of the Greeks and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, a rhombic-shaped ornament of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> that hangs on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> side to below the knee, hence the name; lastly the epimanikia, cuffs, or <a href="../cathen/06589a.htm">gloves</a> with the part for the hand cut off, customary in all <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a>. <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">Pontifical vestments</a> are the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> head-covering, excepting in the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">Rite</a> where the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> also wears such a covering for the head, the sakkos, the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion">omophorion</a>, the epigonation, and the epimanikia.
<h3>Liturgical vestments in a more general sense</h3>

<p>Besides the vestments worn by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there are various other articles of clothing worn by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> which are not, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, designated as <em>vestes sacrae</em>, but which, nevertheless, in a general sense can be included among the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments. Thus, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, there are the cappa magna, the <a href="../cathen/07464a.htm">amess</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10624b.htm">mozetta</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> the mandyas (mantle) of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the biretta-like covering for the head called kamelaukion, which, when worn by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, has a veil called exokamelaukion.
<h3>Origin</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments have by no means remained the same from the founding of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until the present day. There is as great a difference between the vestments worn at the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> in the pre-Constantinian period, and even in the following centuries, and those now customary at the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as between the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and that of modern times. Just as the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> that today surround the celebration of the Sacred Mysteries are the product of a long development, so are also the present <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments. It was sought at an earlier era to derive the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress from the vestments of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a>. Yet even a superficial comparison of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments of the New Covenant with those of the Old should have sufficed to show the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of such an opinion. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> vestments did not originate in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; they have, rather, developed from the secular dress of the Graeco-Roman world. The influence of the dress of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> cult upon the form of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress can only conceded in this sense that the recollection of it must have made the use of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> garments specially reserved for the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> appear not only entirely in keeping with the dignity of the mysteries of religion, but even necessary. This influence, however, was clearly general in <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, not such as to make the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress the prototype of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.
<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Four main periods may be distinguished in the development of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress. The first embraces the era before Constantine. In that period the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress did not yet differ from the secular costume in form and ornament. The dress of daily life was worn at the offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In times of peace and under normal <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> better garments were probably used, and these were especially reserved for the celebration of the Sacred Mysteries. It would undoubtedly have <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> the faithful if they had seen the dusty, dirty, or worn garments. The opinion which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> expresses--"The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Divine religion</a> has one dress in the service of sacred things, another in ordinary intercourse and life"--is certainly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> also for the pre-Constantinian period, which it is hardly permitted to regard as a period of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> barbarism. It is even possible, though not demonstrated, that, as early as the close of the pre-Constantinian period, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> insignia came into use among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, as the orarion, or <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion">omophorion</a> or <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>.

<p>The second period embraces the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> from about the fourth to the ninth century. It is the most important epoch in the history of liturgical vestments, the epoch in which not merely a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress in a special sense was created, but one which at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> determined the chief vestments of the present <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress.

<p>The process of development which was completed in this period includes five essential elements: definitive separation of the vestments worn at the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices from all non-liturgical clothing, and especially from that used in secular life; separation and definitive settlement of certain articles of dress; introduction of the <em>sacrales distinctiva</em>; employment of the vestments definitively assigned for use at the Divine offices with retention of the ordinary clothing under these vestments; lastly, introduction of a special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> for the vestments intended for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use.

<p>It cannot be decided positively how far this development was consummated by means of mere <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a>, and how far by positive ecclesiastical legislation. However, it may be taken as <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the growth of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress did not proceed everywhere at a equal pace, and it is very probable that this development was completed earlier and more rapidly in the East than in <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Europe</a>, and that the Orient was the prototype for <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Europe</a>, at least with regard to certain garments (stole and <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>). It was of much importance for the forming of a special <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> costume differing from the garments ordinarily worn, that the poenula (cloak or mantle) and the long <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>, which came into universal use in the third century and were also worn in the offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, were gradually replaced in daily life, from about the sixth century, by the shorter <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> and the more convenient open mantle. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> did not join in this return to the former fashion, but retained the existing costume, which was more suitable to the dignity of the Divine offices; this fact in itself was the beginning of a <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrically</a> distinct <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress. As regards the influence of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> upon the development of a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> costume in other parts of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Europe</a>, such influence cannot have been of much importance outside of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> before the eighth century. The case, however, was different in the eighth century, and as early as the ninth century <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> was authoritative nearly everywhere in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>. The great simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress in the pre-Carlovingian era is very striking. The dignified shape with many folds that is constantly met in the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and pictures of that era did not in fact require decoration, which at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> was limited almost exclusively to the <em>clavi</em>, the red ornamental trimming of the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>.



<p>The third period, extending from the ninth to the thirteenth century, completed the development of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vestments in <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Europe</a>. It ceased to be customary for the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> to wear the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>. The tunicle became the customary vestment of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> was the vestment exclusively worn at the celebration of the Mass, as the pluvial, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> caps, took its place at the other functions. Another, and new vestment is the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, which, appearing in the course of the eleventh century, began in steadily increasing measure to replace the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>. In the third period, above all, the pontifical dress received its definitive form. This was the natural result of the enormous advance in the secular importance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and of their position in public life, which occurred in the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> era. Vestments such as sandals and <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">stockings</a> became exclusively episcopal ornaments. New <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">pontifical vestments</a> were the gloves, the succinctorium, and the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, to which were added among the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/12651c.htm">rational</a>, an imitation of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalarius</a> wrote his treatise, "De officiis ecclesiasticis" at the beginning of the ninth century, eleven garments were included among <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments: <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, cingulum, <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, <a href="../cathen/13434a.htm">sandals</a>, <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">pontifical stockings</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments numbered seventeen, the <a href="../cathen/05785b.htm">fanon</a>, that is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, not being included among these. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have claimed that the development of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress in the third period was due to the formulation of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>. However, this is entirely incorrect. As early as about 800, therefore, before the discussion concerning the Eucharist, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress was complete in all its essential parts. The introduction of the pluvial, or <a href="../cathen/04351a.htm">cope</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> arose from the desire to be more comfortable; but the development of the <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">pontifical costume</a> was based, as has been said, upon the important secular position which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> enjoyed from the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> era, which naturally brought about a corresponding enrichment of the <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">pontifical dress</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> exerted no influence upon the development of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>--the development of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress in the other <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> cannot be traced in this period--only the <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">pontifical dress</a> was enriched. The new <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">pontifical vestments</a> were: the sakkos, still a patriarchal vestment; the epimanikien; the epigonation, in so far as this vestment had not already been introduced before the ninth century; the epigonation first had the form of a handkerchief and was called enchirion (hand-cloth, handkerchief), it was not named epigonation until the twelfth century.

<p>In the fourth period, from the thirteenth century to the present <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, the history of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments is almost entirely the history of their <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> evolution, their adornment with <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> and ornamental trimmings, and the nature of the material from which they are made. For the various particulars the reader is referred to what is said in the articles devoted to the various vestments. In general the tendency in the fourth period has been towards greater richness of material and ornamentation, but, at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, towards greater convenience, therefore, a constantly increasing shortening and fitting to the figure of the vestments, naturally impairing the form and <a href="../cathen/01174c.htm">&aelig;sthetic</a> effect of the vestments. The <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> alone has been permitted to grow into a tower disproportionate in shape. Taking everything together, the development which <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments have experienced since the thirteenth century, and more especially since the sixteenth century, hardly appears to be a matter of satisfaction, notwithstanding all the richness and costliness of ornamentation, but rather a lamentable disfigurement <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the taste of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>In the East there has been little or no development in the fourth period. The one vestment which has been added to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">episcopal mitre</a>.
<h3>Liturgical vestments and Protestantism</h3>

<p>As is known, all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> rejected the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. It would therefore have been <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> if all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> had done away with <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments. For even though they are not in themselves essential to the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, being only something external, yet by their entire history they are connected most intimately with it.

<p>Of all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> action was taken only be the <a href="../cathen/12710a.htm">Reformed Churches</a> (<a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglian</a>), which did away entirely with the Mass and the Mass vestments, and substituted for these vestments in the church service a dress taken from secular life. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> did not show themselves so <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, in agreement with their rejection of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> and the degrees of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, they rejected the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, the symbol of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, as well as the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a> and <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, the insignia of the higher orders, but they retained the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a> or <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> for the celebration of Communion; and this was the case in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> until the eighteenth century; in isolated cases the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> is worn there even now; it is worn also in Scandinavia, where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> retained the <a href="../cathen/04351a.htm">cope</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> up to the present <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the first edition of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a> in 1549 still permitted the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, cappa, and <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a>; three years later, however on account of the greatly increased strength of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, the second edition of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer Book</a> only allowed the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> and <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the third edition, of 1559, issued during the reign of Elizabeth, restored the force of the regulations of the first edition, but only in theory. In practice the regulations of the second edition prevailed. Further, the attempt of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the Convocation of Canterbury to save at least the cappa and <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> had no permanent success on account of the domination of <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritanical</a> opinions. Not even the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, the minimum of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dress, remained in universal use. A movement for the revival of the old <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments began in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with the appearance of <a href="../cathen/13090a.htm">Ritualism</a>. Although the ecclesiastical authorities fought the revival with determination, yet is has continually advanced until now there are at least 2000 <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> churches where the old <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments have been reintroduced.
<h3>Blessing of the liturgical vestments</h3>

<p>Not all the <em>vestes sacrae</em> necessarily require a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>. This is strictly commanded only for the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, and perhaps also the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments is a prerogative of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; others can <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> them only when specially empowered to do so. Vestments that have been <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> lose the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> when the form is essentially altered, when they are much worn, and are therefore unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> service, finally, when very greatly repaired.

<p>On account of the lack of positive information, it cannot be even approximately settled as to the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> at which the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments was introduced. The first <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> statements concerning the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments are made by the pseudo-Isidore and <a href="../cathen/02466a.htm">Benedict Levita</a>, both belonging to the middle of the ninth century, but the oldest known formula of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, which is in the Pontifical of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, belongs to the end of the ninth century, for the benedictory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the Pontifical of <a href="../cathen/05326a.htm">Egbert of York</a> are an interpolation of the tenth century. From the twelfth century and especially in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the forms of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> were very numerous. The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the vestments was probably always the prerogative of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though this is not expressly mentioned before Gilbert of Limerick in the early part of the twelfth century. In the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments is also customary; it is given by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but in case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can perform the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. The benedictory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> are very similar to those in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. It is perhaps even more difficult to determine the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> when the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the vestments in the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> began than to settle its <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> in Western Europe.
<h3>Symbolism</h3>

<p>It has been said at times that <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> considerations were the cause of the introduction of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments and consequently of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But this is absolutely wrong. These <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> considerations did not create the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress; they are, rather, the result of the appearance of these vestments and of the defining of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> ones.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion">omophorion</a> and orarion were the first to receive symbolical interpretation, which was given by <a href="../cathen/08185c.htm">Isidore of Pelusium</a> (died about 440); the earliest symbolism of the entire <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> is found in the <em>Historia ekklneiastike</em>, probably of the eighth century. This work was the basis of the symbolical interpretation of the sacred vestments among the Greek <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> until the late <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In Western Europe the first attempt to give a symbolical meaning to the vestments of the Mass is found in what is called the <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican</a> explanation of the Mass. However, it was not until the ninth century that a more complete symbolism of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dress was attempted in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> interpretation became from this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> a permanent theme for the writers on the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, both in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and in modern times. In the symbolical interpretation of the sacred vestments, <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalarius of Metz</a> became especially important. Even in his lifetime <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalarius</a> aroused much opposition on account of his symbolism, which, it must be acknowledged, was not seldom peculiar, labored, and arbitrary. In the end, however, his <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> interpretations, which in reality contained many beautiful and edifying thoughts were greatly admired and were a model for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> until far into the thirteenth century. Various traces of the influence of <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalarius's</a> interpretations are evident even in the late <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. A symbolism, however, appeared even as early as the ninth century in certain <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that are spoken when putting on the sacred vestments, and the words pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at an <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, when he gives the garments to the newly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. It should, however, be said that up to the twelfth century these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> appear only occasionally in the Sacramentaries, <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missals</a>, and Pontificals, but after this they soon appeared more frequently in those books. It is a striking fact that the symbolism of these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> often pursues its own course without regard to the interpretations of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a>. It was not until towards the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> that a greater agreement arose between the symbolism of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> and what might be called the official symbolism of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> expressed in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in question; this official symbolism, moreover, differed greatly at different periods and in different places.
<h3>Characterization of the symbolism</h3>

<p>This is not the place to enter into the details of the many interpretations which the various <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments have received and which, notwithstanding the chaff, contain much pure wheat. (For such detailed presentation cf. Braun, "Geschichte der liturg. Gewandung", pp. 701 sqq.) It must suffice here to give them a general characterization.

<p>The symbolism customary among the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> from the ninth to the eleventh century is a <em>moral</em> symbolism, that is the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments were made to symbolize the official and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of their wearers. In the twelfth century there were added to this the <em>typico-dogmatic</em> symbolism, in which the vestments were expounded in reference to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Whose representative is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and soon they symbolized <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Christ's Incarnation</a>, the two Natures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the unity and relation to each other of these natures before long, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His teaching, and soon, lately, His relations to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Curious to say the vestments were not made to symbolize <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion and Death</a>. This last symbolism, which may be called typico-representative, first appeared in the course of the thirteenth century, and quickly became very popular, because it was the most easily expressed and consequently most easily understood by the people. The people interpreted the vestments as symbolizing the instruments of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, as the cloth with which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> head was covered (<a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>), the robe put on him in mockery (<a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>), the fetters (<a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>), etc., and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who was clothed with these was regarded as typifying the suffering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>.

<p>A fourth method of interpretation may be called the <em>allegorical</em>. This method of interpretation looks upon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> as the warrior of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who fights with the foe of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the people, and regards his vestments as his weapons in this spiritual struggle. The first traces of this symbolism are found in the ninth and tenth centuries, but are not seen in a developed form until the twelfth century. However this last method of symbolism was never very widespread. As early as the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> symbolism was customary in the putting on of the vestments, and in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> service. The typical reference to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was always foreign to them.

<p>Up to the fifteenth century it was customary among the Greek <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> to make use, almost exclusively, of typical symbolism. It was not until later that they employed <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> symbolism; this symbolism apparently arose while putting on the vestments, a <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that had in the meantime come into use. In these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments symbolize the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of their wearers.
