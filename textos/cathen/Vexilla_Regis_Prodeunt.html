<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Vexilla Regis Prodeunt</h1>  

<p>This "world-famous <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, one of the grandest in the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>" (Neale), and "surely one of the most stirring strains in our <a href="../cathen/07596a.htm">hymnology</a>" (Duffield), was written by <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a>, and was first sung in the procession (19 Nov., 569) when a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>, sent by the Emperor Justin II from the East at the request of St. Radegunda, was carried in great pomp from <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> to her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint-Croix at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. Its original processional use is commemorated in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is carried in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> from the Repository to the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">High Altar</a>. Its principal use however, is in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> assigning it to <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> from the Saturday before <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a> daily to <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of feasts of the Holy Cross, such as the Finding (3 May), the Exultation (14 September), the Triumph (16 July, "pro aliquibus locis").

<p>Originally the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> comprised eight stanzas. In the tenth century, stanzas 7 and 8 were gradually replaced by new ones ("O crux ave, spes unica", and the <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>, "Te summa Deus trinitas"), although they were still retained in some places. Stanza 2 survived the omission of the other two, and passed from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> into many printed breviaries. The correctors of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> under <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> revised the whole <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> in the interest of classical prosody. They omitted stanzas 2, 7, and 8, which are as follows: <blockquote> Confixa clavis viscera <br>Tendens manus, vestigia <br>Redemptionis gratia <br>Hic immolata est hostia. <br> <br>Fundis aroma cortice, <br>Vincis sapore nectare, <br>Iucunda fructu fertili <br>Plaudis triumpho nobili. <br> <br>Salve ara, salve victima <br>De passionis gloria <br>Qua vita mortem pertulit <br>Et morte vitam reddidit. </blockquote>

<p>Pimont thinks the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> has lost nothing by the omissions, and that "Its movement is more active and its unction more penetrating". The correctors also replaced the last two lines of the first stanza by those of the eighth, and changed "reddidit" into "protulit", giving us the stanza as now found in our breviaries: <blockquote> Vexilla regis prodeunt, <br>Fulget crucis mysterium, <br>Qua vita mortem pertulit <br>Et morta vitam protulit. <br> <br>[Abroad the royal banners fly <br>And bear the gleaming Cross on high- <br>That Cross whereon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Life</a> suffered death <br>And gave us life with dying breath.] </blockquote>

<p>It is unnecessary to indicate more in detail the changes wrought by the correctors, as our Breviaries give the revised text, and the Vatican Graduale gives the ancient text. In general, the changes made by the correctors in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> are not liked by <a href="../cathen/07596a.htm">hymnologists</a>. Some exceptions taken by the Abb&eacute; Pimont to those made in the "Vexilla Regis" are noted in the appended bibliography. The Vatican Graduale gives plain evidence of the desire and purpose of the Commission on Plain Chant, established by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, to restore the original texts. The Antiphonary (1912) gives equal evidence of an intention to retain the revised texts. Thus the Graduale (1908) gives only the ancient form of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, while the Antiphonary gives only the revised form. Curiously, the Processionale (1911) gives both forms.

<p>"Vexilla" has been interpreted symbolically to represent <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the Eucharist, and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. <a href="../cathen/04058a.htm">Clichtoveus</a> explains that as vexilla are the military standards of kings and princes, so the vexille of Christ are the cross, the scourge, the lance, and the other instruments of the Passion "with which He fought against the old enemy and cast forth the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a>". Kayser (p. 397) dissents from both, and shows that the vexillum is the cross which (instead of the eagle) surmounted, under Constantine, the old Roman cavalry standard. This standard became in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> hands a square piece of cloth hanging from a bar placed across a gilt pole, and having <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> on it <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> symbols instead of the old Roman devices. The splendour and triumph suggested by the first stanza can be appreciated fully only by recalling the occasion when the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> was first sung--the triumphant procession from the walls of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes in attendance and with all the pomp and pageantry of a great <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> function. "And still, after thirteen centuries, how great is our emotion as these imperishable accents come to our ears!" (Pimont). <a href="../cathen/06683b.htm">Gounod</a> took a very plain melody based on the chant as the subject of his "March to Calvary" in the "Redemption", in which the chorus sings the text at first very slowly and then, after an interval, fortissimo. There are about forty translations into English verse.

PIMONT, Les Hymnes du Br&eacute;vaire Romain, III (Paris, 1884), 30-46, thinks the correctors erred in transferring the last two lines of the eighth stanza to the first stanza (footnote, pp. 36-38), and also in changing "reddidit" to "protulit", since "reddidit" is the more exact and theologically appropriate word (footnote, p. 34), and dislikes the "Dicendo nationibus" of the third stanza as a correction of the original "Dicens: in nationibus", this latter being the reading of all the old manuscripts and an exact reproduction of the Vulgate reading, Psalm xcv, 10 (except that "gentibus" is used for "nationibus"): "Can it be believed that the presence of a trochee in the third foot, surely inoffensive enough, would suffice for its rejection?" Holding that Justin Martyr's charge that the Jews had suppressed the "a ligno" is now untenable, Pimont thinks that Fortunatus may have borrowed it from some of the Latin Fathers who maintained its correctness, or perhaps from a copy of the Psalms in which a gloss had crept into the text. Apropos of this stanza, Julian (loc. cit. supra) thinks its best English translation is that of BLOUNT in The Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary in English (1687), which first appeared in Blount's Office of Holy Week (Paris, 1670), "Abroad the regal banners Fly": <em>"That which the Prophet-King of old <br>Hath in mysterious Verse foretold, <br>Is now accomplisht, whilst we see <br>God ruling nations from a Tree".</em> SHIPLEY, Annus Sanctus (Londonm 1874) 94-100, gives trs. of KENT, AYLWARD, CAMPBELL, Evening (1710); and in the appendix, trs. of Primers of 1604, 1619, 1685, 1706.
