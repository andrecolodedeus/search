<h1>Viaticum</h1>  

<h2>Name</h2>

<p>Among the ancient Greeks the custom prevailed of giving a supper to those setting out on a journey. This was called <em>hodoiporion </em>"Convivium, quod itineris comitibus pr&aelig;betur" (Hedericus, "Lex. gr&aelig;c-lat."). The provision of all things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for such a journey, viz. food, money, clothes, utensils and expense, was called <em>ephodion</em>. The adjectival equivalent in Latin of both these words is <em>viaticus</em>, i.e. "of or pertaining to a road or journey" (<a href="../cathen/05747a.htm">Facciolati</a> and <a href="../cathen/06134a.htm">Forcellini</a>, "Lexicon"). Thus in Plautus (Bacch., 1, 1, 61) we read that Bacchis had a supper prepared for his sister who was about to go on a journey: "Ego sorori me&aelig; coenam hodie dare volo viaticam", and (Capt. 2, 3, 89), "Sequere me, viaticum ut dem trapezita tibi", and in Pliny (VII, ep. 12, in fine), "Vide ut mihi viaticum reddas, quod impendi". Subsequently the substantive "viaticum" figuratively meant the provision for the journey of life and finally by metaphor the provision for the passage out of this world into the next. It is in this last meaning that the word is used in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">sacred liturgy</a>.

<p>Formerly it meant anything that gave spiritual strength and comfort to the dying and enabled them to make the journey into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> with greater confidence and security. For this reason anciently not only any sacrament administered to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at the point of death, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (<a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, "Hom. in sac. Bapt."; <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, "Orat. de bapt."), confirmation, penance, extreme unction (Moroni, "Diz. di erudizione stor.-eccl.), Eucharist (Fourth Counc. of Carthage, cap. 78, calls it "viaticum Eucharisti&aelig;"), but even <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> offered up or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> performed by themselves or by others in their behalf, e.g. alms-deeds (<a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>), and finally anything that tended to reconcile the dying with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> came under this designation. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> "viaticum" was applied to the Eucharist generally, but finally it acquired its present fixed, exclusive, and technical sense of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> given to those in danger of death. The <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Catechism of the Council of Trent</a> (De Euch. sacr., n. 3) says: "Sacred writers call it the Viaticum as well because it is the spiritual food by which we are supported in our mortal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, as also because it prepares for us a passage to eternal glory and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>". As early as A.D. 325 the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> given to the dying was called the "last and most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> Viaticum" (Council of Nice, can. 13). Although Aubespine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, in his note on this canon says that "viaticum" here means only the reconciliation and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> granted at the hour of death to public penitents who had not performed the prescribed canonical penance, yet Macri (Hierolexicon) declares that it means simply "Sacramentum Eucharistic, cui antonomastice nomen veri muniminis convenit". <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> (402-17), in "Ad Exsuperium", and the First Council of Orange, 441, employed this word in the same sense.
<h2>Minister</h2>

<p>Formerly Viaticum was administered not only by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but also by <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of inferior orders and even by lay people. During the persecutions lay people carried <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> particles to their homes and administered <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to themselves, and it is natural to conclude that they received it as Viaticum in the same manner. <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> ("Ep. ad Fabium Antioch." in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.44</a>) relates that Serapion, an old man in danger of death, received Viaticum from his nephew, a mere boy, who had received the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> particle from a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. From a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (Regino, "De eccl. disc.", I, cxx) it appears that sometimes even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> carried the Viaticum to the dying, which practice the Council strictly forbade. Apparently for a while it was difficult to eliminate this abuse, for <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims</a>, required the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> visitors to inquire whether the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> gave Communion to the sick with their own hands or by others', "per se et non per quemlibet", and whether they gave the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> particle to any lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, "cuiquam laico", to carry it home for the sake of giving it to the dying (Mart&egrave;ne, "De antiq. eccl. rit.", I, I, v, 2). After the tenth century no mention is made of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a> carrying Viaticum to the dying, but <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> regularly administered it, and from two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Casalis Benedicti it is evident that <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> carried it to the house of the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> administered it (Mart&egrave;ne, <em>ibid</em>.). At present only <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or their assistants carry and administer it to the dying. In case of necessity a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> my be delegated, and if the necessity be urgent this delegation need not be waited for (Lehmkuhl, II, 135).
<h2>Subject</h2>

<p>All, even children who have reached the age of reason (Decr., <a href="../cathen/12590b.htm">"Quam singulari"</a>, pr&aelig;scriptio VIII, 8 Aug., 1910), are bound by Divine precept to receive the Viaticum when they are in danger of death, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; though it is disputed whether one who is now in danger of death and who has within the last few days received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> is so bound by Divine precept. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in the latter case is not clear, as the previous Communion in all probability satisfies the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> (Slater II, v, 1; Lehmkuhl, II, n. 146). St. Liguori says that according to the more probable opinion the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> exists (VI, n. 285, dub. 2, sec. sent.). If a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> becomes dangerously ill on the day on which he received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> out of devotion, it is disputed whether he may, or is bound to, receive it as Viaticum (Slater and Lehmkuhl, ibid.). <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De syn. dioc., VII, xi, n. 2) leaves the decision of this question to the prudent discretion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but St. Liguori <em>(ibid., </em>tertia sent.) thinks that the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound to receive it if the danger comes from an external cause, but not if he were already ill or if the danger already existed in some internal though unknown cause, as might be presumed in case of sudden illness, e.g. apoplexy and the like. Viaticum, like <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, out of devotion, may not be given to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are insane and who have never had the use of reason (Rit. Rom., Tit. IV, n. 10). To <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> labouring under insanity from fever or other causes and at the time incapable of sentiments of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, Communion cannot be administered; if, however before they became insane they evinced <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and religious sentiments and led a good life and it is apprehended that they will not recover their reason until they are dying, Viaticum may be administered to them in their delirium provided there be no danger of irreverence (Catech. of Council of Trent, II, vi, n. 64). It should not be administered when there is danger of irreverence to the sacrament from incessant coughing, difficulty of breathing or swallowing, and frequent vomiting. In all these cases, a little food or drink may be given first, to try whether the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can receive without danger of rejecting the Sacred Host. The same may be done in case of delirium also. Many recommend the trial to be made with an unconsecrated particle (O'Kane, "On the Rubrics" n. 782). Public sinners ("Publici usurarii, concubinarii, notorie criminosi, nominatim excommunicati aut denuntiati"-Rit. Rom., Tit. IV, cap. iv, n. 1) are not allowed to receive Viaticum until they have repaired, as far as circumstances will permit (the confessor must decide in each case the nature and extent of this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>), the injuries and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> of which they have been the cause.


<h2>Species</h2>

<p>Formerly Viaticum was usually administered under the species of bread, because the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, which was to be carried to the house of the dying <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, was customarily reserved under this form only. The incident, related above, of the aged Serapion would indicate this, for the boy was instructed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to dip the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> particle into water before giving it to his uncle. To this rite the Fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (Can. 76) seems to allude, because it states "infundatur ori eius Eucharistia" when Viaticum was to be given to dying <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who, on account of the parched state of the throat, were unable to swallow the Host. About the twelfth century the custom of receiving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> out of devotion under both species began to be disused (<a href="../cathen/03588c.htm">Chardon</a>, "Storia dei sacramenti", I, III, vii). It cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that, as long as this custom prevailed, Viaticum was often administered in the same manner when it was given after Mass, celebrated in the room of the dying <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, which was frequently done. Menard, in his notes on the "Gregorian Sacramentary" says that it contained two separate forms for the administration of Viaticum, "Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat te in vitam &aelig;ternam" and "Sanguis Domini nostri Jesu Christi redimat te in vitam &aelig;ternam". Sometimes the Host was dipped into the Precious Blood, as is evident from many ancient Rituals, and the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> prescribes "Sacra oblatio (Host) intincta debet esse in Sanguine Christi, ut veraciter presbyter possit dicere-Corpus et Sanguis Domini proficiat tibi" (Mart&egrave;ne, <em>ibid.</em>). Although anciently it was the custom to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> during Mass under both species (also Viaticum after Mass), yet it was never believed that those who communicated under the species of bread only did not receive, whole and entire, the Body and Blood of Christ. At present Viaticum is administered, at least on the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, under the form of bread only.
<h2>Rites and ceremonies</h2>

<p>Things to be prepared.-(a) By the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.-The <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a>, a small corporal, and a purificator in small <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a>, a white (even on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>) stole, and a Ritual. (b) In the sick room.-A table (near the foot of the bed, or in some other position in which it is easily visible to the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>), a crucifix (although this is not prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>), two lighted wax candles, a wineglass containing a little water for purifying the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> fingers, a clean cloth or napkin for the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, a vase containing <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and a sprinkler of box or other wood. (c) On the altar.-Two lighted wax candles, the key of the tabernacle and a <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a> with a large corporal (if the particle is to be transferred from the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> in this case also an ablution cup and a finger towel). It frequently happens that all the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things are not prepared in the sick room, therefore it will be expedient for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to carry with him two wax candles, <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and a small communion-cloth.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, having placed the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a>, which should hang on his breast by a cord round his neck goes to the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> house, reciting on the way the "Miserere" and other psalms and canticles he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by heart. At the door of the sick-room he says: "Pax huic domui" and if there be no one to answer, he replies himself: "Et omnibus habitantibus in ea", enters the room, puts on his stole, takes out the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a>, places it on the table, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a>, and rises. Then he takes the <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> and sprinkles first the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the form of a cross, i.e. in front of himself, then on his (own) left, then on his (own) right, after which he sprinkles some around him on the floors and walls of the room and on those present, saying in the meantime: "Asperges me . . . dealbabor", to which he adds the first verse of the "Miserere", "Gloria Patri" "Sicut erat", and then repeats the antiphon "Asperges me", etc. which must not be changed during <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Paschal time</a>. He immediately subjoins the versicles "Adjutorium", etc. and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Exaudi nos", etc.

<p>If the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has not previously confessed, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should ask those present to leave the room; then he hears the confession, imposes a light penance, and may recall the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> attendants. Even if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> had previously heard the confession, he should not administer Viaticum until he has given the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> an opportunity to confess again, if he desires it. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then goes to the table, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a>, and uncovers the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a>, and the communion-cloth or napkin is adjusted under the chin of the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who recites the "Confiteor", if he be able; if not, it is said in his name by one of the bystanders, or, when there is no one able to do this, by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> himself. After the "Confiteor" the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a>, rises, and turns towards the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, taking care, however, not to turn his back to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. In this position he says "Misereatur" and "Indulgentiam" using the words <em>tui, tuis, tuorum,</em> and <em>tibi.</em> (The singular is used when Communion is given to one who is sick, except in the rare case in which it is given during Mass, when the plural form is used. "Sacrorum Rituum Cong.", 16 Nov., 1906.) The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then turns to the table, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a>, and takes the particle between the thumb and index finger of the right hand and holds the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> in his left hand under the particle. The "Ecce Agnus Dei" and the "Domine non sum dignus" are said as prescribed for the ordinary Communion in the church. The sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should say the "Domine non sum dignus" with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, at least once, in a low tone (Rit. Rom. Rubr., 19). Instead of the "Corpus Domini", the form "Accipe frater (soror)" etc. is used, whether the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or not, for it is always used when the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is in probable danger of death. It is a very probable opinion that Communion may be administered the next day, and even every day, and while the danger continues the form should always be "Accipe frater" (O'Kane, <em>op. cit</em>., 777). If difficulty is experienced in swallowing the Host on account of the parched condition of the throat, a little water may be given to the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> before he receives <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, or the Host may be placed in some wine or water in a spoon or a little wine or water may be given immediately after receiving the Host.

<p>If the danger of death be imminent, but the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be able to receive, all the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, as far as the "Misereatur", may be omitted. In case of extreme necessity the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may even omit the "Misereatur" and the following, and give Communion immediately. In these cases the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which were omitted are not supplied afterwards, even though the state of the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should allow this. If it be feared that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> will be unable to swallow the Host before death, it should not be given. If it be given and death ensue before he can swallow it, it should be removed from his tongue and placed either in a corporal or in some vessel and kept in some secure place and in due time put into the sacrarium. Should the Host not be visible in the mouth, nothing further need be done (Dunne, "The English Ritual Explained", 67; De Herdt, III, n. 191; O'Kane, <em>op. cit., </em>n. 823). If the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, after bringing the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, finds unexpectedly that the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is unable to communicate, he may give benediction with it to the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But he is never allowed to bring the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> for this purpose when he knows that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> will be unable to receive. Should the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he unable to retain the Sacred Host, it should be removed and carried to the church in a corporal or clean vessel. There it should be kept in a becoming place until it corrupts, when it should be put into the sacrarium.

<p>After the Communion the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> purifies the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> and his fingers in a small glass of water, and the water is given by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or one of the attendants, to the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to drink. If the latter be unable or unwilling to take it, it may be thrown into the sacrarium or into the fire at the house. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may, if he wish, purify the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> and his fingers by rubbing them with one part of the little purificator previously moistened with water. The purificator should then not be used again before it is washed. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then says <a href="../cathen/05114a.htm">"Dominus vobiscum</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Domine sancte", etc. If no particle remains in the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with his hand in the same manner as after Communion in the church, using the form "Benedictio Dei", etc. O'Kane (n. 835) thinks that since we use "tui" instead of "vestri" in the "Misereatur", there is sufficient reason to justify the use of "super te" instead of "super vos" in this blessing; the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> "eum manu benedicit" seems to favour this opinion, although authors who give the form in full say it ought to be "super vos". If a particle remain in the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a>, puts the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a>, and, without saying anything, gives the blessing with the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a>, puts off his stole and <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, and returns to the church reciting on the way the Psalm, "Laudate Dominum de coelis", etc. (This <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> ought to be observed, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give Viaticum to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in different houses, until the last particle is given, for the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> says: "Si altera particula Sacramenti superfuerit".) Having arrived at the church he places the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> on the corporal, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a>, descends to the lowest step and there recites the versicles "Panem de coelo", etc. and <a href="../cathen/05114a.htm">"Dominus vobiscum</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Deus qui nobis", etc., after which he announces the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of seven years and seven quarantines to those who accompanied the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> <em>with</em> a light, and five years and five quarantines to those who accompanied it <em>without</em> a light. He then ascends to the predella, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a>, gives the blessing to the assembled people in the church with the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> and places the latter in the tabernacle in the customary manner.

<p>From the Mass of <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> till the Mass of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> the colour of the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> must be white, the "Gloria Patri" is recited at the end of the Psalms, and the blessing with the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> may be given in the room of the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but not in the church. It may happen that Viaticum is to be given during Mass, e.g. to a criminal about to be executed, in an <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> or private house, when the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is in view of the altar. The rites and ceremonies observed in such cases are exactly the same as when Communion is given in the church, except that the form will be "Accipe frater (soror)". The colour of the vestment will be suited to the Mass. When Viaticum is administered to two or more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at the same time, it is given to them successively, as in the church, provided they be in the same apartment or in apartments opening into each other. In this case "Misereatur <em>vestri . . . vestris" </em>and "Indulgentiam <em>. . . vestrorum . . . vobis" </em>are said; the ablution may be given to any one of them, and need not be divided; in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Domine sancte" the words "fratri nostro" or "sorori nostr&aelig;" are changed into "fratribus nostris", or, if all are <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, "sororibus nostris", and at the end the blessing with the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> is given only once to all together.
