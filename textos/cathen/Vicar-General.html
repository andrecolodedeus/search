<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Vicar-General</h1>  

<p>The highest official of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> after the ordinary. He is a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> legitimately deputed to exercise generally the episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, so that his acts are reputed the acts of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself.

<p>The wide powers of administration now enjoyed by the vicar-general belonged formerly to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. The latter official was the first among the seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, a number long retained in many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and he held office, not by reason of priority of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but by free appointment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. To him was generally committed the external administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, including the control of the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the right of visiting and correcting all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> by judicial procedure.

<p>In the sixth century, there were both urban and rural <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were divided into districts ruled by these officials. This custom began in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and later spread all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. By the eleventh century, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> had become ordinary and stable. They had courts of first instance, and, besides their contentious <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, they had wide administrative powers, so much so indeed that they became obnoxious to the legitimate exercise of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> authority. In consequence, from the twelfth century onwards, we find new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> assistants of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, later called vicars-general, or officials, removable at the will of the ordinary. Vicars-general are not named in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, but they are frequently referred to in the Sixth Book of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> (e.g., cap. ii, iii, "De off. Vic.", I. 13 in 6) and in the Clementines (cap. ii, "De reser.", 1.2. in Clem). In large <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and some other countries, a distinction was made between the vicar-general, who had <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> or administration, and the official, who had contentious <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but this distinction was never received into the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, and the titles <em>vicar-general</em> and <em>official</em> are used indiscriminately for the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees. The institution of vicars-general greatly limited the powers of the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, and finally the latter officials were reduced by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. xii, "De ref.") to mere honorary dignitaries in <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters.

<p>According to the present discipline, the vicar-general is deputed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to exercise the latter's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> with a certain universality of power. Bishops could not of themselves be competent to establish officials with the same ordinary faculties which they themselves have, and consequently the office of vicar-general rests on powers communicated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, therefore, cannot concede to the vicar-general any <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> except within the bounds allowed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or legitimate custom, or express <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">Apostolic indults</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the vicar-general is necessarily universal in the whole diocese, both for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and causes, with a universality, however, not absolute, but moral, and therefore, though the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can restrict it both as to places and causes, he cannot so limit it that it ceases to be general, at least morally. It is in the discretion of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to constitute a vicar-general for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but he cannot suppress an office instituted by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>.

<p>The office of vicar-general is unique, and therefore there should not be several of them in one diocese, either acting in concert or governing a special part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (S.C.C., 21 Feb., 1614). However, separate vicars-general may be appointed for the faithful of a different rite or language (C. 14, X, 1, 31). The cleric appointed as vicar-general should be of legitimate birth, <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibate</a>. He should have attained his twenty-fifth year and be commendable for the probity of his life, his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of canon law, in which he should be a doctor or licentiate, or at least equivalently qualified. Statutes of particular councils and <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a> of <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> declare that the vicar-general should not have the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, but this is nowhere prescribed in <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, and though an urban <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, or a capitular office, or the rectorship of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> are hindrances to the liberty of a vicar-general, yet they are not strictly incompatible with it. Regulars cannot be appointed vicars-general without the permission of their religious superiors, and they need, in addition, the license of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to live outside their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. It is expedient that the vicar-general should not be a blood relation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but there is no general law to this effect, though the <em>schema</em> of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> contains one (Jus. Pont. de Prop. Fid., VI, append.).

<p>The power of the vicar-general, by reason of his office and deputation, extends to all causes in the ordinary episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, except those which <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may have reserved or made dependent on a special mandate. The tribunal of the vicar-general is one with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and therefore there is no appeal from one to the other. The vicar-general cannot substitute another cleric in his place to exercise his whole <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but he may appoint delegates for special causes. Owing to the dependence of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the vicar on that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it ceases or is impeded with the latter. When, however, the vicar is acting in a special case as a strict delegate, he may even then finish the cause he had begun. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a vicar-general, according to most canonists, is of a class by itself between ordinary and delegated, and it may be called quasi-ordinary, because, on the one hand, it is connected with a certain office by legal enactment and, on the other, it is exercised not in his own, but another's name. As ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, however, is always exercised by him as a matter of fact, there is no reason why his power should not be called ordinary. By virtue of a general mandate, the vicar-general exercises ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but for some causes he needs a special mandate. These are: to make a visitation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to confer <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> of free collation, to punish the excesses of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or remove them from their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> or offices, to use the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> faculties of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> and suspension, to concede dimissorial letters for receiving orders. All of the above require a special mandate by explicit law, but others of a similar nature, according to canonists, also require this mandate. They are: to suppress, unite, or divide <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, to admit resignations for the purpose of exchanging <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, to convoke a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, to erect <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and confraternities. The office of a vicar-general expires with his death or resignation; with the cessation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; with the revocation of his vicarial mandate, which must, however, be justified by a grave cause and against which, if his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> be impugned, he has recourse to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
