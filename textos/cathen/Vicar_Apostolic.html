<h1>Vicar Apostolic</h1>  

<p>(1) In the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> committed to some <a href="../cathen/12785b.htm">residentiary</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of watching over <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters in a certain region, as the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles for Gaul and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> for <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>. These <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were called vicars Apostolic.

<p>(2) Prelates with the title of vicar Apostolic are sometimes commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to administer <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> which are vacant, or whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are prevented from exercising their ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by some impediment. These vicars Apostolic have the powers of <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicars capitular</a> and at times receive also some extraordinary faculties, which much be learnt from their <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of appointment.

<p>(3) In regions where the ordinary <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not yet been established, and which consequently fall under the ordinary and immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a special manner, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> usually governs such missionary regions by means of a delegate who has received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to some <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>, and who is designated a vicar Apostolic.

<p>These <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> generally have the same powers that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have by common law in their own <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> also concedes to them various extraordinary faculties. All these powers, however, are delegated, not ordinary. As they are not diocesan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, they have not <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or chapter (S.C. Prop., 27 Nov., 1858). Without special concession from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, they may not concede the usual forty days <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, nor erect a throne in a church, nor wear the capa magna, nor have their names inserted in the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">canon of the Mass</a> (Collect. S.C. Prop., 1883 n. 139, etc.). While they may not constitute ordinary vicars-general, they can give special faculties to various <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to assist them in administering the vicariate. They must, in addition, name some proper secular or <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> cleric who, in case of their unexpected demise, may rule the region as pro-vicar until other provision is made. The pro-vicar has the same faculties as the vicar, except those that flow from episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. He can, however, in case of necessity <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">patens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01348b.htm">portable altars</a>, with oils <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Regulars in a missionary district must communicate their letters patent to the vicar Apostolic, and in the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> are subject to his authority. Vicars apostolic are appointed outside of Consistory by a special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">pontifical brief</a>, and later this provision is merely published in Consistory. All matters concerning the promotion of vicars Apostolic are conducted by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> on the lines of the Constitution, "Gravissimum", of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (18 Jan., 1757) and the later Decrees of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (Collect. S.C. Prop., n. 38-87). There are about 150 vicariates in existence at present.
