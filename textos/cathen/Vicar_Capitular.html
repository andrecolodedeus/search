<h1>Vicar Capitular</h1>  

<p>The administrator of a vacant diocese, elected by a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. On the death of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the canons of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter (where such exists) inherit the episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> as a body corporate. Within eight days of the vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, however, they must meet and constitute a vicar capitular (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXIV, c. xvi, de ref.). If they neglect this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, the right passes to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, or, in case the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> is in question, to the senior suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or, when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is exempt, to the nearest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In constituting a vicar capitular, a strict form of election need not be followed; but if suffrages are cast, they should be secret, and no one may vote for himself. The vicar chosen should be a doctor of licentiate in canon law if possible, and though a canon is commonly to be chosen yet this is not required for validity.

<p>On his election the vicar succeeds to all the ordinary episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> that the chapter had inherited, nor can the chapter reserve any part of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to itself, nor constitute only a temporary vicar, nor remove him. Faculties which are committed to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for a term of years, pass also to the vicar capitular (S. Off., 22 Apr., 1898), in which are included the powers usually granted for dealing with a certain number of cases (S. Off., 3 May, 1899). Canonists usually hold that perpetual delegations to ordinaries, sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, pass likewise to the vicar capitular. Faculties, however, which had been granted to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> personally are not extended to the vicar. There are, nevertheless, some limitations on the power of a vicar capitular, even as regards ordinary episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Thus, he may not convoke a synod or visit the diocese unless a year has elapsed since these offices were performed. He may not grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. He should not undertake any new work or engagements that might prejudice the action of the in-coming <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Hence, during the first year of vacancy, he can promote to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a> only those who are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive that dignity through possession of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. The vicar cannot grant the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> of free collation, nor may he suppress them and unite them to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. He may not alienate the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> or of the episcopal mensa. He can, however, grant permission for the alienation of the goods of inferior churches. He can neither begin nor pursue a judicial process concerning the goods or <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. The vicar cannot give permission for the erection of a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or a new confraternity (S.C. Ind., 23 Nov., 1878). Canonists usually declare that a vicar capitula can receive extern <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but deny that he can excardinate the home <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. If the vicar is in episcopal orders, he can perform all that belongs to the ministry of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; otherwise he may invite a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from another diocese to exercise such functions. If the vicar die or resign, the chapter must elect another within eight days, but the newly-elect must not be one who has already received the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the vacant see. In case the removal of the vicar capitular becomes <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, this may be done only by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The office of a vicar capitular ceases when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has been promoted to the diocese presents his letters of appointment to his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has the right of demanding an account from the chapter and vicar capitular of all their acts of administration, and of punishing any dereliction of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>.
