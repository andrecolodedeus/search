<p>FERNANDO PO, in West Africa.--In 1855 a mission was established in the island of Annobon, Corisco, and Fernando Po under R. P. Miguel Martinez, of Toledo. In 1857 the mission became a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a> and was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; in 1860 their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was extended to the mainland. After thirteen years' labour they gave up the mission owing to difficulties with the Spanish Government, as well as to the severity of the climate. Till 1883 there was only one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the mission, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Santa Elisabeth in Fernando Po. In 1883 the prefecture was revived and the mission entrusted to the Congregation of the Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. On 25 April, a large territory on the continent was added to the mission, which on 5 May, 1904, was made a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. The vicariate now comprises the Islands of Annobon (11 sq. miles), Corisco (11 sq. miles), Elobey, Fernando Po (780 sq. miles), and Spanish Guinea (12,000 sq. miles), extending from the Muni river to the Campo and to Kamerun, the eastern boundary being the meridian of 11 degrees 20 minutes E.; it has in all an area of about 12,814 sq. miles and a population of 235,000. The languages ordinarily spoken in the mission are: Bubi in Fernando Po; Benga in Corisco; Ambu in Annabon, and Pamwe and Kombe on the mainland. The climate in the mission territory is torrid and enervating, and malaria is prevalent. There are 6274 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 370 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>; 42 missionary priests; 10 catechists; 13 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; 9 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 27 stations; 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 1170 pupils; 4 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. The Sisters of the Immaculate Conception have 6 houses with 26 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The first Vicar Apostolic is Mgr. Pedro Armengaudio Coll, of the Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, appointed on 10 May, 1904. He is <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14636a.htm">Thignica</a>, and resides at Santa Isabel, Fernando Po.

Its boundaries are: on the north the 20 degree S. lat., the southern limits of Autsirabe, the 20 degree S. lat. again, and then to the Indian Ocean; on the east the Indian Ocean from 20 degrees to 22 degrees S. lat.; on the south the Vicariate Apostolic of Fort Dauphin (formerly Southern Madagascar); on the west the Mozambique Channel from 20 degrees to 22 degrees S. lat. On 16 May, 1913, R.P. Charles Givelet, S.J., was appointed first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>.

<p>FORT-DAUPHIN, in Madagascar.--In order to distinguish more easily the various vicariates in <a href="../cathen/09509e.htm">Madagascar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> decreed on 20 May, 1913, that the vicariates should be called in future by the name of the town in which the vicars reside. Hence the name of the Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Madagascar was changed to Fort-Dauphin.

<p>GUAM, ISLAND OF, in the Mariana Islands.--The Mariana Islands with the exception of Guam belong to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; Guam is held by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 March, 1911, Guam was withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> of the Mariana Islands, and made a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, to prevent troubles arising from differences of nationality. The new vicariate was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and Mgr. Francisco Xavier Ricardo Vila y Mateu, O.F.M. Cap., b. at Arenys de Mar, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, was appointed on 25 Aug., 1911, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Adraa. In 1911 the population was 12,240, of whom 11,877 were natives; there are about 2500 non-Catholics. The vicariate has 10 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 10 churches. The Island of Guam lies at the Southern end of the Mariana group and was ceded to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1898; it is about 30 miles long and 6.5 miles wide, and has an area of about 200 sq. miles.
