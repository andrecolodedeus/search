<h1>Vicariate Apostolic of Northern Germany</h1>  

<p>(VICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF THE NORTHERN MISSIONS)

<p>Its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> covers the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Meeklenburg-Strelitz, the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, the free Hanse towns, <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/09401a.htm">L&uuml;beck</a>, and Bremen, the Principality of L&uuml;beck (capital Eutin), belonging to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, and the Island of Helgoland. The Northern Missions, viewed in a wider sense, include also the Prefecture Apostolic of Schleswig-Holstein, coinciding with the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of that name, which was placed under a separate <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in 1868. Both vicariate and prefecture are under the permanent <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> as administrator Apostolic. In the vicariate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number about 79,400 (with 1,925,000 members of other congregations), under 47 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> having care of 17 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 17 mission stations. The following religious congregations have houses in the vicariate: <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of Mercy of St. Charles Borromeo</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a> (Grey Nuns), 5; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, 2; <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, 2. The Prefecture Apostolic of Schleswig-Holstein contains (1909) 11 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 31 mission stations, 34 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 35,900 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 550,000 of other <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>; 4 communities of <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a>, and 3 of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. In summer the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the vicariate and prefecture is increased by 17,000 to 20,000 labourers (chiefly Poles) from other parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who return to their homes at the beginning of the winter. The spiritual interests of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are inadequately attended to owing to the extent of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the poverty of the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and, in many places, owing to the intolerance of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> state or municipal governments. A more encouraging picture is presented by the numerous <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and by the maintenance of private <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, despite the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are often <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contribute also to the support of the state and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. A very fruitful activity has been developed in these missions by the Boniface Association.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the sixteenth century caused the loss of almost all Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1582 the stray <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, as well as of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, were placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. The Congregation de propaganda fide, on its establishment in 1622, took charge of the vast missionary field, which at its third session it divided among the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> (Denmark and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>), the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> of Cologne (North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (Sweden). The scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were chiefly confided to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in many places had at their disposal only the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> established in the houses of the diplomatic representatives of the emperor, and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Powers, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Sometimes admission even to these <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> was rendered difficult, or entirely prohibited to native <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>In some districts the conversion of the princes, e.g. Duke Johann Friedrich of Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg (1651) and Duke Christian of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1663), brought <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> some measure of freedom. The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> having increased in 1667, chiefly through the above-mentioned Duke of Brunswick, a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> was established for Northern Germany. The first vicar was Valerio Maccioni, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, who resided at <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. He died in 1676, and was succeeded by the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> convert, Nicolaus Steno, who in 1680 was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, was made Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, and in 1683 returned to the Northern Missions. He died at Schwerin in 1686, and was followed in the vicariate successively by Friedrich von H&ouml;rde, Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> (1686-96), Jobst Edmund von Brabeck, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> (1697-1702), and Otto von Bronckhorst, Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>. Owing to its vast extent, the old <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> was divided by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Pope Clement XI</a> into two vicariates (1709): the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> (or upper and Lower Saxony), embracing the portions of the old vicariate situated in the Palatinate and Electorates of Brandenburg and Brunswick, which was placed in charge of <a href="../cathen/14284b.htm">Agostino Steffani</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Spiga and minister of the Elector Palatine, as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>; the rest of the original vicariate (Denmark, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/09401a.htm">L&uuml;beck</a>, <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, Altona, and Schwerin), which retained the title of Vicariate of the North and was placed under the Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>. This division lasted until 1775, when Friedrich Wilhelm von Westfalen, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, reunited under his administration the vicariates except <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> and Sweden.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> regime brought great relief to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in many cities and states; but the equality granted them by law in some countries was often merely theoretical. At the reorganization of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> after the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> era, the greater part of the Northern Missions was added to adjacent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. The only districts remaining mission territory were the <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Kingdom of Saxony</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01513e.htm">Principality of Anhalt</a>, constituted separate <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> in 1816 and 1825 respectively, and the North, which in 1826 was placed temporarily under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. In 1839 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> wished to entrust the vicariate to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>. Johann Theodor Laurent was appointed vicar and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> opposition prevented the realization of the plan and Laurent was unable to reach Hamburg. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> thereupon gave the administration of the vicariate to the Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, Karl Anton L&uuml;ppe (d. 1855). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> has since then been the regular <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Northern Missions, and administrator of the Prefecture Apostolic of Schleswig-Holstein, separated from the vicariate in 1868. In 1869 <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> was erected into a prefecture, and in 1892 into a vicariate.
