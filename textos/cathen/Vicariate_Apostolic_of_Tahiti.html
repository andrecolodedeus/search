<h1>Vicariate Apostolic of Tahiti</h1>  

<p>Tahiti, the most important of the Society Islands, has an area of 600 square miles and a population of 11,691 inhabitants, and lies between 17&ordm; 29' 30" and 17&ordm; 47' S. latitude and 151&ordm; 29' 53" and 151&ordm; 56' W. longitude. It was discovered by Wallis in 1757. This <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is also claimed for Fern&aacute;ndez Quiros, the pilot of the <a href="../cathen/10179b.htm">Menda&ntilde;a</a> expedition from <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, about 1600. Bougainville, Cook, and other explorers made Tahiti famous in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> as "La Nouvelle Cyth&egrave;re", and in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> aroused an enthusiasm for "the lovely isle", which led to the formation, by Dr. Haweis and others, of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Missionary Society in 1794-95, and the despatch of the "Duff" in 1796 with some 60 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, missionaries and teachers of trades and crafts, for the conversion of the island and its neighbours. The representatives of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> made little progress until Pomar&eacute; II, King of Tahiti, accepted <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in 1815. Under his successors they gained great influence in the island government. In 1836 two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary of Picpus arrived in Tahiti from the Gambier Islands, where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> had gained a foothold. They were twice expelled by Queen Pomar&eacute; IV, with the support and <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">English Protestant</a> missionaries, and took their cause to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1838 a French naval expedition exacted from Queen Pomar&eacute; an indemnity and guarantees for the future for French residents in the island. In 1841 a mission was established by the Congregation of Picpus. In 1842 Pomar&eacute; IV signed a convention with Admiral Dupetit-Thouars, establishing a French protectorate and guaranteeing full religious liberty in Tahiti, which was ratified by Louis-Philippe in 1843. An uprising of the natives against the protectorate resulted in a punitive expedition by the French admiral, the flight of Queen Pomar&eacute;, and the forcible expulsion from the island of Rev. W. T.  Pritchard of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Missionary Society, whom the admiral held responsible for the revolt. This act was disavowed by the French Government and an indemnity paid to Great Britain based upon the claim that Pritchard, at the time of his expulsion, had been appointed British consul.

<p>In 1848 Tahiti with its dependent islands was detached from the Vicariate of the Marquesas, and placed under the able and scholarly Mgr Jaussen. In 1880 King Pomar&eacute;, with the consent of the French Chambers, proclaimed Tahiti an integral part of the French Republic. In 1887 the French Government secularized the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Upon the death of Mgr Jaussen in 1891 Mgr Verdier, his assistant since 1884, succeeded to his labours, made doubly difficult by the sectarian missions and the attitude of French officials. Since 1903 the various groups of French islands in Oceania, exclusive of New Caledonia and its dependencies, have been united in one homogeneous colonial establishment, administered from Tahiti by a governor and privy council, with an administrative council. The present Vicariate of Tahiti covers the Society group, the Leeward and Gambier Islands, the Tuamotu group, Tubuai and Rapa, all belonging to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; the Cook and Penrhyn Islands, annexed to New Zealand in 1902; Pitcairn (unattached) and Easter Island, belonging to <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>. The Mission consists of: 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Mgr Hermel, whose residence is at Papeete, the chief town of Tahiti), 1 coadjutor with right of succession, 30 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and several brothers of the Congregation of Picpus; 6 brothers of Plo&euml;rmel; 12 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>; 50 other <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 24 <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny; 1 boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; 1 girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; 20 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. The total population of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate</a> is estimated at 31,000 inhabitants, with 7700 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
