<h1>Victor Augustin Isidore Dechamps</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; born at Melle near Ghent 6 Dec., 1810; died 29 Sept., 1883, at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. He and his brothers made rapid progress in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> under their father's direction. One, <a href="../cathen/04665a.htm">Adolphe</a>, entered on a political career. Victor pursued his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies first at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> and then in the Catholic University begun at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and afterwards transferred to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 20 Dec., 1834, he entered the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a> in 1835, and made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> 13 June, 1836. The next four years he spent at Wittem as prefect of students and <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. In 1840 he began his missionary life and in 1842 was nominated <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. He took an active part in the founding of the <a href="../cathen/07407b.htm">Confraternity of the Holy Family</a>, which he considered his most salutary work. In the historic jubilee of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> he had a large share both by his "Le plus beau souvenir de l'histoire de Li&egrave;ge", and by his preaching (1845-46). He visited <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and saw the wonderful effects of the Tractarian movement. In 1849 he was nominated consultor general of his congregation, and took up his residence at Pagani near <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> just when <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> was in exile at <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>. He had several audiences with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and was instrumental in arranging the transfer of the superior general from Pagani to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This was not effected till 1855, when <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> invited Father Dechamps to the first general chapter held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The question of his appointment to the <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">See of Li&egrave;ge</a> was considered in 1852, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, touched by his personal appeal, did not insist. In 1865 Dechamps became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, whence he was transferred in 1875 to the <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Archdiocese of Mechlin</a> and made <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>. At all times devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he took an active part in the formation of the pontifical zouaves, and persuaded General Lamorici&egrave;re to offer his services to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. But his prominence in the history of his country and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is due to his battle for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and his defence of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> before and during the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> and Dechamps were indefatigable; and they became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in the same consistory, 15 March, 1875. Dechamps worked to the very end. He said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> on 28 Sept., 1883, and died the day following in the arms of a <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> who happened to be present. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>, as he had desired, by the side of Venerable Passerat at Rumilliers.

<p>The complete works of Dechamps, revised by himself, were published in Seventeen volumes at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. In presenting fourteen of the seventeen volumes to <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 7 Feb., 1879, the author writes: "There is one thing that consoles me, Holy Father, in sending you my poor works: they are all <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of our holy Faith. . . . Volume I is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; II to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; V to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>; III and IV to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and St. Peter; VI to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>; VII, VIII, and IX to the refutation of modern <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV to my preaching as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and to acts by which I governed my diocese." Of the remaining volumes, XV, "M&eacute;langes", deals with many important questions; XVI and XVII contain letters on questions in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and other subjects. Cardinal Dechamps's brother, <a href="../cathen/04665a.htm">Adolphe</a>, was made Prime Minister of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 4 April, 1843. He was also minister of public works, and minister of foreign affairs from 30 July, 1845, to 12 June, 1847.
