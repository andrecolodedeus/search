<h1>Victor De Buck</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a>, born at Oudenarde, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, 21 April, 1817; died 28 June, 1876. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was one of the most distinguished in the city of Oudenarde. After a brilliant course in the humanities at the municipal college of Soignies and the <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em> of Roulers, and completed in 1835 at the college of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Alost, he entered this <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> on 11 October of the same year. After two years in the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, then at Nivelles, and a year at Tronchiennes reviewing and finishing his literary studies, he went to <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a> in September, 1838, to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, closing these courses with a public defense of theses bearing on these subjects.

<p>The work of the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> had just been revived, and in spite of his youth, Victor De Buck was summoned to act as assistant to the hagiographers. He remained at this work, in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, from September, 1840, to September, 1845. After devoting four years to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1848, and making his third year of probation in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, he was permanently assigned to the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> work in 1850, and was engaged upon it until the time of his death. He had already published in part second of Vol. VII of the October "Acta Sanctorum," which appeared in 1845, sixteen commentaries or notices that are easily distinguishable because they are without a signature, unlike those written by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>. Moreover, during the course of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies which suffered thereby no interruption, and before becoming a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he composed, in collaboration with Antoine Tinnebroeck, who, like himself, was a scholastic, an able refutation of a book published by the professor of canon law at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the regular <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were assailed and repudiated. This refutation, which fills an octavo volume of 640 pages, abounding in learned dissertation, was ready for publication with four months. It was to have been supplemented by a second volume which was almost completed but could not be published because of the political disturbances of the year 1847 which were but the prelude to the revolution of 1848, and the work was never resumed.

<p>Father De Buck's literary activity was extraordinary. Besides the numerous commentaries in Vols. IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII of the October "Acta Sanctorum," which won the praise of those best qualified to judge, he published in Latin, French, and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a>, a large number of little works of piety and dissertations on devotions to the saints, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and church archeology, the partial enumeration of which fills two folio columns of his eulogy, in the forepart of Vol. II of the November "Acta." Because of his extensive learning and investigative turn of mind, he was naturally bent upon probing abstruse and perplexing questions; naturally, also, his work was often the result of most urgent requests. Hence it was, in 1862, he was led to publish in the form of a letter to his brother Remi, then a professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> college of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and soon afterwards his colleague on the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> work, a Latin dissertation, "De solemnitate praecipue paupertatis religiosae," which was followed in 1863 and 1864 by two treatises in French, one under the title "Solution amiable de la question des couvents" and the other "De l'etat religieux," treating of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> in the nineteenth century.

<p>At the solicitation chiefly of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and distinguished <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> savants, he undertook the study of a particularly delicate question. In order to satisfy the many requests made to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by churches and religious communities for the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of saints, it had become customary to take from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a> the bodies of unknown personages believed to have been honored as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the early Church. The sign by which they were to be recognized was a glass vial sealed up in the plaster outside of the <em>loculus</em> that contained the body, and bearing traces of a red substance that had been enclosed and was supposed to have been blood. <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubts</a> had arisen as to the correctness of this interpretation, and, after careful study, Father De Buck was convinced that it was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and that what had been taken for blood was probably the sediment of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine which, owing to misguided piety, had been placed in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> near the bodies of the dead. This conclusion, together with its premises, was set forth in a dissertation in 1855 under the title "De phialis rubricatus quibus martyrum romanorum sepulcra dignosci dicuntur." Naturally it raised lively protestations, particularly on the part of those who were responsible for distributing the bodies of the saints, the more so, as after the discussion on the vials of blood, the <a href="../cathen/03341b.htm">cardinal vicar</a> in 1861 strictly forbade any further transportation of these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. The author of the dissertation "De phialis rubicatus," had but a few copies of his work struck off, these being intended for the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> particularly interested in the question, and as none were put on the market, it was rumored that De Buck's superiors had suppressed the publication of the book, and that all the copies printed, save five or six, had been destroyed. This, of course, was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>; not one copy had been destroyed, and his superiors had laid no blame upon the author. Then, in 1863, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was obtained from the Congregation of Rites, renewing an older <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, whereby it was declared that a vial of blood placed outside of a sepucral niche in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> was an unmistakable sign by which the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> might be known, and it was proclaimed that Victor De Buck's opinion was formally disapproved and condemned by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This too was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, as Father de Buck had never intimated that the placing of a vial of blood did not indicate the resting-place of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, when it could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the vial contained genuine blood, such as was supposed by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the congregation. Finally there appeared in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1867 a large quarto volume written by the Roman <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> Monsignor Sconamiglio, "Reliquiarum custode." It was filled with caustic criticism of the author of "De phialis rubricatis" and relegated him to the rank of <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who had combated devotion to the saints and the veneration of their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. Father De Buck seemed all but insensible to these attacks and contented himself with opposing to Monsignor Sconamiglio's book a protest in which he rectified the more or less unconscious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his enemies by proving that neither the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1863 nor any other decision emanating from ecclesiastical authorities had affected his thesis.

<p>However, another attack about the same time touched him more deeply. The gravest and most direct accusations were made against him and reported to the Sovereign Pontiff himself; he was even credited with opinions which, if not formally <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> at least openly defied the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> that are universally accepted and held in veneration by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> devoted to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In a Latin letter addressed to Cardinal Patrizzi, and intended to come to the notice of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Supreme Pontiff</a>, Father De Buck repudiated the calumnies in a manner that betrayed how deeply he had been affected, his protest being supported by the testimony of four of his principal superiors, former provincials, and rectors who eagerly vouched for the sincerity of his declarations and the genuineness of his religious spirit. With the fullest consent of his superiors he published this letter in order to communicate with those of his friends who might have been disturbed by an echo of these accusations.

<p>What might have invested these accusations with some semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and what certainly gave rise to them, were the amicable relations established, principally through correspondence, between Father De Buck and such men as Alexander Forbes, the learned <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the celebrated <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Edward Pusey</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Bishop Dupanloup</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and a number of others whose names were distasteful to many ardent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. These relations were brought about by the reputation for deep learning, integrity, and scientific independence that De Buck's works had rapidly earned for him, by his readiness to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> those who addressed themselves to him in their perplexities, and by his remarkable earnestness and skill in elucidating the most difficult questions. Moreover, he was equipped with all the information that incessant study and a splendid memory could ensure. But it was not only great minds groping outside the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith or weakened by harassing <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> who thus appealed to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The different papal <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> who succeeded one another in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> during the course of his career as <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, political men, members of learned bodies and journalists, ceased not to importune this gracious scholar whose answers often formed important memoranda which, although the result of several days and sometimes several nights of uninterrupted labor, were read only by those who called them forth or else appeared anonymously in some <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> or foreign periodical.

<p>Although Father De Back had an unusually robust constitution and enjoyed exceptionally good health, constant and excessive work at length told upon him and he was greatly fatigued when Father Beckx, Father General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, summoned him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to act as official theologian at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Father Victor assumed these new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with his accustomed ardor, and, upon his return, showed the first symptoms of the malady arterio-sclerosis that finally carried him off. He struggled for some years longer against a series of painful attacks each of which left him decidedly weaker, until a final attack which lasted uninterruptedly for nearly four years, caused his death.
