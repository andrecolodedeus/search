<h1>Victor IV</h1>  

<p>Two <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> of this name.

<p>I. Cardinal Gregory Conti, elected in opposition to <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in the middle of March, 1138, by the partisans of the Pierleoni <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, as successor to <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>. At the end of two months, however, Gregory submitted on 29 May to <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent</a> and renounced his office.

<p>II. Octavius, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of St. Cecilia, d. at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 20 April, 1164. He was elected 7 Sept., 1159, by a small minority of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (four or five), the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of St. Peter's, and the Roman populace, while at the same time the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">college of cardinals</a> elected the chancellor Rolando who assumed the title of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. Octavian belonged to one of the most powerful Roman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> (Counts of Tusculum), had been <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> since 1138, and was very popular on account of his liberality, accessibility, and splendour of living. He was considered a great friend of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, and rested his hopes on the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick Barbarossa</a>. Yet it is not to be assumed that the emperor had desired his election; Rolando was certainly not agreeable to him, yet neither was it to his interest to have an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. As a matter of fact the emperor was at first neutral and called upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> not to take sides; the decision, the emperor said, should be reserved for the action of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As the chief protector of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, therefore, he convoked a synod at Pavia (February, 1160). It decided, as was to be expected, for Victor, and pronounced an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> upon Alexander, while Alexander on his side <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the emperor. The attempt to secure Victor's recognition was never completely successful in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where Bishop Eberhard of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> was his principal opponent. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> sided with Alexander; <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> followed their example. King Louis VII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> wavered, indeed, once more in 1162, but the disastrous meeting with the emperor at Saint-Jean-de- Losne had as its result that the king held firmly to the obedience of Alexander. During the years 1162-65 Alexander lived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and from 1163 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> exerted himself to gain more of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> for his cause. All uncertainty came to and end at the death of Victor IV. His successor was <a href="../cathen/11515a.htm">Paschal III</a>.
