<h1>Victoria</h1>  

<p>(VICTORIEN. IN INS. VANCOUVER.)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in southwestern <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, of which province it is the capital, was known until recently, first, as the Diocese, and later, as the <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Archdiocese of Vancouver</a>. It is the mother-diocese of <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, for at its establishment in 1847 it comprised the mainland of this province and all the coast island, including the Queen Charlotte group. In 1863 the mainland became an Apostolic vicariate, and was afterwards erected into the Diocese of New Westminster, at which time the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a> was restricted to Vancouver Island and adjacent islands. Alaska, after its cession to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1867, was attached to this see, and remained so until 1894 when it became a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">ALASKA</a>). In 1904 the title was changed to that of the archdiocese, and in 1909 to that of the Diocese of Victoria, the <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Archdiocese of Vancouver</a> being then transferred to Vancouver City, B.C.

<p>As early as 1778 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries reached Nootka on the west coast of the island. Later, a sprinkling of settlers established themselves in the southern part, in what was known as Fort Camosun, a name afterwards changed to Victoria, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the reigning Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1843 Father Bolduc volunteered to minister to the spiritual necessities of these pioneers. In 1847 <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Rev. Modeste Demers</a>, a missionary of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, was called to take charge of the newly created See of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a>. He had already acquired personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and experience regarding the territory known as <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, and, before taking possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to secure <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and means for his needy diocese. Father, afterwards Bishop, Lootens was one of the generous volunteers. With characteristic energy, foresight, and wisdom, <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Bishop Demers</a> soon organized the district assigned him. To aid him, he brought the Sisters of St. Ann in 1858, and, the following year, the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>. The latter were given charge of the natives of the entire diocese, and established themselves with headquarters at Esquimalt; they remained until 1864. The former, devotedly both to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the care of the sick, are still actively engaged in various parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and have two institutions in Victoria, St. Ann's Academy for girls and St. Joseph's Hospital.

<p>Before the death of <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Bishop Demers</a> in 1871, he appointed as his administrator, the <a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Reverend C.J. Seghers</a>, who two years later became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> of his saintly predecessor marked his six years' tenure of office, when <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> appointed him coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Archbishop Blanchet</a> of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, with right of succession, and the <a href="../cathen/02798a.htm">Rev. J. B. Brondel</a> succeeded him in Victoria. Five years later, the latter was transferred to <a href="../cathen/07203a.htm">Helena</a>, <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Archbishop Seghers</a>, at his own suggestion, was appointed to the vacant see of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a>. Right Rev. J. N.  Lemmens (b. in Schimmert, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, in 1850) was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at the American College of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, in 1875, and came the following year to Victoria. In 1884, he was sent to represent the diocese at the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>. After the tragic death of <a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Archbishop Seghers</a>, Father Lemmens was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a>, in 1888. A lasting monument to his energetic efforts is the Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was completed in 1892. He died in 1897 in <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, Central America, where he was spending some months for the double purpose of soliciting contributions towards the payment of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, and of aiding the exiled <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a> by administering confirmation throughout the diocese. His successor, Right Rev. Alexander Christie, took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1898, and the following year was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/11293a.htm">Archdiocese of Oregon City</a>. Right Rev. Bertram Orth succeeded in 1899, and in 1903 was raised to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the newly established <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>. Owing to failing health, he resigned in 1908, and in 1909 Right Rev. Alexander MacDonald, of <a href="../cathen/01562c.htm">Antigonish</a>, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Victoria. Bishop MacDonald is well-known as a writer on religious subjects and questions of the day.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10378a.htm">Indian missions</a> both on the east and on the west coast of the island were established by the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and were, until recently, under their sole direction. In 1900, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a> of Mount Angel, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, and in 1903, the Fathers of the Company of Mary, came to take a share in the work of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. There are 2,500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians, and the total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is 10,000. There are 8 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 college, 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 24 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 13 missions, 19 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 40 stations.
