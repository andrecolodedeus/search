<h1>Vigevano</h1>  

<p>(VIGLEVANENSIS.)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, Province of Pavia. The city is a great agricultural centre. As late as the middle of the nineteenth century, gold was obtained from the Ticino in the neighbourhood, but that industry has since been abandoned. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built in 1100, rebuilt in the sixteenth century, and in the seventeenth by <a href="../cathen/03329c.htm">Bishop Caramuel Lobkowitz</a>, 1680, himself an architect, who also contributed to the expense. The Church of S. Pietro Martiere was built, with the adjacent <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, by Filippo M. Visconti in 1445; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is now used for government offices and courts. Among the civil edifices is the castle, once a fortress, built by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> in 1492, by order of Ludovico il Moro, and now a royal palace.

<p>The earliest notices of Vigevano date from the tenth century, when it was favoured as a residence by King Arduin for the sake of the good hunting in that vicinity. In the next period it was a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> commune, and was accordingly besieged and taken by the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> in 1201 and again in 1275. In 1328 it surrendered to Azzone Visconti, and thereafter shared the political fortunes of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. In the last years of the Visconti domination it sustained a siege by Francesco Sforza, himself a native of the city. With the Treaty of Worms (1743) it passed to the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. Blessed Matteo Carreiro, O.P., died at Vigevano. Until 1530 the town belonged to the <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Diocese of Novara</a> and had a collegiate chapter. Francesco Sforza procured the erection of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and provided its revenues. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Galeazzo Pietra, succeeded by his nephew Maurizio Pietra (1552); both of these promoted the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reforms, and the work was continued by their successors. Marsilio Landriani (1594) distinguished himself in various nunciatures and founded a <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> college for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young men. Giorgio Odescalchi (1610) was a very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>; the process of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> has been commenced. <a href="../cathen/03329c.htm">Giovanni Caramuel Lobkowitz</a> (1675) was an example of pastoral virtue and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and the author of many works, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, ascetical etc., though his "Theologia fundamentalis" was censured. Pier Marino Sonnani (1688), a <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a>, who enlarged the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, had to maintain a struggle against the spread of the doctrines of Miguel Molinos. Nicola Saverio Gamboni was intruded into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in 1801. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>. It contains 75 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 180,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, 250 secular and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 1 house of male religious, 1 of sisters, and 3 girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. One weekly and two monthly periodicals are published.
