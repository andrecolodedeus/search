<h1>Vilna</h1>  

<p>(VILENSIS).

<p>Vilna, the capital of <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, is situated at the junction of the Rivers Vileika and Vilja; population 165,000 in 1910. Its foundation is traced back to the twelfth, and even, by Polish writers, to the tenth century; but its historical origins must be referred to the year 1323, when Giedymin, Grand Prince of Lithuania, set up his capital there, wrote a letter to <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, and made treaty with the Brethren of the Sword. The German <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> partly devastated the city in 1383. When the grand Prince Jagiello, in 1383, received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and married Hedwige, Queen of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, taking the name of Wladislaus II, and uniting <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> with Lithuania, the religious and political prosperity of Vilna began. In 1577 it became the seat of a flourishing academy which gained a great literary reputation, especially under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In the later half of the seventeenth century and the earlier of the eighteenth it suffered much from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, fire, and pestilence. United with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1794, it ceased to be the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Polish insurrection of 1831 and 1863 exposed it to cruel reprisals; from 1870 it has developed industrially and commercially.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Vilna owes its foundation to Wladislaus II Jagiello (1383-1434), who was active in propagating <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>. In 1387 Jagiello sent Dobrogost, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Posen, as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (1378-87) to petition for the erection of an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at Vilna and the appointment of Andrew Wasilon (then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ceretenska) to fill it. This was granted and the foundation of a collegiate church of ten canons authorized. Under Wasilon's rule, the Churches of St. John, St. Martin, and St. Anne were built at Vilna. Upon his death, in 1398, he was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> James Plichta (1398-1407), in whose time the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was burnt down. Among his successors were: Peter of Kustynia (1414-21), whom <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> invested with full powers to bring back the Orthodox of Lithuania to the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; Matthias of Trok (1421-53), a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Lithuanian, who sent representatives to the Council of Basle and set up the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> to combat the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, founded many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and strenuously defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the Lithuanians. Under John Losowicz (1467-81) many <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> were converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (Bernardines) were established at Vilna. Albert Tabor, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Lithuanian, invited the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> to Vilna and entrusted to them the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Spirit; Albert Radziwill (1508-19) died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; John the Lithuanian (1519-37) held the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod at Vilna in 1526; Prince Paul Holszanski (1534-55) restored his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style and held a synod in 1555; Valerian Protasewicz Suszkowski (1556-80) had to contend for the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a> and the use of Latin in the Liturgy; he brought the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, among whom was <a href="../cathen/14034a.htm">Peter Skarga</a>, to Vilna.

<p>Prince George Radziwill (1581-91) fostered the Academy of Vilna, founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, introduced the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and, having been made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, was transferred to the Diocese of Cracow in 1591. The chapter then entrusted the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Ciprian. At his death, in 1594, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were divided into factions on the choice of a successor, until Sigismund III nominated Benedict Wolna (1600-15), who exerted himself efficaciously for the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Casimir of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the first stone of a church was laid at Vilna in 1604. He succeeded in his efforts to have St. Casimir regarded as patron of Lithuania. His successor, Eustachius Wollowicz (1616-30), founded <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, invited the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of the Lateran to Vilna, and energetically combated the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and the Orthodox. Abram Wojna (1631-49) introduced the Fatebene Brethren and strenuously opposed <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. George Tyszkiewicz (1650-6) annexed the whole of Courland to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Alexander Sapieha (1666-71) founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul, taking St. Peter's for his model. The diocese then comprised 25 deaneries with 410 churches. Constantius Casimir Brzostowski (1687-1722) brought the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a> to Vilna and encouraged the development of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. In the episcopate of Michael Zienkowicz (1730-62) there arose sad conflicts between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, resulting in the closing of the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarist</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Prince James Massalski (1762-94) encouraged the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and devoted his immense fortune to the churches of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>After the annexation of <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the Diocese of Vilna no longer enjoyed freedom of relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1795 the chapter nominated David Pilchowski vicar <em>in spiritualibus</em>. Livonia was added to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and John Nepomucene Kossakowski (1798-1808) was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He did much for the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. After his death the chapter became involved in a conflict with Siestrzencewicz, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of St. Petersburg, who usurped <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> exclusively belonging to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Siestrzencewicz forced upon the chapter, as administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Geronimo Strojonowski (1808-15), upon whose death he arrogated to himself the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Lithuania. In 1827, after Siestrzencewicz's death, the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, Milucki, ruled the diocese for a short time. In 1828 Andreas Klagiewicz was appointed administrator; he was sent to the interior of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> during the Polish insurrection of 1831, and returned to Vilna in 1832, was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vilna in 1839, and took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 28 June, 1841. He died the same year, after witnessing the ruin of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Uniat Church in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and a most ferocious <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The chapter elected John Cywinski as vicar suffragan; he had the grief of seeing the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Vilna closed, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and churches of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> completely despoiled of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and died on 17 Nov., 1846. In 1848 he was succeeded by Wenceslaus Zylinski, who was transferred in 1856 to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Mohilev, but continued to govern his former diocese until 1858. Adam Stanislaus Krasinski was expelled from the diocese in consequence of the Polish insurrection, but nevertheless continued to govern the diocese until 1883, when he withdrew to Cracow. His successor, Charles Hrynieweki, was exiled to Jaroslav after two years of the episcopate, and in 1890 abdicated and withdrew to Galicia. During his exile Ludovic Zdanowicz governed the diocese as vicar patriarchal. In 1890 Anthony Francis Audziewicz, a canon of St. Petersburg and a learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vilna. He died in 1895; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was then governed by Louis Zdanowicz, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05009a.htm">Dionysias</a>. In 1897 Canon Stephen Alexander Zwerowicz succeeded, and was transferred in 1902 to the See of <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a>. His place was taken by Baron Edward Ropp, who set about organizing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, thereby incurring the hostility of the Russian Government. Bishop Ropp having been banished to Pakov, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was entrusted to Casimir Nicholas Michalkiewicz as administrator Apostolic.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Vilna, presiding over a vast diocese and being senators of <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, could not give all their attention to the spiritual necessities of their flock; hence, from the fifteenth centuries they had coadjutors or suffragans. Many of these, particularly in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Methone (Peloponnesus). Among the most famous may be mentioned George Casimir Ancuta (d. 17370, author of "Jus plenum religionis catholicae in regno Poloniaw", showing that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and Orthodox had not the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Beginning from the seventeenth century there were also suffragans for Belorusi. In 1798 <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> recognized the ancient See of Brest as suffragan of Vilna. So also the ancient Diocese of Livonia, supressed in 1797, had become suffragan to Vilna, and in 1798 had for its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Adam Kossiafkowski (d. 1828); in 1848, however, it was annexed to the <a href="../cathen/13421b.htm">Diocese of Samogitia</a> or Kovno.
<h2>Synods</h2>

<p>The flourishing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life of the Diocese of Vilna is attested by the large number of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held there. The first of these was in 1502, under Bishop Tabor. Then followed the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of 1526, for the reform of manners and the organization of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; those of 1528, to collect funds for the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; of 1555, to oppose the spread of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>; of 1582; of 1607, which made many regulations for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; of 1630, which regulated the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>; of 1654, to aid the state with new imposts; of 1669 with its disciplinary regulations; of 1685, with ordinances relating to the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the life of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; of 1744, with regulations in regard to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, and spiritual exercises. After the synod of 1744, under Bishop Michael Zienkowicz, no others were held, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> addressed to their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> pastoral letters, some of them of notable import.
<h2>Churches</h2>

<p>The diocese possesses splendid churches and venerable sanctuaries. Of the former the largest and most beautiful are at Vilna, although many, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> wrested from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, have become Russian Orthodox churches. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated tot he <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, St. Stanislaus, and St. Wladislaus, was erected in virtue of a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 12 March, 1387. Burned down in 1399, it was rebuilt in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style in 1399 by Grand Duke Witold. Again destroyed in 1531 and 1662, its restoration was begun in 1769 and finished in 1801. It contains splendid <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, especially those of St. Casimir and of the Immaculate Conception. Other important churches are those of Holy Cross, founded in the fourteenth century on the spot where, in 1366, fourteen <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>; the Church of St. Martin, founded by Jagiello in 1380 on the ruins of an ancient <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple; St. Anne, founded for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> by Anna, the consort of Witold, in 1392; <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, founded in 1386 and enriched with privileges by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>; Corpus Domini, founded by the Archconfraternity of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in 1573; and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Guardian Angels. To these must be added the numerous churches of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, which flourished in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, but of which few traces remain. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who in the fifteenth century had a church dedicated to the Holy Spirit, built in 1679-88 another, which in 1844 was given up by them and transformed into a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. The <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a> undertook at Vilna, in 1469, the construction of a wooden church, rebuilt in stone in 1500; it was burnt down in 1794 and restored in 1900. This order was forced to leave the diocese in 1864. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul was given to the Lateran Canons in 1638; they abandoned it in 1864. St. Casimir, with the annexed <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, founded in 1604, was turned into an Orthodox church in 1832. <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>, founded by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1622, is now the club of the officials. The <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Church of St. Teresa has a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of the Madonna. The Augustinians, Trinitarians, <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Sisters</a>, <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, Visitandines, and others also had churches, to which must be added numerous <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. After the Polish Revolutions of 1863, the diocese saw all its religious <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> expelled. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were converted into barracks, the churches given to the Orthodox or the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> dispersed, the possessions of the religious confiscated. In 1910 there remained only one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters (connected with the Church of St. Catherine at Vilna) with six septuagenarian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Bernardine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Slonim with four septuagenarian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Grodno with a single friar, and, in the same city, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> Sisters with two religious. The efforts made since 1905 by the various orders to re-establish themselves in the diocese have been fruitless.

Besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> the city of Vilna contains those of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John Baptist</a>, the Holy Spirit, St Teresa, Sts. Philip and James, <a href="../cathen/12640b.htm">St. Raphael the Archangel</a>, <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, All Saints, the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the city is 96,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Dependent upon the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Teresa is the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of Our Lady of Ostrobrama, the centre of many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> also by the Orthodox. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> containing the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image stands upon an arch, and the street which passes under this arch is occupied at all hours of the day by a crowd of prostrate suppliants; no one passing under the arch &#151; not even the Hebrews &#151; will neglect to uncover the head in token of reverence.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> number about 440 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter comprises 5 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and 3 canons. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which has 15 professors and 160 students. Its foundation dates from 1582; it was closed in 1862; reopened in 1872, and had but two students, but their number gradually increased. At Brest there was a petit seminaire, which was closed in 1830; the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Bialystok was closed in 1842. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> has always exerted, and still exerts, a beneficial influence upon popular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. At the beginning of the nineteenth century twenty-five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were in operation at Vilna; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges were conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The monastic <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> were centres of culture. As late as the seventeenth century there were 101 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Missionaries of Vilna contained 8284 volumes; that of the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, 7000; that of the <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a>, 4142. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Vilna possessed 20,000 volumes of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, part of which were given to the Theological Academy of St. Petersburg, to the University of Kiev, and to the Public Library of Vilna.

<p>In consequence of the fierce <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> stirred up against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, the scientific glory of the Diocese of Vilna became obscured; but the Faith remained firmly rooted in the hearts of the people. Vilna is perhaps the most devout city in the Russian Empire, and its <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is all the more admirable because the paucity of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and the complete lack of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders render it difficult for the people to fulfil their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Of late years, however, the bitter quarrels between the Polish and Lithuanian Nationalists led to divisions in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> camp The Lithuanian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that in all the churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> Lithuanian shall be equally considered with Polish in religious instruction and in supplementary devotions. A portion of the Polish <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are opposed to these claims. But wise measures taken by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> have allayed the animosity, and opportune concessions to the Lithuanians have, at least in appearance, removed the causes of discord.
