<h1>Vincent Baron</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and preacher, b. at Martres, in the department of the Haute-Garonne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 17 May, 1604; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 21 January 1674. At the age of seventeen he passed form the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Thomas in the same city. There he made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, 16 May, 1622, completed his course in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and taught these branches. As early as 1634 he was first professor in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and conventual doctor in the University of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Rare erudition, depth of thought, and clearness of exposition earned for him the reputation of being one of the leading <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. While discharging his professorial <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> he delivered courses of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons in the principal churches of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and other cities of Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Upon the invitation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Languedoc he preached throughout their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for ten years, reviving the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, elevating their <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and combating the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, with whose <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> he frequently joined in open debate, sometimes in their public <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. He published an abridgment of these controversies under the title "L'heresie convaincue" (Paris, 1668). Of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregations we have only those preached at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1658 and 1659 (Paris, 1660), <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> discourses and panegyrics possessing much <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> merit, composed in the forced style and manner of his age. In the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> Father Baron was always a teacher; but while intent upon forming the minds of his hearers he won their hearts by his disinterestedness, sincerity, and charity. From 1630 to 1659 he filled the office of prior in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (twice), Rhodez, Castres, <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a>, <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and in the general <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, always promoting the reforms in study and religious observance inaugurated by Sebastian Michaelis in the first years of the century. In 1660, having declined the office of provincial in the Province of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, he was sent by the master-general of his order to make a <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he devoted himself during the remaining fourteen years of his life to the composition of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works.

<p>His most important productions were written to satisfy the desire expressed by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Pope Alexander VII</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> assembled in a general chapter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1656, that they should publish a course in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> conformable to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and thus correct the laxity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> encouraged by certain casuists. These works were: (1) "Theologiae Moralis adv. Laxiores probabilistas pars prior" (Paris, 1665); (2) "Manuductionis ad Moralem Theologiam pars altera" (Paris, 1665); (3) "Theologia moralis Summa bipartita" (Paris, 1667). In these works, while condemning opinions that seemed too lax, and censuring others that appeared to be too rigorous, he ably defended the system of Probabiliorism. With the famous critic Jean de Launoy he was long in controversy as to the "Summa Theologica" of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> the authenticity of which he ably defended, although he did not demonstrate it, as later writers have done. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of a work entitled "Apologia pro sacra congregatione Indicis" having been published with alterations made by a stranger, which brought upon it the condemnation of the Sacred Congregation, he promised a new edition, which was embodied in his "SS. Augustini et Thomae vera et una mens de libertate humana" (Paris, 1666). Another valuable work is his "Libri V apologetici pro religione, utraque theologia, moribus ac juribus Ord. Praed." (Paris, 1666). At the time of his death he was engaged on a complete course in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> to be entitled "D. Thomas sui Interpres". From this work, but half completed and never published, the one bearing the same title by Antoninus Massouli&eacute;, O.P., is entirely distinct.
