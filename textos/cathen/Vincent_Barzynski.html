<h1>Vincent Barzynski</h1>  

<p>Born at Sulislawice, <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a>, Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, 1838; d. at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 2 May, 1899. The son of Joseph and Mary (Sroczynska) Barzynski, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> he received the name Michael, but during a grievous illness was placed under the protection of <a href="../cathen/15437a.htm">St. Vincent Ferrer</a> and henceforth called Vincent. Because of frail health he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> privately. In 1856 he entered the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/09403a.htm">Lublin</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 28 Oct., 1861. After six months illness spent at the home of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, he was appointed vicar at Horodlo, member of the chapter of the collegiate church of the Zamojscy, and later transferred to Tomaszew, which was the scene of great military activity during the uprising of 1863. As organizer, appointed by the secret Polish national Government, he provided the insurrectionists with military supplies. Compelled soon after to flee to <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, he found refuge with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> fathers in that city. After fifteen months of wandering he received his passport enabling him to leave for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1865. Here he fell under the influence of that remarkable band of mystics, Semenenko, Kajsewicz, Jelowicki, and <a href="../cathen/10283a.htm">Mickiewicz</a>, the poet, who dreamed of Poland's resurrection through the spiritual regeneration of the Poles. Going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he joined the newly founded Congregation of the Resurrection and soon after receiving the special blessing of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> set out for America (1866). After several years' labour in the <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">Diocese of San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Stanislaus <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, in 1874. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> then comprised about 450 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>; in 1881 the number of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> was 988, and in 1887 reached 1700.

<p>Vincent Barzynski became the dominant influence throughout the most critical period of Polish immigration. He first gave the American Poles a class consciousness, amalgamated the various units into a compact working phalanx, and despite seemingly insurmountable difficulties crushed the forces that threatened the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Polish immigrants. Criticized for centralizing within his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> all authority, it must be recalled that he had to deal single-handed with every difficulty, that in large part the Polish American <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his day were deserving of little confidence, that the mass of Polish immigration was from the petty artisan and peasant class, and that the small number of brighter minds coming to America had left an unsavoury past behind them. It is clear that there was no alternative. The spirit of rebellion, "independence", <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was fanned by the Polish National Alliance, and this organization Father Barzynski so successfully combated that it was only after his death that the Alliance grew in members.

<p>St. Stanislaus <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, divided again and again, seemed never to decrease; Father Barzynski there organized nearly forty <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, confraternities, and sodalities. He assisted in the organization of nearly every Polish <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> established before his death. He built the magnificent St. Stanislaus Church and the great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (since destroyed by fire and rebuilt), where seventy <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> teach nearly five thousand children; gave the Poles an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>; founded St. Stanislaus College; introduced the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; formed with very raw material a corps of Polish teachers in his own <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; interested the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Polish immigration. Largely due to his influence, 800 Polish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> entered this community. He founded the first Polish <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, the "Gazeta Katolicka", his personal organ for many years, and established the first Polish daily <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in America, the "Dziennik Chicagoski", which for nearly twenty-five years has been a valiant defender of the Faith against the inroads of the liberal press, particularly the "Zgoda", the insincerely "neutral" organ of the Polish National Alliance. To him are due the first Polish American text-books, and the first Sunday-school papers. He saw the necessity of organizing the Poles along strictly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lines, and founded the Polish Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union. His greatest enemies admit him to be the most commanding figure in the brief but dramatic history of the American Poles. Despite constant criticism from both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, he remained indefatigable. He was a man of genuine <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and deep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, strict with himself alone, considerate of others. He was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, resourceful, daring, and patriotic and was possessed of real genius for organization. The noblest monument he has left is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that abides in three million Poles.
