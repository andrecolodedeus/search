<h1>Vincent Louis Gotti</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Bologna, 5 Sept., 1664; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 Sept., 1742. He received part of his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and at the age of sixteen entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>. He so excelled others in the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that his superiors sent him to Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, for the best possible training in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>. Having completed his studies with great success he returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1688, and was sent to Mantua to teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the order there. Hardly had he undertaken his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> when he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the master general to fill the chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the Minerva <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. Next he was ordered to establish a new course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Bologna, where in 1695 he was made public professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> by the senate of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1708 he was elected <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Bologna; re-elected in 1714; and, two years later, made superior of that entire province. In 1715 <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> appointed him general inquisitor of the Faith in the city of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Although most unwilling to receive this appointment, Gotti <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> discharged its arduous <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> for two years, when, after repeated requests, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> released him from the office. Returning to Bologna, he was given the chair of polemical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in 1720 was, for the third time, elected <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> there. On 30 April, 1728, <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a>, and appointed him <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He was then made a member of nine different congregations, to all of which he gave his unremitting attention. With his many <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, he never relaxed in the religious observances of his life, and found, moreover, ample time for much private study. He was present at the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> of <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>.

<p>Cardinal Gotti possessed an acuteness of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and a solidity of judgment altogether uncommon. A tireless student, he amassed a fund of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and acquired a facility of expression which placed him in the foremost ranks of the greatest minds of his time. Special tributes to his ability and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life were repeatedly paid by Popes <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> and <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">XII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">XIV</a>, by various members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, by Victor Amadeus II, and his son Emmanuel, and by the Princess Maria Clementine Sobieski.

<p>Among the best known works of Gotti are: (1) "La vera chiesa di G. Christo dimonstrata dai segni et dai dogmi contro i due libri di Giacomo Picenino" (4 vols., Bologna, 1719), translated into Latin with added notes by Vincent Thomas Covi, O.P., and published at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1734) and Bologna (1750); (2) "Concordia matrimonii cum ministro", which was published at Bologna in 1727 under the title, "Colloquia theologica polemica in tres classes distributa"; (3) "Theologia scholastico-dogmatica juxta mentem Divi Thomae Aquinatis" (Bologna, 1727-35), which filled eight volumes and was divided into sixteen parts: the first part comprises the prolegomena and loci theologici, and all the rest follow the order of the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa"</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, except the last part, which deals with the state of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after death, the end of the world, general judgment, etc.; this same work was again published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1750. (4) "Veritas religionis christianae et librorum, quibus innititur contra atheos, polytheos, idololatras, mohammedanos et judaeos demonstrata" (3 vols., Rome, 1735-36); (5) "Veritas religionis christianae ex genere, conceptu, ortu, gestis, mysteriis ac prodigiis Jesu Christi, necnon Virginis Deiparae confirmata" (4 vols., Rome, 1737); ". . .ex mirabili ejus propagatione per apostolos et eorum gesta comprobata" (5 vols., Rome, 1737); ". . .ex prodigiis eius inter paganorum persecutiones augmento et mirabili constantia martyrum" (6 vols., Rome, 1738); ". . .ex devictis haeresibus directe eius veritatem impugnantibus" (7 vols., Rome, 1738-40).
