<h1>Vincent de Valverde</h1>  

<p>Born at Oropesa, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> towards the close of the fifteenth century; d. at the Island of Pun&aacute;, near <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>, 31 Oct., 1541. He was the son of Francisco de Valverde and Ana Alvarez de Vallegada, and was related to many noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, in particular, to that of Pizarro, the conqueror of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and that of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a>, the conqueror of Mexico. Valverde became a professed member of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Esteban, Salamanca, April, 1524. In 1529 he accompanied Pizarro as a missionary, on his intended voyage of conquest to <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. Before the battle of Caxamarca, 16 Nov., 1532, Valverde endeavoured to obtain <a href="../cathen/02032a.htm">Atahuallpa's</a> peaceful submission; later he instructed and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the unfortunate Inca monarch. When <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> learned of Pizarro's victories, he named Valverde first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, the royal city of the <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> kings; <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> ratified his choice in a consistory held in January, 1537. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> found his spiritual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> arduous, for he had already been charged with the office of Protector of the Natives. This forced him to cross the rude soldiery constantly, as the adventurers who made up the Spanish armies had no thought of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or mercy to the Indians. He strove to settle the feud between Almagro and Pizarro and after the assassination of the latter was forced to flee from <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. Making his way to <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a>, he halted for a brief stay at the Island of Pun&aacute;, where he was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the Indians. The fame of Bishop Valverde depends on his conduct at Caxamarca. If the tradition be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> addressed <a href="../cathen/02032a.htm">Atahuallpa</a> with haughtiness and disdain, and when his words were not heeded called his compatriots to attack the unoffending <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvians</a>, then Valverde merits general condemnation. The great religious historians, however, such as Valera, Melendez, Remesal, deny the charge as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Xerez, an eye-witness, in his account (Seville, 1534) states that when the Inca refused to yield, Valverde returned and informed Pizarro, who then ordered his men to advance; he makes no mention of anything unworthy in the friar's conduct, nor does Pedro Pizarro, one of the earliest writers (his "Relacion" being <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1571). Particularly bitter to Valverde are Alonzo Enrique and Oviedo, who gives the account of Diego de Molilna, a soldier of the expedition, but both of these were partisans of Almagro. Later writers take differing views. The case is not proven either way. In consideration of the extraordinary completeness of the details of Valverde's actions, one must conclude that they are not authentic but the result of political or personal bias.
