<h1>Vineam Domini</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> on 16 July, 1705. It was occasioned by the following incident: A <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, ostensibly the confessor of a dying ecclesiastic, proposed seven questions to the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the Sorbonne for solution. The most prominent of these questions was the one whether <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> can be granted to an ecclesiastic who confessed that he rejects, in the sense of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the five propositions condemned by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> as <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a>; but, since it was not clear to the penitent that these propositions are actually contained in the "Augustinus" of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, he thought it sufficient to observe a "respectful silence" (<em>silence respectueux</em>) concerning this question of fact, and, with this restriction, signed the formula prescribed by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>. Forty <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, among them Ellies Du Pin, Petitpied, Bourret, Sarrasin, and Natalis Alexander, decided that <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> could not be withheld, since the case was neither new nor extraordinary, and since the penitent's opinion was not condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Though the decision was given secretly on 20 July, 1701, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> published the case in July, 1702, with the signatures of the forty <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the Sorbvonne: "Cas de conscience par un confesseur de Province . . . r&eacute;solu par plusieurs docteurs de la Facult&eacute; de Th&eacute;ologie de Paris Lettre de M. . . . Chanoine de B. &agrave; M. T. D. A." It is reprinted in Du Plessis, "Collection judiciorum", III (Paris, 1736), 413-7. As probable authors of the "Cas de conscience" are mentioned: Eustace, the confessor of Port-Royal (Ste-Beuve, "Port-Royal", VI, 169); Fr&eacute;hel, <em>cur&eacute;</em> of Notre-Dame-du- Port, at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (Le Roy, loc. cit. infra, 98); Du Pin (Guarnacci, "Vitae et res gestae pontif. E card.", II, cap. xi); Petitpied; Alquebille Perrier; and others. Whoever may have been its author, Roulland, a doctor or the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, edited it, and <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal Noailles</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of its existence before it was published, and is even said to have promised his own signature. Its appearance caused a great stir among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, for the solution of the case was equivalent to the revival of one phase of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, the opinion that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has not the power to decide on questions on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> fact, i.e. whether a certain book contains or does not contain <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The solution was condemned by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Cum nuper", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 February, 1703. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at the same time urged <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">King Louis XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Archbishop Noailles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to take energetic measures against all recalcitrants. Despite the banishment of five <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the Sorbonne who refused to submit, the controversy continued, and <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">King Louis XIV</a>, seconded by the Bourbon King Philip V of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, requested the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to issue a Constitution condemning the so-called respectful silence. Since <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> insisted that the Constitution should contain no expressions contrary to the Gallican Liberties, its issue was somewhat delayed and finally, after its contents had been communicated to the king, the Constitution "Vineam Domini Sabaoth" appeared at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 16 July, 1705.

<p>This Constitution begins with a confirmation of the three <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> &#151; "Cum occasione" (<a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>), "Ad Sacram", and "Regiminis Apostolici" (<a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>) &#151; that had been previously published against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, and contains their entire text. Then follows a defence of <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and misinterpretations of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. To this is added a severe rebuke of those who, by what they term respectful silence, pretend to obey the Apostolic Constitutions while in reality they deceive the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The Constitution ends with a solemn declaration that a respectful silence is by no means sufficient, <em>obsequioso illo silentio nequaquam satisfieri</em>, that all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to reject and condemn as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, not only with their mouth, but also with their heart, the sense which was condemned in the previously mentioned five propositions of the book of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, and which the words of the propositions naturally have. "Damnatum in quinque praefatis propositionibus Jansenii libri sensum, quem illarum verba prae se ferunt, ut praefertur, ab omnibus Christi fidelibus ut haereticum, non ore solum, sed et corde rejci ac damnari debere."

<p>The Constitution arrived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> while the Assembly of the French Clergy was in session. It was accepted by the Assembly on 21 August, not, however, until it had been decided to accompany the Constitution with the declaration that "the papal constitutions are binding on the whole Church when they have been accepted by the bishops", thus making it appear that the Constitution received its binding force by the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. On 31 August, the Constitution was made a state law. It was accepted by all the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with the exception of Percin de Montgaillard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saint-Pons, who published a <em>mandement</em> in defence of "respectful silence". The <em>mandement</em> was censured by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> on 18 January, 1710, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> finally submitted in a long letter to Clement on 28 February, 1713. The Sorbonne accepted the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> on 1 Sept., 1705. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Port-Royal refused to accept it, except with certain restrictions, and, in consequence, the king obtained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> permission to suppress their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. (See PORT ROYAL.)

<p>On 31 August, 1706, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> addressed a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> to <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal Noailles</a> and another to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, in which he scathingly reproved the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for "usurping the plenitude of power which God has given exclusively to the Chair of St. Peter", and demanded that they recant the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> declaration which they had appended to his Constitution "Vineam Domini". After various evasions <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal Noailles</a> was finally prevailed upon, as the president of the Assembly, to sign, on 29 June, 1711, a document drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in which it was expressly stated that the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give the papal constitutions their binding force.
