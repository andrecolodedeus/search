<h1>Virgin Birth of Christ</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> which teaches that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> before, during, and after the conception and birth of her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Son</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The Virgin Birth in Catholic theology</h2>
<h3>Councils and creeds</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of our <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Lady</a> was defined under <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> in the third canon of the <a href="../cathen/09016a.htm">Lateran Council</a> held in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Pope Martin I</a>, A.D. 649. The <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04479a.htm">recited in the Mass</a>, expresses <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "incarnate by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>"; the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> professes that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> "was conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>"; the older form of the same <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> uses the expression: "born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>". These professions show:

<ul><li>That the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was not sent down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, nor taken from earth as was that of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, but that its matter was supplied by <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>; <li>that <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> co-operated in the formation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body as every other mother co-operates in the formation of the body of her child, since otherwise Christ could not be said to be born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> just as <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> cannot be said to be born of Adam; <li>that the germ in whose development and growth into the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> co-operated, was fecundated not by any human action, but by the Divine power attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; <li>that the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> influence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> extended to the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, not merely preserving <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> integrity, but also causing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth or external generation to reflect his eternal birth from the Father in this, that "the Light from Light" proceeded from his mother's womb as a light shed on the world; that the "power of the Most High" passed through the barriers of nature without injuring them; that "the body of the Word" formed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> penetrated another body after the manner of spirits.</ul>
<h3>Church Fathers</h3>

<p>The perpetual virginity of our Blessed Lady was taught and proposed to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> not merely by the councils and creeds, but also by the early <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>. The words of the <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">prophet Isaias</a> (vii, 14) are understood in this sense by <ul> <li><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a> (III, 21; see <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.8</a>), <li><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Adv. Cels., I, 35), <li><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (Adv. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>., III, 13; Adv. Jud&aelig;os, IX), <li><a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> (<a href="../fathers/01286.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 84</a>), <li><a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (Hom. v in Matth., n. 3; in Isa., VII, n. 5); <li><a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (H&aelig;r., xxviii, n. 7), <li><a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Demonstrat. ev., VIII, i), <li><a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Rufinus</a> (Lib. fid., 43), <li><a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (in Isa., vii, 14; Hom. in S. Generat. Christi, n. 4, if St. Basil be the author of these two passages), <li><a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and Theodoretus (in Isa., vii, 14), <li><a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a> (Adv. Jud&aelig;os, I, x, n. 3), <li><a href="../cathen/07649b.htm">St. Ildefonsus</a> (De perpetua virginit. s. Mari&aelig;, iii). </ul>

<p><a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> devotes his entire treatise against Helvidius to the perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Blessed Lady</a> (see especially nos. 4, 13, 18).

<p>The contrary doctrine is called:

<ul> <li>"madness and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>" by <a href="../cathen/06416a.htm">Gennadius</a> (De dogm. eccl., lxix), <li>"madness" by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (in Luc., h, vii), <li>"sacrilege" by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (De instit. virg., V, xxxv), <li>"impiety and smacking of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>" by Philostorgius (VI, 2), <li>"perfidy" by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> (hom. v, and xxii), <li>"full of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>" by the author of Pr&aelig;destin. (i, 84), <li>"perfidy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>" by <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (ep. ix, 3), <li>"heresy" by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (De H&aelig;r. h., lvi). </ul>

<p><a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> probably excels all others in his invectives against the opponents of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> (H&aelig;r., lxxviii, 1, 11, 23).
<h3>Sacred Scripture</h3>

<p>There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching and as to the existence of an early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition maintaining the perpetual virginity of our Blessed Lady and consequently the virgin birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. The mystery of the virginal conception is furthermore taught by the <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">third Gospel</a> and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">first</a>. According to St. Luke (1:34-35), "Mary said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: How shall this be done, because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not man? And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answering, said to her: The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." The intercourse of man is excluded in the conception of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Blessed Lord</a>. According to St. Matthew, <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a>, when perplexed by the pregnancy of Mary, is told by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (1:20).
<h2 id="section2">Sources of this doctrine</h2>

<p>Whence did the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> derive their information? As far as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, only two created beings were witnesses of the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">annunciation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">angel</a> and the Blessed Virgin. Later on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> informed <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a> concerning the mystery. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether Elizabeth, though "filled with the Holy Ghost", learned the full <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> supernaturally, but we may suppose that Mary confided the secret both to her friend and her spouse, thus completing the partial revelation received by both.



<p>Between these data and the story of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> there is a gap which cannot be filled from any express clue furnished by either Scripture or tradition. If we compare the narrative of the first <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> with that of the third, we find that St. Matthew may have drawn his information from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a> independently of any information furnished by Mary. The first Gospel merely states (1:18): "When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." St. Joseph could supply these facts either from personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or from the words of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: "That which is conceived in her, is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." The narrative of St. Luke, on the other hand, must ultimately be traced back to the testimony of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Blessed Lady</a>, unless we are prepared to admit unnecessarily another independent revelation. The evangelist himself points to Mary as the source of his account of the infancy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when he says that Mary kept all these words in her heart (2:19, 51). Zahn [1] does not hesitate to say that Mary is pointed out by these expressions as the bearer of the traditions in Luke 1 and 2.

<p>A. How did St. Luke derive his account from the Blessed Virgin? It has been supposed by some that he received his information from Mary herself. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> he is at times called the "chaplain" of Mary [2]; J. Nirsch [3] calls St. Luke the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that he wrote the history of the infancy from her mouth and heart. Besides, there is the implied testimony of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>, who assures us twice that Mary had kept all these words in her heart. But this does not necessitate an immediate oral communication of the history of the infancy on the part of Mary; it merely shows that Mary is the ultimate source of the account. If St. Luke had received the history of the infancy from the Blessed Virgin by way of oral communication, its presentation in the third Gospel naturally would show the form and style of its Greek author. In point of fact the history of the infancy as found in the third Gospel (1:5 to 2:52) betrays in its contents, its language, and style a Jewish-Christian source. The whole passage reads like a chapter from the First Book of Machabees; Jewish customs, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and peculiarities are introduced without any further explanation; the <a href="../cathen/09534a.htm">"Magnificat"</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02473a.htm">"Benedictus"</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11159a.htm">"Nunc dimittis"</a> are filled with national Jewish <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. As to the style and language of the history of the infancy, both are so thoroughly <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> that the passage must be retranslated into Hebrew or Aramaic in order to be properly appreciated. We must conclude, then, that St. Luke's immediate source for the history of the infancy was not an oral, but a written one.

<p>B. It is hardly probable that Mary herself wrote the history of the infancy as was supposed by A. Plummer [4]; it is more credible that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> used a memoir written by a Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, possibly a convert Jewish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs7">Acts 6:7</a>), perhaps even a member or friend of Zachary's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> [5]. But, whatever may be the immediate source of St. Luke's account, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> knows that he has "diligently attained to all things from the beginning", according to the testimony of those "who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the word" (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs2">Luke 1:2</a>).

<p>As to the original language of St. Luke's source, we may agree with the judgment of Lagarde [6] that the first two chapters of St. Luke present a Hebrew rather than a Greek or an Aramaic colouring. Writers have not been wanting who have tried to prove that St. Luke's written source for his first two chapters was composed in Hebrew [7]. But these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> are not cogent; St. Luke's Hebraisms may have their origin in an Aramaic source, or even in a Greek original composed in the language of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. Still, considering the fact that Aramaic was the language commonly spoken in Palestine at that time, we must conclude that <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Blessed Lady's</a> secret was originally written in Aramaic, though it must have been translated into Greek before St. Luke utilized it [8]. As the Greek of Luke 2:41-52 is more idiomatic than the language of Luke 1:4-2:40, it has been inferred that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist's</a> written source reached only to 2:40; but as in 2:51, expressions are repeated which occur in 2:19, it may be safely inferred that both passages were taken from the same source.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> recast the source of the history of the infancy before incorporating it into his Gospel; for the use of words and expressions in Luke 1 and 2 agrees with the language in the following chapters [9]. Harnack [10] and Dalman [11] suggest that St. Luke may be the original author of his first two chapters, adopting the language and style of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>; but Vogel [12] and Zahn [13] maintain that such a literary feat would be impossible for a Greek-speaking writer. What has been said explains why it is quite impossible to reconstruct St. Luke's original source; the attempt of Resch [14] to reconstruct the original Gospel of the infancy or the source of the first two chapters of the first and third Gospel and the basis of the prologue to the fourth, is a failure, in spite of its ingenuity. Conrady [15] believed that he had found the common source of the canonical history of the infancy in the so-called "Protevangelium Jacobi", which, according to him, was written in Hebrew by an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> about A.D. 120, and was soon after translated into Greek; it should be kept in mind, however, that the Greek text is not a translation, but the original, and a mere compilation from the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. All we can say therefore, concerning St. Luke's source for his history of the infancy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is reduced to the scanty information that it must have been a Greek translation of an Aramaic document based, in the last instance, on the testimony of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Blessed Lady</a>.
<h2 id="section3">The Virgin Birth in modern theology</h2>

<p>Modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> adhering to the principle of historical development, and denying the possibility of any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous intervention</a> in the course of history, cannot consistently admit the historical actuality of the virgin birth. According to modern views, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was really the son of Joseph and Mary and was endowed by an admiring posterity with the halo of Divinity; the story of his virgin birth was in keeping with the myths concerning the extraordinary births of the heroes of other nations [16]; the original text of the Gospels <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of the virgin birth [17]. Without insisting on the arbitrariness of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> assumptions implied in the position of modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, we shall briefly review its critical attitude towards the text of the Gospels and its attempts to account for the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition concerning the virgin birth of Christ.
<h3 id="A">Integrity of the Gospel text</h3>

<p>Wellhausen [18] contended that the original text of the third Gospel began with our present third chapter, the first two chapters being a later addition. But Harnack seems to have foreseen this theory before it was proposed by Wellhausen; for he showed that the two chapters in question belonged to the author of the third Gospel and of the Acts [19]. Holtzmann [20] considers Luke 1:34-35 as a later addition; Hillmann [21] believes that the words <em>hos enouizeto</em> of Luke 3:23 ought to be considered in the same light. Weinel [22] believes that the removal of the words <em>epei andra ou ginosko</em> from Luke 1:34 leaves the third Gospel without a cogent <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for the virgin birth; Harnack not only agrees with the omissions of Holtzmann and Hillmann, but deletes also the word <em>parthenos</em> from Luke 1:27 [23]. Other friends of modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> are rather sceptical as to the solidity of these <a href="../cathen/04497a.htm">text-critical</a> theories; Hilgenfield [24], Clement [25], and Gunkel [26] reject Harnack's arguments without reserve. Bardenhewer [27] weighs them singly and finds them wanting.

<p>In the light of the arguments for the genuineness of the portions of the third Gospel rejected by the above named critics, it is hard to understand how they can be omitted by any unprejudiced student of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a>.

<ul> <li>They are found in all <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, translations, and early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> citations, in all printed editions &mdash; in brief, in all the documents considered by the critics as reliable witnesses for the genuineness of a text. <li>Furthermore, in the narrative of St. Luke, each verse is like a link in a chain, so that no verse can be removed as an interpolation without destroying the whole. <li>Moreover, verses 34 and 35 are in the Lucan history what the keystone is in an arch, what a diamond is in its setting; the text of the Gospel without these two verses resembles an unfinished arch, a setting bereft of its precious stones [28]. <li>Finally, the Lucan account left us by the critics is not in keeping with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist's</a> narrative. According to the critics, verses 26-33 and 36-38 relate the promise of the birth of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, the son of Joseph and Mary, just as the verses immediately preceding relate the promise of the birth of the precursor, the son of Zachary and Elizabeth. But there is a great difference: the precursor's story is filled with <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> &mdash; as Zachary's sudden dumbness, John's wonderful conception &mdash; while the account of <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Christ's conception</a> offers nothing extraordinary; in the one case the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is sent to the child's father, Zachary, while in the other the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appears to Mary; in the one case Elizabeth is said to have conceived "after those days", while there is nothing added about Mary's conception [29]. The complete traditional text of the Gospel explains these differences, but the critically mutilated text leaves them inexplicable. </ul>

<p>The friends of modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at first believed that they possessed a solid foundation for denying the virgin birth in the Codex Syrus Sinaiticus discovered by Mrs. Lewis and Mrs. Gibson in 1892, more accurately investigated in 1893, published in 1894, and supplemented in 1896. According to this codex, <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#vrs16">Matthew 1:16</a> reads: "Joseph to whom was espoused Mary the Virgin, begot <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who is called Christ." Still, the Syriac translator cannot have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the virgin birth. Why did he leave the expression "the virgin" in the immediate context? How did he understand verses 18, 20, and 25, if he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything of the virgin birth? Hence, either the Syriac text has been slightly altered by a transcriber (only one letter had to be changed) or the translator understood the word <em>begot</em> of conventional, not of carnal, fatherhood, a meaning it has in verses 8 and 12.
<h3 id="B">Non-historical source of the Virgin Birth</h3>

<p>The opponents of the historical actuality of the virgin birth grant that either the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> or the interpolators of the Gospels borrowed their material from an early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition, but they endeavour to show that this tradition has no solid historical foundation. About A.D. 153 <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> (<a href="../fathers/0126.htm#chapter21"><em>First Apology</em> 21</a>) told his <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> readers that the virgin birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> ought not to seem incredible to them, since many of the most esteemed <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> writers spoke of a number of sons of Zeus. About A.D. 178 the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a> ridiculed the virgin birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, comparing it with the Greek myths of Danae, Melanippe, and Antiope; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (c. Cels. I, xxxvii) answered that <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a> wrote more like a buffoon than a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. But modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> again derive the virgin birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> from unhistorical sources, though their theories do not agree.

<p><em>The Pagan Origin Theory</em>

<p>A first class of writers have recourse to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology in order to account for the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition concerning the virgin birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Usener [30] argues that the early <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> must have attributed to Christ what their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> ancestors had attributed to their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> heroes; hence the Divine sonship of Christ is a product of the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Hillmann [31] and Holtzmann [32] agree substantially with Usener's theory. Conrady [33] found in the Virgin Mary a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> imitation of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> goddess Isis, the mother of Horus; but Holtzmann [34] declares that he cannot follow this "daring construction without a feeling of fear and dizziness", and Usener [35] is afraid that his friend Conrady moves on a precipitous track. Soltau [36] tries to transfer the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> origin of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but Lobstein [37] fears that Soltau's attempt may throw discredit on <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> itself, and Kreyher [38] refutes the theory more at length.

<p>In general, the derivation of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> birth from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology through the medium of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> implies several inexplicable difficulties:

<ul> <li>Why should the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> recently <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> revert to his <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> in his conception of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrines</a>? <li>How could the product of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> thought find its way among Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> without leaving as much as a vestige of opposition on the part of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? <li>How could this importation into Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> be effected at an age early enough to produce the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sources from which either the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> or the interpolators of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> derived their material? <li>Why did not the relatives of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> protest against the novel views concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> origin? </ul>

<p>Besides, the very argument on which rests the importation of the virgin birth from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> myths into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is fallacious, to say the least. Its major premise assumes that similar phenomena not merely may, but must, spring from similar causes; its minor premise contends that Christ's virgin birth and the mythical divine sonships of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world are similar phenomena, a contention <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> on the face of it.

<p><em>The Jewish Origin Theory (Isaiah 7:14)</em>

<p>A second class of writers derive the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition of the virgin birth from Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> influence. Harnack [39] is of the opinion that the virgin birth originated from <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#vrs14">Isaiah 7:14</a>; Lobstein [40] adds the "poetic traditions surrounding the cradle of Isaac, Samson, and Samuel" as another source of the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the virgin birth. Modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> does not grant that <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#vrs14">Isaiah 7:14</a>, contains a real prophecy fulfilled in the virgin birth of Christ; it must maintain, therefore, that St. Matthew misunderstood the passage when he said: "Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying; Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son," etc. (1:22-23). How do Harnack and Lobstein explain such a misunderstanding on the part of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>? There is no indication that the Jewish contemporaries of St. Matthew understood the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words in this sense. Hillmann [41] proves that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the virgin birth is not contained in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and therefore cannot have been taken from it. Dalman [42] maintains that the Jewish people never expected a fatherless birth of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, and that there exists no vestige of such a Jewish interpretation of <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#vrs14">Isaiah 7:14</a>.

<p>Those who derive the virgin birth from <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#vrs14">Isaiah 7:14</a>, must maintain that an accidental misinterpretation of the Prophet by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> replaced historic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> among the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in spite of the better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">kindred</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Zahn [43] calls such a supposition "altogether fantastic"; Usener [44] pronounce the attempt to make <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#vrs14">Isaiah 7:14</a> the origin of the virgin birth, instead of its seal, an inversion of the natural order. Though <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> endeavours to find in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> prophetic indications of the virgin birth, still it grants that the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> arrived at the full meaning of <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#vrs14">Isaiah 7:14</a>, only through its accomplishment [45].

<p><em>The Syncretic Theory</em>

<p>There is a third theory which endeavours to account for the prevalence of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the virgin birth among the early Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Gunkel [46] grants that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of virgin birth is a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, wholly foreign to the Jewish conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but he also grants that this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> could not have found its way into early Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> through <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> influence. Hence he believes that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> had found its way among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in pre-Christian times, so that the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> which flowed directly into early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had undergone a certain amount of <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a>. Hilgenfeld [47] tries to derive the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching of the virgin birth neither from classical <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> nor from pure <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, but from the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essene</a> depreciation of marriage. The theories of both Gunkel and Hilgenfeld are based on airy combinations rather than historical evidence. Neither writer produces any historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for his assertions. Gunkel, indeed, incidentally draws attention to <a href="../cathen/11508b.htm">Parsee</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a> legend, and to Roman and Greek fables. But the Romans and Greeks did not exert such a notable influence on pre-Christian <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>; and that the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a> legend reached as far as Palestine cannot be seriously maintained by Gunkel [48]. Even Harnack [49] regards the theory that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of virgin birth penetrated among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> through <a href="../cathen/11508b.htm">Parsee</a> influence, as an unprovable assumption.
