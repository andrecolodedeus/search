<h1>Virgin of Cuyo</h1>  

<p>(At Mendoza, <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine Republic</a>).

<p>Historians tell us that the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Virgin of Cuyo, styled Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Cuyo or Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Carmen de Mendoza, was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> from the times of the earliest Spanish settlers. Though it origin is uncertain, its antiquity admits of no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. According to V. Gambon this <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> is probably the one which, together with the church in which it stood, was given to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> when the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were expelled (1767) from the country by Charles III. In 1864 the church was ruined by an earthquake, and in its place the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> erected the new church where the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> is now <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>.

<p>The celebrity of the shrine has resulted more from national gratitude for one great favour than for the countless <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> connected with it. Jos&eacute; de San Martin (1778-1850), to whom more than to any other single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the South American republics owe their independence, had great devotion to Our Lady of Cuyo. After confronting <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, San Martin returned to his native country at the outbreak of the War of Independence to organize the forces of his country. Well fitted to command, and possessing the full confidence of his countrymen, he soon gathered about him a little army, which he led to invariable success in battle, until his good fortune was checked by the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. Withdrawing to the Province of Cuyo (the territory which now includes the three Provinces of San Luis, <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a>, and Mendoza), San Martin soon strengthened his forces previous to his invasion of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>. Before crossing the Andes he ordered the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Our Lady of Cuyo to be brought from the church and placed in a conspicuous position. As his troops passed in review before the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, every man jubilantly proclaiming <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> as his especial patron in the campaign, San Martin, confident of victory, led his army across the Andes; the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> gave way before him. The inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a> flocked to his standard, and with colors flying followed their liberator into the capital, Santiago. The famous victories of Chacabuco, 12 Feb., 1817, and of Mayp&uacute;, 5 Apr., 1818, followed. From the scene of his victories, San Martin sent his commander's staff, the insignia of his position, as a votive offering of thanksgiving to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>; and to the superior of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> there he addressed the following letter under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 12 Aug., 1812 [sic, i.e., 1818]: <blockquote> The remarkable protection granted to the Army of the Andes by its Patron and General, Our Lady of Cuyo, cannot fail to be observed. I am <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to acknowledge the favour and to present to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in your Reverence's church, my staff of command which I hereby send: for it belongs to her and may it be a testimony of her protection to our Army. </blockquote>

<p>Three years later San Martin, accompanied by <a href="../cathen/11225c.htm">Bernardo O'Higgins</a>, marched into <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, entered <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, drove the resisting <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> into the interior, and declared <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> independent. San Martin died in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but his body was brought back to the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine Republic</a> and placed in a mausoleum in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>. His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Our Lady of Cuyo has made the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> famous throughout the country. At the suggestion of Leonardo M. Maldonado, O.S.F., the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentinos</a> asked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> permission to crown the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> readily gave his consent, and, in accordance with the pontifical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 21 Dec., 1910, the solemn <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> took place 8 Sept., 1911. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was attended by the most eminent men of the country. The crown of gold is said to be worth more than $75,000.
