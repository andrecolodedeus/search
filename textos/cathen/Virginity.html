<h1>Virginity</h1>  

<p>Morally, virginity signifies the reverence for bodily integrity which is suggested by a virtuous motive. Thus understood, it is common to both sexes, and may exist in a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> even after bodily violation committed upon her against her will. Physically, it implies a bodily integrity, visible evidence of which exists only in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> teaches us that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> preserved this bodily integrity, in the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, even during and after her childbirth (see <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, "Cum quorundam", 7 August, 1555). There are two elements in virginity: the material element, that is to say, the absence, in the past and in the present, of all complete and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> delectation, whether from <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> or from the lawful use of marriage; and the formal element, that is the firm resolution to abstain forever from sexual pleasure. It is to be remarked, on the one hand, that material virginity is not destroyed by every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the sixth or ninth commandment, and on the other hand that the resolution of virginity extends to more than the mere preservation of bodily integrity, for if it were restricted to material virginity, the resolution, at least outside the married state, might coexist with vicious desires, and could not then be virtuous.

<p>It has been sometimes asked whether there is a special virtue of virginity; and in spite of the affirmative answer of some authors, and of the text of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/3152.htm#article3">II-II:152:3</a>, the statement of which cannot be taken literally, the question must be answered in the negative. Formally, virginity is but the purpose of perpetually preserving perfect chastity in one who abstains from sexual pleasure. Ordinarily this purpose is inspired by a virtue superior to that of chastity; the motive may be religious or apostolic. Then the superior virtues of charity or religion will ennoble this purpose and communicate to it their own beauty; but we shall not find in it any splendour or merit of another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The resolution of virginity is generally offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> under the form of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. The counsel of virginity is expressly given in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; first in <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs11">Matthew 19:11-12</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, after reminding His disciples that besides those who are unfit for marriage by nature, or by reason of a mutilation inflicted by others, there are others who have made the same sacrifice for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, recommends them to imitate these. "He that can take, let him take it." Tradition has always understood this text in the sense of a profession of perpetual continence. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> again, speaking (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs25">1 Corinthians 7:25-40</a>) as a faithful preacher of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Lord (tamquam misericordiam consecutus a Domino, ut sim fidelis), formally declares that marriage is permissible, but that it would be better to follow his counsel and remain single; and he gives the reasons; besides the considerations arising from the circumstances of his time, he gives this general reason, that the married man "is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided"; whereas he that is without a wife directs all his care to his own bodily and spiritual sanctification, and is at liberty to devote himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, following this teaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, has always considered the state of virginity or <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> preferable in itself to the state of marriage, and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, Can. 10) pronounces an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against the opposite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of the sixteenth century understood <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words, "for the kingdom of heaven", in the text above quoted from St. Matthew, as applying to the preaching of the Gospel; but the context, especially verse 14, in which <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">"the kingdom of heaven"</a> clearly means eternal life, and the passage quoted from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> sufficiently refute that interpretation. Reason confirms the teaching of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The state of virginity means a signal victory over the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetites</a>, and an emancipation from worldly and earthly cares, which gives a man liberty to devote himself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Although a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is a virgin may fail to correspond to the sublime <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of his or her state, and may be inferior in merit to a married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, yet experience bears witness to the marvellous spiritual fruit produced by the example of those men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who emulate the purity of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.

<p>This perfect integrity of body, enhanced by a purpose of perpetual chastity, produces a special likeness to Christ, and creates a title to one of the three "aureol&aelig;", which <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> mention. According to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/5096.htm#article0">Supplement, 96</a>) these "aureol&aelig;" are particular rewards added to the essential <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and are like so many laurel wreaths, crowning three conspicuous victories, and three special points of resemblance to Christ: the victory over the flesh in virginity, the victory over the world in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and the victory over the devil in the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The text of St. John (<a href="../bible/rev014.htm#vrs1">Revelation 14:1-5</a>) is often understood of virgins, and the canticle which they alone may sing before the throne denotes the "aureola" which is given to them alone. It is most probable that the words in the fourth verse, "These are they who were not defiled with women: for they are virgins", are really spoken of virgins, though there are also other interpretations; perhaps, those who "were purchased from among men, the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the Lamb: And in their mouth there was found no lie: (loc. cit., 4, 5) are the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; they are declared to be without spot, as in an earlier chapter (vii, 14); they are said to "have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb".

<p>In the article <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">NUNS</a> it is shown how <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgins have been one of the glories of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> since the first ages, and how very ancient is the profession of virginity. Under <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">RELIGIOUS LIFE</a> is treated the difficulty of proving the strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of perseverance before the fifth century, when we meet with the letter of <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a> (404) to Vitricius (chapters xiii, xiv; cf. P.L., XX, 478 sqq.). Even at an earlier period still, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presided at the clothing, and the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of virgins became a sacramental rite, in which the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and benedictions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were added to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and merits of those who presented themselves, in order to obtain for them the grace of fidelity in their sublime profession. In the fourth century no age was fixed for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; virgins offered themselves quite young, at ten or twelve years of age. As there were children offered by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to the monastic life, so also there were children vowed to virginity before their birth, or very shortly after. Subsequently the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was passed which forbade <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> before the age of twenty-five years.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> prescribed in the Roman Pontifical is very solemn, and follows, step by step, that of an <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. It is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and can never be repeated. The days fixed for the solemnity were at first the Epiphany, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> week, and the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The third Council of the Lateran gave permission to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> virgins on all <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, and custom sometimes extended the permission (C. Subdiaconos, 1, De temp. ordinat., 1, 10). The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> takes place during Mass; the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> certifies the worthiness of the candidates, as he does that of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. After the introductory <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, the pontiff first asks them all together if they are resolved to persevere in their purpose of holy virginity; they answer: "Volumus" (we are). Then he asks each on severally: "Dost thou promise to preserve perpetual virginity"? and when she answers, "I do promise", the pontiff says, <a href="../cathen/04737a.htm">"Deo gratias"</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">litany of the saints</a> is then sung, with a double invocation on behalf of the virgins present: "Ut pr&aelig;sentes ancillas benedicere ... sanctificare digneris" ("That though wouldst vouchsafe to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and sanctify thy handmaidens here present"). It is to be remarked that the third invocation, "et consecrare digneris" ("That Thou wouldst vouchsafe to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> them"), which is added for major orders, is omitted here. The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Veni Creator" follows, after which the pontiff <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the habits, which the virgins put on. He then <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the veil, the ring, and the crown. After the singing of a very beautiful preface, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives three articles to the virgins with the formul&aelig; used in ordinations, and the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> ends with a benediction, some <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and a long <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> directed against any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who attempt to seduce the virgins from their holy profession. Sometimes after the Mass, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gave them, as also to the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, the Book of Hours, to recite the Office.

<p>From the fourth century the virgins wore a modest dress of dark colour; they were required to devote themselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>), manual labour, and an ascetic life. After the eighth century, as enclosure became the general law for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the reason for this special <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, already protected by the walls of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and by their <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, ceased to exist. Secret faults committed before or even after admission to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> led to questions which were very delicate to decide, and which became the subject of controversy. Was one who had lost her virginity to make the fact known at the price of her reputation? Was it enough to present herself as a virgin in order to be able to receive <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>? (See for example "Theol. moralis Salmaticensium", Q. xvi de 6 et 9 pr&aelig;cepto, i, n. 75; or <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a>, De justitia", etc., IV, ii, dub. 16.) The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> became more and more rare, though examples were found still in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; but it was not practiced in the Mendicant orders. <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">Saint Antoninus</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it in the fifteenth century; while <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> in vain tried to revive it in the sixteenth. The <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> alone received and still receives a solemn benediction.

<p>Virginity is irreparably lost by sexual pleasure, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> and completely experienced. "I tell you without hesitation", writes <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in his twenty-second Epistle to St. Eustochium, n. 5 (P.L., XXII, 397) "that though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">almighty</a>, He cannot restore a virginity that has been lost." A failure in the resolution, or even incomplete faults, leave room for efficacious repentance, which restores virtue and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the aureola. Formerly virginity was required as a condition for entrance into some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; at the present day, in most congregations, a pontifical <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the reception of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have been married (the Order of the Visitation however is formally open to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>); but bodily integrity is no longer required. If the candidate's reputation is intact, the doors of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are open to a generous repentance as to a generous innocence. (See <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">NUNS</a>; <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">RELIGIOUS LIFE</a>; <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">VOWS</a>; <a href="../cathen/15321c.htm">RELIGIOUS VEIL</a>.)
