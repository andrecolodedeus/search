<h1>Visigoths</h1>  

<p>One of the two principal branches of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>. Until 375 their history is combined with that of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>. <a href="../cathen/15120c.htm">Ulfilas (Wulfila)</a> laboured among the Visigoths, translated the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> into their language, and preached <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> with great success until prince Athanaric <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to withdraw (348). At the invasion of the Huns some of the Visigoths fled with Athanaric into the mountains of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, but the majority of the people turned to the <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Emperor Valens</a> with the entreaty to be taken into the Roman Empire. In 376 a force of 200,000 Visigoths crossed the Danube, but oppression by the governors led to a revolt. They traversed the country plundering as they went, and, and defeated <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> in 378 near Adrianople. <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> was slain and his successor, <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, made peace with the Visigoths in 382. His policy was to unite them with the empire by means of national commanders appointed by the emperor. Desirous of maintaining peace, he endeavoured to unite the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> with those who held the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> (395) the Visigoths elected Alaric of the Baltha <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as their king. Alaric sought to establish a Germanic kingdom on Roman soil by bringing his people into connection with Roman civilization. In 396 he invaded the Balkan peninsula as far as the Peloponnesus and was given the Province of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>. He now turned against the Western Empire, and in 401 entered <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He was victorious at <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> but after the battle of Pollentia (403) was forced to retreat. In 408 he demanded the cession of Noricum, <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> Pannonia, and Venetia, in 410 he plundered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and soon after died in southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His successor Athaulf (410-15) led the Visigoths into Gaul, where the following king Wallia (415-19) gained the land between the Garonne and the Loire. Under the succeeding rulers the kingdom was enlarged, and, during the reign of Euric (466) the Visigothic Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, named after its capital <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, included the southern part of Gaul and a large portion of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> kings found the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> firmly established in the country; and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> enjoyed toleration until the reign of Euric. The conflicts which then arose have been described by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> as bloody persecutions, but this is exaggerated. Euric was in general just towards his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects but took steps against individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who encouraged religious quarrels and were political opponents of the kingdom. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who fled from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> found an asylum among the Visigoths and Euric's minister, Leo, was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">King Clovis</a> and his <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> followers accepted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> undertook to drive the "heretics" out of Gaul. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> made common cause with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and Alaric II (485-507) took severe measures against them, but was not otherwise a persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 507 Alaric was defeated and slain by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>. Almost all of Visigothic Gaul now fell to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, the last remnant during the reign of Amalaric (526-31). The seat of government was transferred to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> where Toledo became the capital.

<p>The ensuing era was fairly peaceful. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> received unlimited tolerance, so that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> constantly increased in strength while the Visigothic nation and kingdom grew steadily weaker. The nobility <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> and deposed kings at pleasure; of thirty-five kings, seventeen were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> or deposed. <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, isolated after the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> and <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandalic</a> kingdoms, constantly declined but was revived during the reign of Leovigild (568-86) His son Hermenigild revolted against him but was defeated and beheaded. Later narratives represent Hermenigild as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, his wife, a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> princess, having converted him, but contemporary authorities say nothing of it. Leovigild made a vain effort to win the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by a conciliatory confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> drawn up by an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> synod at Toledo. His son Reccared (586-601) <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the Visigoths soon followed his example. With this began the amalgamation of Roman and German elements in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In law and politics the Romans became Gothic; the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> in social life and religion became Roman. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was the national and established Church, while connection with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> ceased almost entirely. The court of highest instance was the national council at Toledo. The king appointed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and convoked the council. But the constant struggles of the royal house with the secular and spiritual aristocracy caused the downfall of the nation. From the middle of the seventh century the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> were masters of North Africa. In 711 they forced their way into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> under Tarik. King Roderick was defeated at Jerez de la Frontera, and the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> acquired almost the whole of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The Romans and <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> coalesced, forming the Spanish nation which succeeded later in driving the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> out of the peninsula.
