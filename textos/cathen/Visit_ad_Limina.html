<h1>Visit ad Limina</h1>  

<p>(Sc. <em>Apostolorum</em>)

<p>The visit <em>ad limina</em> means, technically, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> incumbent on certain members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of visiting, at stated times, the "thresholds of the Apostles", Sts. Peter and Paul, and of presenting themselves before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to give an account of the state of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The object of the visit is not merely to make a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the apostles, but, above all, to show the proper reverence for the Successor of St. Peter, to acknowledge practically his universal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by giving an account of the condition of particular churches, to receive his admonitions and counsels, and thus bind more closely the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to its Divinely appointed head.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>Although it was the custom of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the most remote times to refer causes to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and even to visit him personally when circumstances required it, yet we can find no trace in the earliest age of any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> binding them to repair to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at stated times. The first vestiges of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> are found in the ancient practice of celebrating twice a year provincial councils of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> who pertained to the province of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. In the fifth century, <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> insists on the custom of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> sending three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> yearly to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist at a council. In the next century, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> declared that although in his time the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> only once every three years, yet he extends the term to five years. A Roman council under <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> (A.D. 743) decreed that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who reside near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, should make the visit <em>ad limina</em> yearly in person, and those who are far away should fulfil the same <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> by letter (can. IV). A custom gradually arose which, at least from the eleventh century, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> when asking for the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and, soon after, all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to visit the thresholds of the apostles at stated times, either personally or by a substitute. That this visit was of strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> can be gathered from the expressions of Paschal II (cap. iv, x, De elect., I, 6), and especially of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in many <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>, while in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, a form of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is given (cap, iv, x, De jurejurand., II, 24), in which <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> before their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to promise that they will visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> annually, either personally or by deputy, unless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> dispenses them.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>In 1585 <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> issued the Constitution "Romanus Pontifex", which for over three hundred years formed the main rule and norm for visits <em>ad limina</em>. This document states in detail within what term of years, each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, from whatever part of the world, should visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and what heads of information he should consider in making his report to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (23 Nov. 1740) in the Constitution "Quod Sancta", extended the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> <em>nullius</em> ruling over a separate territory. This <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also established a particular congregation <em>super statu ecclesiarum</em> to deal with the reports of Bishops when they made the prescribed visit.
<h2 id="section2">II</h2>

<p>The present discipline concerning visits <em>ad limina</em> is found in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Consistorial Congregation, issued by order of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (31 Dec., 1909) for all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> not subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> states that every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must render to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> an account of the state of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> once every five years. The quinquennial periods are to begin in 1911. In the first year of that term, the report is to be sent in by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and of the islands of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and Malta; in the second year, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; in the third year, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> and German Empires and of the remainder of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; in the fourth year, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of all America; in the fifth year, by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and the adjacent islands. In their first report, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are directed to answer every question in a subjoined <em>elenchus</em>, but in subsequent relations they are merely to add anything new, if such there be, and state the result of the counsels and admonitions given by the Sacred Congregation in its reply to the report. Bishops, when they come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in fulfilment of their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <em>ad limina</em>, must visit the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the apostles and present themselves before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Ordinaries who reside outside of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to visit the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> once every alternate five years, or only decennially. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may satisfy this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, either personally or by his coadjutor or <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, or even, with permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> declares that this visit and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> report to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> are not to take the place of the <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which must be made annually, or, in large <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, biennially.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>To this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Consistorial Congregation is added an <em>elenchus</em> containing the points of information to be supplied by the ordinaries in their relation to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It may be briefly summarized as follows: The name, age, and fatherland of the ordinary; his <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, if he belongs to one; when he began to rule his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; and if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, when he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. A general statement concerning the religious and moral condition of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and whether religion progressed or lost ground in it since the last quinquennium. The origin of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, its hierarchical grade and principal privileges, and if <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a>, the number and names of the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, but if <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, what <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> synod its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> must attend; the extent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, its civil government, its climate, its language; the place of residence of the ordinary, with all directions <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for safe epistolary correspondence; the number of inhabitants and the principal cities; how many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there are, and if different rites prevail, how many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> belong to each; if there are non- <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, into what <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> they are divided; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> curia; the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the synodial judges and examiners, the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> and its officials, the archives, the various chancery taxes; the number of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, their dress, their mode of life and how they attend to their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>; whether there are any, and if so what, chapters of canons, and other aggregations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that form quasi-chapters; how many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> there are and the number of faithful in the largest and smallest; into how many vicariates forane or rural deaneries <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are grouped; how many non-parochial churches and public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> there are; whether there is any celebrated sacred shrine and if so, what; concerning the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, exhortations to <a href="../cathen/06278a.htm">frequent communion</a>, special devotions, missions, sodalities, and social works; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, its buildings, government, instruction in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and liturgy, the admission and dismissal of seminarians; the inter-diocesan <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, if there is one, and its condition; what institutes of religious men there are, with the number of houses and of religious, both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and lay-brothers; what special work these religious dedicate themselves to and their relations to the ordinary; what are the institutes of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with the number of houses and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; concerning the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, their work and the observance of canonical prescriptions; the instruction and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth; and the editing and reading of books and periodicals.
