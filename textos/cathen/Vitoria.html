<h1>Vitoria</h1>  

<p>(VICTORIENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, bounded on the north by the Bay of Biscay; on the east by Guipuzcoa and <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>; on the south by Logrono; and on the west by Burgo. It comprises the Basque Provinces and the greater part of the Province of Alava.

<p>The principal city, Vitoria, has more than 27,000 inhabitants. Prior to the tenth century the city was called <em>Gazteiz</em>, a Basque word meaning "the height of the fray", and belonged to the very ancient Federation of Arriaga, a federation of the towns of Alava. It occupied the upper portion of the present city, which is called el Campillo, or Villa de Suso. The name Gazteiz is found in a document of the Conde Fernan Gonzalez, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 934, preserved in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Millan de Rioja. The Navarrese king D. Sancho the Wise took possession of this region in 1181, giving it the name of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, which has been converted into Vitoria by the peculiarities of the local phonetics, and conferred upon it the privileges of a town. He built two castles, surrounded the town with walls, appointed Pedro Ramirez its military chief, and granted it the fuero, or charter, of Logrono. Alfonso VIII conquered it for Castile and conferred upon it still further fueros and privileges, which were confirmed by Ferdinand III and Alfonso X the Wise. John II conferred a city charter upon it on 20 November, 1431. <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella the Catholic</a> obtained from <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a> the transfer of the collegiate Church of Armentia to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> de Vitoria, the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and in 1862 the Diocese of Vitoria was erected, in conformity with the Concordat of 1851, under the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 5 October, 1861.

<p>When Calahorra was conquered by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Armentia, and the kings of Asturias then gave it the name of Diocese of Alava. Theodomir, Reccared, and Vivere (eighth and ninth centuries) signed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Calahorra, although they resided in Armentia. Bishop Fortunius was one of those who defended the use of the <a href="../cathen/10611a.htm">Mozarabic Rite</a> before <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>, and at his death (1088) the Diocese of Alava was suppressed, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Andres de Armentia taking rank simply as a collegiate with canons and dignitaries, the Archdean of Alava being the principal. This was transferred to Vitoria in 1498. In the fifteenth century Vitoria was disturbed by the factions of the <em>Callejas</em> (Aristocrats) and the <em>Agalas</em> (Democrats); the former held their meetings in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Pedro, and the later in that of San Miguel. Ferdinand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> made strenuous efforts to restore peace.

<p>The three distinct periods of its existence can easily be traced in the city of Vitoria. The most ancient city, the <em>Campillo</em>, or <em>Villa de Suso</em>, surrounded by walls and ramparts, now for the most part in ruins; the old city, built at the foot of the Villa de Suso and now shut in by the modern Vitoria with its handsome edifices. The Cathedral of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a>, the ancient collegiate church, which in 1181 was a fortress as well as a church, was situated in the old city. It disappeared when the fourteenth-century edifice was built. This is a Gothic structure of the second period; its beautiful open portico is surmounted by a clock tower; it has three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>; the main <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> (<em>capilla mayor</em>) has a beautiful tabernacle, the work of Olaguibel, and reredos by Valdivieso, both natives of Alava. In the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> is the "Immaculate Conception" by <a href="../cathen/03377b.htm">Juan de Carre&ntilde;o</a>, a "Pieta" attributed to <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>, and some small pictures by <a href="../cathen/15770a.htm">Zurbaran</a> and Juan de Juanes. The <a href="../cathen/12448a.htm">processional cross</a> is attributed to Benvenuto Cellini. The image of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, called <em>de la esclavitud</em>, because she holds an <em>S</em> and a nail (<em>clavo</em>) in her hand, is a precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the twelfth century. A new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which will be larger than that of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, is now (1912) being built through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, D. Jos&eacute; Cadena y Eleta. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> was opened in 1911. Other notable churches of Vitoria are San Vicente and San Miguel, which were the churches of Gazteiz in the time of Sancho the Wise. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Miguel is built on the site of an ancient Roman temple and contains a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> called La Blanca, from the whiteness of the stone of which it is made. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of San Pedro contains some curious <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> was founded by <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> on the site of the house of Sancho the Strong of Navarre. It has since served for a barracks and a military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, founded in 1214, is also a barracks for infantry and cavalry. Adrian of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> was living in the famous "Casa del Cordon" when he received the news of his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was inaugurated in 1880 under the patronage of St. Prudentius and St. Ignatius. It was enlarged by Bishop Mariano de Miguel y Gomez. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Aguirre was founded in 1853. During the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> it was used for a military storehouse. The secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has a guild building surrounded by the gardens of La Florida. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> occupies the old <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> building of San Prudencio which was founded in the seventeenth century by Bishop Salvatierra of <a href="../cathen/13684a.htm">Segorbe</a> and Ciudad-Rodrigo, a native of Vitoria. Onate is situated in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> dates from about the middle of the sixteenth century, having been founded by Rodrigo de Mercado y Zuazola, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Majorca and <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, in 1540, issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> to establish a collegio mayor and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> under the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. During the first civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> this institution was transferred to Vitoria, and then suppressed. Some years later it was reopened as an independent institution, but was afterwards again closed. D. Carlos de Borb&oacute;n gave his protection to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> when he was in power in the Basque Provinces during the last Carlist <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The Loyola House, which formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Diocese of Pamplona</a>, now belongs to Vitoria.
