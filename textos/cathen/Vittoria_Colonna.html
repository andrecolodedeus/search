<h1>Vittoria Colonna</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> poet, born at Marino, 1490; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, February 25, 1547. She was the daughter of Fabrizio Colonna, lord of various Roman fiefs and grand constable of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. Her mother, Agnese da Montefeltro, was a daughter of Federigo da Montefeltro, first Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. In 1509 Vittoria was married to Ferrante Francesco d'Avalos, Marquis of Pescara, a <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> nobleman of Spanish origin, who was one of the chief generals of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>. Pescara's military career culminated in the victory of Pavia (24 February, 1525), after which he became involved in Morone's conspiracy for the liberation of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was tempted from his allegiance to the emperor by the offer of the crown of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. Vittoria earnestly dissuaded him from this scheme, declaring (as her cousin, Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, tells us) that she "preferred to die the wife of a most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> marquis and a most upright general, than to live the consort of a king dishonoured with any stain of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>". Pescara died in the following November, leaving his young heir and cousin, Alfonso d'Avalos, Marchese del Vasto, under Vittoria's care.

<p>Vittoria henceforth devoted herself entirely to religion and literature. We find her usually in various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, and elsewhere, living in conventual simplicity, the centre of all that was noblest in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and spiritual life of the times. She had a peculiar genius for friendship, and the wonderful spiritual tie that united her to <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo Buonarroti</a> made the romance of that great artist's life. <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Pietro Bembo</a>, the literary dictator of the age, was among her most fervent admirers. She was closely in touch with <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a>, <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Contarini</a>, Giovanni Morone, and all that group of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who were working for the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">reformation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from within. For a while she had been drawn into the controversy concerning <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but was kept within the limits of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> by the influence of the beloved friend of her last years, <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Reginald Pole</a>, to whom she declared she owed her <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Her last wish was to be buried among the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of S. Anna de' Funari at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether her body ultimately rested there, or was removed to the side of her husband at San Domenico in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>.

<p>Vittoria is undoubtedly greater as a <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> than as a poet. Her earlier "Rime", which are mainly devoted to the glorification of her husband, are somewhat monotonous. Her later sonnets are almost exclusively religious, and strike a deeper note. A longer poem in terza-rima, the "Trionfo di Cristo" shows the influence of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> and <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a>, as well as that of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>. Her latest and best biographer, Mrs. Jerrold, to whom we are indebted for a number of beautiful and faithful translations of Vittoria's poetry, has drawn a suggestive analogy between it and the work of Christina Rossetti. Many of Vittoria's letters, and a prose meditation upon the Passion of Christ, have also been preserved.
