<h1>Vivarini</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>.
<h2>Alvise Vivarini</h2>

<p>Born in 1446 or 1447; died in 1502. He was the son of Antonio, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by his uncle Bartolomeo. Of his early history very little is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. In 1488 he wrote to the Signoria in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, begging that he might be allowed to prove his skill side by side with that of the two Bellini in the decoration of one of the great rooms, that in which the Grand Council met. His petition was granted, but the pictures he executed have disappeared. In 1492, from the same body, he received the honorary title of Depentor in Gran Conscio and a stipend of five ducats a month. For some years he was by most critics connected with Giovanni Bellini, by some regarded as Bellini's pupil, or a foreman in his studio, and by others as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of little interest, an unimportant Muranese <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, who imitated Bellini's methods and copied his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and technique. It is very largely owing to Bernhard Berenson's investigations when compiling his work on <a href="../cathen/09367a.htm">Lotto</a> that Alvise has been given his rightful position as an eminent <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, who exercised great and lasting influences on his successors. He was an original workman, highly thought of in his own time, a great figure amongst the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> masters of the fifteenth century, by no means an unimportant member of the Vivarini <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and not a follower of Bellini, but eminent on his own account, and also because he was the master of <a href="../cathen/03772a.htm">Cima</a>, <a href="../cathen/09367a.htm">Lotto</a>, Montegna, and Bonsignori. His influence upon his pupils is considerable, and extends to others who were not specially known as his pupils, as Basaiti, <a href="../cathen/12280a.htm">Pordenone</a>, and Antonello da Messina.

<p>His first dated work is the polyptych of 1475, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for Montefiorentino, and still to be seen in that <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. His Madonna of 1480 is in the Venice Academy. There is a picture <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1483 at Barletta, one at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> of 1485, a Madonna at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1489, a head of the Saviour in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1493), a Resurrection at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> also of 1498. Then we come to the last great work, that of "St. Ambrose Enthroned", in the Frari Church at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, commenced in 1501, left incomplete at his death, and finished by Marco Basaiti. Many other works of his still exist, but are without date, and recent criticism has given back to Alvise a number of portraits which have hitherto passed under other names. There is but one signed portrait by him, that which formed part of the Salting Bequest; but, taking that as a starting-point, the pictures at Windsor Castle, in the Stuttgart Gallery, in the gallery at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and in the possession of the Comtesse de Bearn, have been with considerable probability attributed to this <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. Many judges also attribute to him a portrait bequeathed to the National Gallery by the Misses Cohen as well as one belonging to Lord Wemyss, another in the possession of Lady Layard, and a fourth in the Signoria in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>.
<h2>Antonio Vivarini</h2>

<p>Born probably at Murano during the early part of the fifteenth century; died probably at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, after 1470. He may be regarded as the father of the famous Murano <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. Of his history we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> very little. He gave security for his wife's dower on 4 February, 1446. Where he acquired his early teaching in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> is not known, but he was undoubtedly influenced by <a href="../cathen/06421a.htm">Gentile da Fabriano</a> and by Pisanello. He worked in partnership with Giovanni da Murano; the earliest dated work bearing their united names is in the Academy at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1440, while another copy of it is in the Church of St. Pantaleone, and is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1444. The <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> shutters of San Giorgio Maggiore executed by the two <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1445, the "Virgin and Child Enthroned", in the Academy at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, bears the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the following year. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the existence of a picture, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1447, which used to be in <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, but which has disappeared; about that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> Giovanni Murano probably died, because in 1450 Antonio entered into partnership with his brother Bartolomeo, and the Bologna Gallery possesses a very fine picture signed by the two brothers in 1450 and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the Certosa. A picture was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Francesco at Padua in the following year; the partnership broke up in 1459, and the pictures following that time are signed by Antonio alone. The only really important one is now in the Lateran Gallery, and is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1467. Other places where the works of this <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> may be studied are <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>, Pausula, <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.
<h2>Bartolommeo Vivarini (Bartolommeo da Murano)</h2>

<p>Born evidently at Murano, probably about 1425; died about 1499, certainly after 1490. He was a younger brother of Antonio, and must have been largely responsible for the artistic training of Alvise. His earliest dated work is the great group of the "Madonna and Child with Saints" (now in the gallery at Bologna), originally <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the Certosa of that city, and regarded in northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as one of the finest creations of its time. It bears a long inscription commemorating the faithful services of <a href="../cathen/01258b.htm">Cardinal Nicolo Albergati</a>, the friend of Pope Nicolas V, who gave the commission for the picture. Another work signed by the brothers represents the "Glory of Saint Peter", <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Francesco at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and now in the gallery of that city. Signed by Bartolommeo only, but with his full family name of Vivarini, is the panel of San Giovanni Capistrano (now in the Louvre), the earliest example bearing his signature alone. In 1464 the partnership appears to have relaxed, and then Bartolommeo stood as an independent <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and a man of great originality and distinct personal qualities. In 1465 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> his picture of the "Enthroned Virgin" (now in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> Museum) for a church at <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>. In 1473 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Formosa (Venice) the "Virgin of Mercy", and in the same year his superb figure of Saint Augustine. To the following year belongs the Frari picture of the "Enthroned St. Mark". The picture of "St. Ambrose" at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1477; the "Virgin and Child" at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1478; another "Virgin and Child" now at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 1481; a smaller altarpiece now in the Frari church, 1482; and the "Saint Mary Magdalene" in the Academy at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> is dated the same year. The last signed portrait is that of <a href="../cathen/02284d.htm">Saint Barbara</a> in the Academy at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; it is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1490, but contemporary evidence seems to prove that Bartolommeo lived for several years after that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. In addition to the places mentioned, there are examples of his work at <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, Pausula, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, U.S.A.</a>, in the collection of Mr. Shaw, and in the collection of Lord Wemyss at Gosford. There are of course many pictures by his which bear no dates.
