<h1>Viviers</h1>  

<p>(VIVARIUM).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; includes the Department of Ard&egrave;che, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It was suppressed by the Concordat of 1802, and united to the <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">See of Mende</a>. Re-established in 1822, the diocese then included almost all the ancient Diocese of Viviers, and some part of the ancient <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Diocese of Valence</a>, Vienne, <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, and Uz&egrave;s (see N&Icirc;MES), and was suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Archdiocese of Avignon</a>. St. And&eacute;ol, disciple of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, evangelized the Vivarais under <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 208. His body was buried by Blessed Tullie. The "Old Charter", drawn up in 950 by Bishop Thomas, is the most complete document we possess concerning the primitive Church of Viviers. It mentions five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who lived at Alba Augusta (Aps): Saints <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">Januarius</a>, Septimus, Maspicianus, Melanius, and Avolus. The last was a victim of the invasion of the barbarian Chrocus (the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of which is unknown). In consequence of the ravages suffered by Alba Augusta, the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Auxonius, transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Viviers about 430. Promotus was probably the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Viviers; the document also mentions later several <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Saints Lucian and Valerius (fifth and sixth centuries); St. Venantius, disciple of <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a>, who was present at the councils held in 517 and 535; St. Melanius II (sixth century); <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a>, St. Firminus, St. Aulus, St. Eumachius, St. Longinus (seventh century); St. Arcontius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (date unknown, perhaps later than the ninth century.

<p>It seems that the Diocese of Viviers was disputed, for a long time, by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Sees of Vienne and Arles. From the eleventh century its dependence on Vienne was not contested. John II, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Viviers (1073-95), had the abbatial church of Cruas <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, and accompanied him to the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>. Afterwards, it is said that Conrad III gave Lower Vivaraisas an independent suzerainty to Bishop William (1147). In the thirteenth century, under the reign of St. Louis, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Viviers was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Seneschal of Beucaire. By the treaty of 10 July, 1305 <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Viviers to admit the suzerainty of the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> over all their temporal domain. We may also mention as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Peter of Mortemart (1322-25), counsellor of King Charles IV, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (1327); Peter of Sarc&eacute;nas (1373-75), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in (1375); John Fraczon, Cardinal de Brogny (1392-98), a swineherd during his childhood, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1385, and later, vice-chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>; he took an important part in the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>; Alexander Farnese (1560-65), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1534.

<p>Under Bishop Bonnel (1836-1841), there occurred in the Diocese of Viviers the extraordinary movement of <em>allignolisme</em>. The brothers, Charles-R&eacute;gis Allignol and Augustin Allignol, b. at La Rouvi&egrave;re, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, published in 1839 a work entitled "L'Etat actuel du clerg&eacute; en France", in which they demanded the immovability of the <em>succursalistes</em>; installation of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> to assist the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the representation for the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at councils; suppression of fees, and the modification of studies at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Boyer, director of the Seminary of St-Sulpice, refuted the writing of the brothers Allignol in a book which he wrote, and they were removed by Bishop Bonnel. The older of the two brothers hastened to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> and many <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> received him kindly. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered that their book should be submitted to two <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, but that no "note of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>" was to be attached. <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Father Perrone</a>, one of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, judged the book severely, and noticed in it propositions in it impregnated with <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterianism</a>. But the brothers, claiming that they were favoured by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and alleging in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they had been allowed to have a private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, continued to create disturbance in the Diocese of Viviers. Meanwhile (1841) Jean-Hippolyte Guibert, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Viviers.

<p>Thouez, the cur&eacute; of Aubenas, who felt kindly to the brothers Alignol, although he recommended moderation to them, and reprimanded their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, tried to shield them from the displeasure of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The latter soon perceived that their efforts to democratize the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were very dangerous; this tendency was supported by Savin, <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Viviers, and by Tailhant, cur&eacute; of Vesseaux, who published two pamphlets in favour of restoring to the <em>succursalistes</em> their social position. On 31 Aug., 1844, the Allignolist party published in "Le Bien Social" a long diatribe against Bishop Guibert, and copies of this newspaper were distributed to all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of he diocese, then assembled for the retreat. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was offended, forbade the Allignol brothers to use the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, suspended the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of Viviers, and published, 6 Jan., 1845, a pastoral letter "on dangerous tendencies of a party springing up in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> against episcopal authority". This letter was approved by <a href="../cathen/08760b.htm">Cardinal Lambruschini</a>, Secretary of State of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. After that Guibert, 2 June, 1845, published a new pastoral letter <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> an answer from <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> on the subject of <em>succursalistes</em>. The Allignols submitted, and <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, 26 Nov., 1845, sent to Bishop Guibert a congratulatory <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> end of the crisis, which might have resulted in an agitation against the Concordat itself.

<p>Several <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are connected with the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, St. Vincent (end of third century), protector of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; St. Just, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (end of the fourth century), belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Counts of Tournon; St. Montan, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> (fifth century); St. Ostianus (sixth century), confessor, a relative of Sigismund, King of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>. St. Agr&egrave;ve, who (according to some legends) was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in Vivarais, on the present site of the city of St-Agr&egrave;ve (seventh century); the Blessed Amadeus, founder of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Mazan (d. 1140); St. Benezet, shepherd (1165-86), builder of the bridge of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, b. in Vivarais; the Blessed Guigues I, fifth <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Grande Chartreuse, friend of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, and writer of the "Statuta ordinis Carthusiensis" (twelfth century); St. Francis Regis.

<p>The following were natives of the Diocese of Viviers: Cardinal de Tournon (1489-1502), an active diplomatist in the service of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, and who presided at the Colloguy of Poisy, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>, and Lyons, and Abb&eacute; of St. Germain-des-Pres; Cardinal de Bernis (1715-94); <a href="../cathen/02310a.htm">Abb&eacute; Barruel</a>, controversialist (1741-1820); the Joyeuse <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/08530c.htm">Ange de Joyeuse</a> was a member, were natives of Vivarais.

<p>Viviers was often troubled by religious conflicts: the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> in the thirteenth century; the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> against Louis XIII (1627-29), which ended in the capture of Privas by the royal army; the Dragonnades under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03218a.htm">Camisards</a>. Viviers honours the memory of several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who died heroically during the conflict with the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>; we must especially mention the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> assembled in synod at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Villeneuve de Berg (March,1 573); the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Jean Salez, and of his companion Sautemouche at Aubenas (February, 1583); the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Father Jerome, a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the troops of Louis XIII, surprised by <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> at Privas (15 May, 1629). The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame de Ch&acirc;lons and Notre-Dame d'Ay, near Satillieu (both existing since the twelfth century); Notre-Dame de Montaigu at Tournon (dating from 1628); Notre-Dame de Bon Secours, at La Blach&egrave;re (end of seventeenth century), Notre-Dame de la D&eacute;liverance, Chapais (in existence since the Reign of Terror), and especially the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. John Francis Regin (La Louvesc).

<p>There were, in the Diocese of Viviers, before the application of the Associations law of 1901; <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>; Religious of St. Mary of the Assumption; <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>; and several orders of teaching brothers. The Order of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilians</a> had been founded in 1800 at Annonay by d'Aviau, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, for the recruiting of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. <a href="../cathen/05132a.htm">Cardinal Donnet</a>, and several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, were pupils of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilians</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 1881 regarding the congregations had been <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilians</a> joined the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. Among the orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> founded in the diocese mention may be made of: the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary, who teach and nurse the sick, founded in 1796 by Ven. Marie Rivier (1768-1838) with a mother-house at Bourg-St-And&eacute;ol; the Sisters of Providence, founded at Annonay by Mary and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Liond, for the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls; the Sisters of St. Francis Regis, founded at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Abb&eacute; Therme (1791-1834) for the insturction of poor children, with a mother-house at Aubenas. At the end of the nineteenth century the Diocese of Viviers had 2 cr&egrave;ches; 30 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for deaf mutes; 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> for boys; 14 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> for girls; 2 houses of correction and reform; 2 refuges; 11 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for nursing the sick at home; 1 home for convalescents; 1 asylum for the insane; 10 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or alms-houses. The population of the Diocese of Viviers was in 1905 (the last year of the Concordat), 353,564; there were 37 first class <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 334 second class <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 134 vicarages paid by the state.
