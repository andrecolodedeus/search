<h1>Voluntarism</h1>  

<p>Voluntarism (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>voluntas</em>, will) in the modern metaphysical sense is a theory which explains the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as emanating ultimately from some form of will. In a broader <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> sense, the term is applied to any theory which gives prominence to will (in opposition to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>). In this latter sense, but not in the former, the philosophy of Augustine, Anselm, <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Occam</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> may be styled Voluntarism. Philosophy is defined by Augustine as "Amor sapienti&aelig;" ("De ordine", I, 11, n. 32; PL 32:993; <a href="../fathers/120108.htm"><em>City of God</em> VIII.2</a>). It is wisdom, but it must be sought <em>pie, caste, et diligenter</em> ("De quant. an.", PL 32:1049); with the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> only. Yet nowhere does Augustine subordinate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to will. The <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> which underlies the whole of his philosophic speculation makes such an attitude impossible. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of grace and of providence supposes a definite and characteristic <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> of will. But in the metaphysical order <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is ever conceived as essentially intelligence. He is the "Father of Truth". On this is based a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a>, which occurs several times in his works and is peculiarly Augustinian in tone ("De div.", Q. 83, 14; PL 40:38; "De lib. arb.", II, nn. 7-33; PL 32:1243-63; "Confess.". VII, c. 10, n. 16; PL 32:742; "Soliloq.", I, i, n. 2; PL 32:870; cf. <a href="../fathers/120108.htm"><em>City of God</em> VIII.4</a>). In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Augustine places "the intelligible world" of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, and the Divine <em>concursus</em> is a special way required by human thought. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is "the sun of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" ("Gen. ad lit." XII, xxxi, n. 59; PL 34:479; <a href="../fathers/15011.htm"><em>Of Sin and Merit</em> I.25.38</a>; cf. "Soliloq.", I, 8; PL 32:877), Himself performing the functions which <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> ascribe to the <em>intellectus agens</em>. Faith, too, with Augustine as with Anselm, involves intelligence. For the principle <em>intelligo ut credam</em> is no less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> than the principle <em>credo ut intelligam</em>. ("In Ps. cxviii", serm. xviii, n. 3; PL 37:1552; serm xliii, c. vii, n. 9; PL 38:258.)

<p>The philosophy of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> is more distinctly voluntaristic. On the freedom of the will he is particularly clear and emphatic. He insists that the will itself, and nothing but the will, is the total cause of its volitions. It is not determined by another, but determines itself <em>contingenter</em>, not <em>inevitabiliter</em>, to one of the alternatives that are before it (II Sent., dist. xxv; see also "ult comm." ibid). This is freedom, an attribute which is essential to all higher forms of will, and consequently is not suspended or annulled in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> (IV Send., dist. xlix, Q. 4). Because the will holds sway over all other faculties and again because to it pertains the charity which is the greatest of the virtues, will is a more noble attribute of man than is intelligence. Will supposes intelligence, is <em>posterior generatione</em>, and therefore more perfect (IV Sent., dist. xlix, 4 "qu&aelig;stio lateralis").

<p><a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> "practical reason", in that it passes beyond the phenomenal world to which "pure reason" is confined, is superior to the latter. Practical reason, however, is not will: rather it is an intelligence which is moved by will; and in any case it is a human faculty, not a faculty of the absolute. Fichte is the first to conceive will or deed-action (<em>Thathandlung</em>) as the ultimate and incomprehensible source of all being. He is followed by Schelling, who says that will is <em>Ursein:</em> there is no other being than it, and of it alone are predicable the attributes usually predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Schopenhauer holds will to be prior to intelligence both in the metaphysical and the physical order. It appears in nature first as a vague self-consciousness mingled with sympathy. Ideas come later, as differences are emphasized and organization developed. But throughout the will holds sway, and in its repose Schopenhauer places his ideal. Nietzsche transforms "the will to live" into "the will to power". His philosophy breathes at once tyranny and revolt: tyranny against the weak in body and in mind; revolt against the supremacy of the State, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of convention.

<p><a href="../cathen/12333b.htm">Pragmatism</a> is an extreme form of <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> Voluntarism; and with it is closely connected <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>--a wider theory, in which the function of the will in the "making of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" is extended to the making of reality. The Voluntarism of Absolutists, such as Fichte, Schelling and Schopenhauer, confuses the abstract concept of being, as activity in general, with the more determinate, <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> concept of will, as rational self-determination. The pragmatist identifies intelligence and will with action.
