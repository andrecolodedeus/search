<h1>Von W&ouml;rndle Family</h1>  

<h2>Philip von W&ouml;rndle</h2>

<p>Of Adelsfried and Weierburg, major of a Tyrolese rifle-corps, commandant in the militia reserve, b. at Hotting-Innsbruck, 9 July, 1755; d. at <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 2 August, 1818. He belonged to an old noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Tyrol and was the son of Joseph Anthony W&ouml;rndle, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the peace of Sonnenburg, who was reinstated in the nobility in 1763 by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a> as a reward for his military and patriotic services. Philip von W&ouml;rndle received the degree of Doctor of Law at the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a> in 1779. At first he was judge of the manor court of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbey of Wilten, then became an advocate. In 1787 he married Elisabeth von Lemmen, by whom he had seven children; in 1800 he married a second wife, Johanna von Lemmen. In 1796 he was the captain of the company raised among those connected with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> which served in the campaign against Lecourbe on the boundary of the Tyrol towards <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and also at Lake Garda. In 1797 he was commander of the reserve of northern Tyrol under General Kerpen in the campaign against Joubert, and as such shared in the victorious but bloody encounter at Springes in which the Tyrolese took part (2 April, 1797). In 1800 he was district military commissioner under Generals Hiller and Jallachich for the upper valley of the Inn. In 1809, under Andreas Hofer, he was Tyrolese under-commissary and head of the national defence for the valley of the Puster. In return for his services he received the Tyrolese commemorative medal and the gold imperial medal. On account of the occupation of the province in 1810 he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; in 1811 he was a member of the district council at <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a> in upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. In 1813 he accompanied, as provincial commissioner, the imperial troops under General Ismer on the campaign for the liberation of southern Tyrol from the French. On account of accusations lodged against him by commissary Roschmann, W&ouml;rndle remained in exile from his native country and died in Upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.
<h2>Edmund von W&ouml;rndle</h2>

<p>Grandson of the preceding and son of Johann von W&ouml;rndle, clerk of the works for the imperial palace at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, b. 28 July, 1827; d. 3 August, 1906. After attending the high-school at Schossen Abbey, he entered the academy of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In 1846 he began the study of landscape <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> at the art-school under Professors Thomas Euder and Franz Steinfeld and continued under them until 1853, frequently receiving academic prizes. At the same time he also attended F&uuml;hrich's lectures on composition and the theory of style; from this sprang his firm adherence, like that of Joseph Anton Koch, to "historic landscape". In 1855 he went on a journey for study to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Palestine: this was followed by a residence for two years with an imperial pension in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. While in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he made large chalk cartoons from his sketches in the Holy Land; these were bought by the picture gallery of the city of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, while a few of his sketches were finished as oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> which were bought by Emperor Francis Joseph I, Cardinal Simor-Grau, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> Viale Prela, and others. Some of the cartoons were engraved by the artist on copper; in 1904 the cartoons were published at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> as chromos. From 1858 he lived at Castle Weierburg, and from 1864 at Muhlau near Innsbruck; from 1874 his permanent residence was at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>. He produced large numbers of easel pictures and others containing large figures, as: "Christ at Jacob's Well", owned by the Grand Duke of Weimar; "Samson as the Lion-Killer", in the Ferdinandeum at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>; "Hunting-Scenes" owned by Emperor Francis Joseph. In 1877 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a series of Tyrolean landscapes for the city savings-bank of Innsbruck; he also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> decorative historical wall-pictures of scenes in the Tyrolese <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of liberation in the Hofer-room at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, as well as others for the Heart of Jesus <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> completed by his efforts in 1899, in the Hofer-house called "Sand in Passeier", and landscapes for the corridor of the Kurhaus at Meran. He showed himself to be particularly representative of the Romantic School in the great series of "Parzival" <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, in which his brother August had some share, which he was commissioned by the Austrian minister of worship and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to execute for the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys called the Vinzentinum at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, and which were based on thorough preparatory study of Wolfram von Eschenbach. Lithographic copies of this series have been published at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. A second series of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, "Walter von der Vogelweide", in the Ferdinandeum at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, was published by himself in lithograph in 1894. He was the founder and honorary president of the "Society of Ecclesiastical Art of the Tyrol", for many years a member of the board of directors of the art association of the Tyrol, honorary member of the Veterans' Union of Innsbruck, and in 1904 was made a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> of the Francis Joseph Order. In 1858 he married Sophie von Attlmayr (d. 1898), by whom he had three sons, Hermann, Heinrich, and Wilhelm.
<h2>August von W&ouml;rndle</h2>

<p>Brother of Edmund and son of Johann, b. 22 June, 1829; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 26 April, 1902. He attended first the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of design of Professor Klieber, then in 1844 the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the academy of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, the lectures of Professor Joseph von F&uuml;hrich, and from 1849 F&uuml;hrich's classes for advanced pupils. Later he became F&uuml;hrich's son-in-law. Through the St. Severinus Artists' Association August sold his first easel picture, "The Little Daughter of Jairus", to Empress Caroline Augusta, his "Three <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>" to the imperial picture-gallery at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In 1853 he went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and Florence, in 1854 to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he studied under <a href="../cathen/04376a.htm">Cornelius</a> and <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a> and where he remained until 1859. While at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> numerous religious-historical pictures, collaborated on the cartoons executed by <a href="../cathen/04376a.htm">Cornelius</a> for the Campo Santo at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a portrait of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> for Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, and made a copy of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> "Coronation of the Virgin" for the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the house of the <a href="../cathen/12660b.htm">Prince Archbishop Cardinal Rauscher</a> in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. After his return to the Tyrol he worked (1861-1868) at Weierburg and Muhlau with his brother on the frescoes of the "Stations of the Cross" for the cemetery of Innsbruck and frescoes for the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church at Worgl. Under commission of the Archduke Karl Ludwig, Governor of the Tyrol, he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the frescoes in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the castle of Ambras. He now settled at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where in 1868 he produced <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> for the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Virgin, and for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> on the Freienberg at <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>. In 1869, at the order of the emperor, he executed a large oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, "The Liberation of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>"; he also in this period <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> altar-pictures for <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and Styria, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the stations of the Cross that were sent to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia. In 1872 he was appointed teacher of freehand drawing in the <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> academy for young noblemen at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, a position he held until 1898. While here he executed a number of altar <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> that went particularly to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. In 1874 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> frescoes in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Salzberg, in 1875-76 he prepared the cartoons for the frescoes in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of the newly erected Votive Church at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and the easel picture, "Battle of Springes", for the Ferdinandeum at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>; in 1882 he executed the fresco-painting in the presbytery of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Isehl, a work for which he was commissioned by the emperor; also compositions for "Parzival" and for Weber's "Dreizehnlinder" (Thirteen Linden Trees). He was also the private teacher of the Archdukes Francis Ferdinand and Otto. The last work he did was the entire fresco ornamentation of the Church of St. Anastasius at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1900-01; in recognition of this work he received the cross of the Knights of the Order of Francis Joseph. He was a member of the Austrian commission for historical and artistic remains and of the section for art of the Austrian Leo Association. He married in 1872 Anna von F&uuml;hrich (d. 1909); he had one son, Joseph (d. 1880), and a daughter Paula, now Mother Felicitas, of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>. August von W&ouml;rndle is buried at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>.
