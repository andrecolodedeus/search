<h1>Walafrid</h1>  

<p>(Walahfrid; surnamed Strabo &#151; "the Squinter").

<p>German poet and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the ninth century, born in Swabia or poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; died at Tatto, Erlebold, and Wettin, and later at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> under the famous <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>. In 829 he became precepter of the young Prince Charles (the Bald) at the Court of Louis the Pious. In 838 he succeeded Erlebold as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>; but, as he sided with Lothair in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the sons of Louis, he was driven from <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> and fled to Speyer. He was soon reconciled with Louis the German, and reinstated in his dignity, which he held until his death. Walafrid's works, written in a fluent, elegant Latin, consist of poems and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises in prose. The "Visio Wettini" is his most remarkable poem. It describes a journey through the other world in the form of a vision vouchsafed to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Wettin a few days before he died (824), and is the earliest example of that type of literature which culminated in <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "Divine Comedy." The "Versus de imagine Tetrici," in the form of a dialogue between the poet and his genius, were inspired by the equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> which <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had brought from <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and place before the palace at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. While the Gothic king is denounced as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and tyrant, occasion is found for paying homage to Louis the Pious and the Empress Judith. In the <a href="../cathen/07472a.htm">"Hortulus"</a> the poet lovingly describes the plants and flowers of his cloister-garden. Walafrid also wrote <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and epistles in verse, but of these only a portion is preserved. Of his prose-works the most famous is the "Glossa ordinaria," a commentary on the Scriptures, compiled from various sources. The work enjoyed the highest repute throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The "Liber de exordiis et incrementis quarundam in observationibus ecclesiasticis rerum" is valuable as a history of the cult of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Walafrid also wrote in prose the lives of St. Gall and <a href="../cathen/11351a.htm">St. Othmar</a>, and in verse the lives of St. Blaitmaicus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, and of St. Mammas, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. His works are edited in P.L., CXIII, XIV; the poems also separately by D&uuml;mmler, "Poet&aelig; latini &aelig;vi Carolini," in "Mon. Germ. Hist., " II (Berlin, 1884), 259-473.
