<h1>Walkenried</h1>  

<p>Formerly one of the most celebrated <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, situated in the Duchy of Brunswick between Lauterberg and Nordhausen. Founded in 1127 by Countess Adelheid of Klettenberg, it was confirmed in 1137 by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> came form the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Altfeld or Camp in the <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>. In the time of the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Henry I (1127-28), two branch <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded: Pforta (in 1132) and Sichem, or Sittichenbach (in 1141) in the Countship of Mansfeld. Walkenried grew rich and owned lands as far as the Rhine and <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> gave much attention to mining, smelting, and fishing. In the fifteenth century the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> began to decay, and the <a href="../cathen/11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a> brought it to the verge of destruction. About <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1525, a mob of 800 peasants of the southern Harz region marched against Walkenried. Abbot Paulus (1520-36) and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> fled, carrying off the archives. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was plundered and the tower of the church torn down. The next <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, John VIII (1530-59), was very worldly and extravagant; in 1546 he and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> became <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. Thereupon Count Ernst of Honstein, as patron of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, laid a complaint before <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. In 1548 the emperor ordered that everything in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> should be restored to its former condition, but his command was unheeded. After the count's death the entire Countship of Honstein became <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, and in 1557 a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened at Walkenried. Up to 1578 four <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> had directed the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The Court of Honstein now made his son administrator, and after the son's death Walkenried fell to the Duchy of Brunswick. During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for a short time (1629-31) was restored to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. The Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> put an end to the shadowy existence of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was secularized. In 1668 the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was closed. Since then Walkenried has been state <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of Brunswick. The <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, built during the years 1210-1290, was greatly damaged by the destruction of the tower by the peasants in 1525; today only a few picturesque remains are still in existence. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was somewhat later in date than the church; its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> is well preserved. The chapter hall has served since 1570 as a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> church. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was destroyed by the peasants, but the archives are preserved at Wolfenhuttel.
