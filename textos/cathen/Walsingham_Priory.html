<h1>Walsingham Priory</h1>  

<p>Walsingham Priory stood a few miles from the sea in the northern part of Norfolk, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Founded in the time of Edward the Confessor, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Our Lady of Walsingham was confirmed to the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> a century later and enclosed within the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. From the first this shrine of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> was a famous place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. Hither came the faithful from all parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and from the continent until the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1538. To this day the main road of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> through Newmarket, Brandon, and Fakenham is still called the Palmers' Way. Many were the gifts of lands, rents, and churches to the canons of Walsingham, and many the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought at <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> shrine. Henry III came on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Walsingham in 1241, Edward I in 1280 and 1296, Edward II in 1315, Henry VI in 1455, Henry VII in 1487, and <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1513. <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> from Cambridge in 1511, and left as his offering a set of Greek verses expressive of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Thirteen years later he wrote his colloquy on <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, wherein the wealth and magnificence of Walsingham are set forth, and some of the reputed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> rationalized. In 1537 while the last prior, Richard Vowell, was paying obsequious respect to Cromwell, the sub-prior Nicholas Milcham was charged with conspiring to rebel against the suppression of the lesser <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and on flimsy evidence was convicted of high treason and hanged outside the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> walls. In July, 1538, Prior Vowell assented to the destruction of Walsingham Priory and assisted the king's commissioners in the removal of the figure of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, of many of the gold and silver ornaments and in the general spoliation of the shrine. For his ready compliance the prior received a pension of 100 pounds a year, a large sum in those days, while fifteen of the canons received pensions varying from 4 pounds to 6 pounds. The shrine dismantled, and the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> destroyed, its site was sold by order of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> to one Thomas Sidney for 90 pounds, and a private mansion was subsequently erected on the spot. The Elizabethan ballad, "A Lament for Walsingham," expresses something of what the Norfolk people felt at the loss of their glorious shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham.
