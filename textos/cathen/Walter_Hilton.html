<h1>Walter Hilton</h1>  

<p>Augustinian mystic, d. 24 March, 1396. Little is known of his life, save that he was the head of a house of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> at Thurgarton, near <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, in Nottinghamshire. He was closely in touch with the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, though not a member of that order. A man of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, his spiritual writings were widely influential during the fifteenth century in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The most famous of these is the "Scala Perfectionis", or "Ladder of Perfection", in two books, first printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1494. This work may be described as a guide-book for the journey to the spiritual <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which is "contemplation in perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is reformed to the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, first in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only, and then in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in feeling. Speeded by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it passes through the mystical dark night, which "is nought else but a forbearing and a withdrawing of the thought and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from earthly things by great desire and yearning for to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and see and feel <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and spiritual things". By the gift of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all the vices are destroyed, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at length becomes a perfect lover of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, "fully united to Him with softness of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>". His presence is the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the life of the body. Purified to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His secret voice, its spiritual eyes are opened to see His workings in all things and to behold His blessed nature. Hilton's mystical system is, in the main, a simplification of that of <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a>, and, like Richard, he humbly disclaims any personal experience of the Divine familiarity which he describes, declaring that he has not the grace of contemplation himself "in feeling and in working, as I have it in talking". The book is distinguished by beauty of thought and simplicity of expression; it is illustrated by homely, but effective imagery, and in spite of its high spirituality it is full of practical guidance. "A soul", it concludes "that is pure, stirred up by grace to use this working, may see more of such spiritual matter in an hour than can be writ in a great book." It was translated into Latin, as "Speculum Contemplationis", or "Bacculum Contemplationis", by Thomas Fyslawe, a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>.

<p>Two other treatises by Hilton were printed in 1506 and 1521 by Pynson and Henry Pepwell, respectively: "To a Devout Man in Temporal Estate", and "The song of Angels". The former contains spiritual counsel for the guidance of a religious man of wealth and social position in the world, one of those to whom the mixed life, that is both active and contemplative, pertains; it shows how the external works that such a one has to perform may be made acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a means to inflame the desire to Him and to the sight of spiritual things. The latter is more purely mystical, dealing with the Divine visitations and spiritual consolations vouchsafed to a contemplative <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on earth that is in perfect charity and purified by the fire of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. A number of other works, attributed with more or less probability to Hilton, remain still unpublished. A curious tradition, dating from <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the fifteenth century, attributes to him a treatise both in Latin and in English, entitled "Musica Ecclesiastica", which is identical with the first three books of the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"De Imitatione Christi"</a>. For this reason, the latter work, now almost universally assigned to <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, has been frequently ascribed to Hilton. The probable explanation is that the "De Imitatione" reached <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> anonymously, and when translated into English was naturally attributed to the one <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical</a> writer whose name was universally known throughout the land.
