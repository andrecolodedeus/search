<h1>Walter of Merton</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester and founder of Merton College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, b. probably at Merton in Surrey or <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there; hence the surname; d. 27 Oct., 1277. He came of a land-owning <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at Basingstoke; beyond that there is no definite information as to the date or place of birth. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his mother was Christina Fitz-Oliver and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> William, and that in 1237 both <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were dead, and Walter was a clerk in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. In 1241 Walter already held a number of livings in various parts of the country; in 1256 he was an agent for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> in a law- suit; in 1259 <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of St. Paul's, London; and in 1262 <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> and canon of Wells. Walter was also prothonotary of the chancery in 1258; and in 1261 Henry III made him chancellor, in place of Nicholas of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>. It was in this same year that Walter first set aside two manors in Surrey for the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> at Merton, for the support of "scholars residing at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>". This was the beginning of Merton College. In 1264 Walter drew up <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> for a "house of the scholars of Merton", at Malden in Surrey; ten years later these scholars were transferred to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, and a permanent house established.

<p>Merton College, thus founded and endowed by Walter, is the earliest example of collegiate life at Oxford. Walter's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> provided for a common corporate life under the rule of a warden, but as <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> were to be taken and scholars entering a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order forfeited their scholarship, the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was really a place of training for the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. While labouring for the establishment of Merton College, Walter was removed from the chancellorship when the barons triumphed in 1263, but was restored again on Henry III's death in 1272. He is mentioned as a justiciar in 1271, and three years later (21 October, 1274) he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester. While fording the Medway, Bishop Walter fell from his horse and died two days later from the effects of the accident. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in Rochester <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and is described in the "Annales monastici" as a man of liberality and great worldly learning, ever ready in his assistance to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders.
