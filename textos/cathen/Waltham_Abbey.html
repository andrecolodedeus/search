<h1>Waltham Abbey</h1>  

<p>The Abbey of Waltham Holy Cross stood in Essex, some ten miles to the northeast of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, on the Middlesex border. In the reign of Kent, one Tofig, a wealthy landowner, built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at Waltham for the reception of a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cross, discovered through a vision in Somerset, and gave endowment for two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. On Tofig's death his Waltham <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> lapsed to the Crown, and King Edward the Confessor granted the estate to Harold. the latter enlarged the foundation of the church and established a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of secular canons. In 1060 the church was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> dedicated to the Holy Cross by Cynesige, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and Wlwin became its first dean. It is said that Harold's body was brought to Waltham for burial after the battle of Hastings, but the story has been disputed. The secular canons were displaced in 1177 by Henry II in favour of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>, and a prior was appointed. Seven years later Walter de Gant was made the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and Waltham became the most important Augustinian house in the country. Its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was mitred, sat in Parliament, enjoyed peculiar exemption from episcopal visitation, and received at various times special favours from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> also obtained a number of valuable privileges and charters from the Crown. At the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in 1537, Waltham was assessed at a gross annual value of &#163;1079 2s. 1d., and was the richest religious house in Essex. It outlasted every other <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the country, and was only formally surrendered on 23 March, 1540, by its last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Robert Fuller, who retired with a pension of &#163;200 and with several manors and church advowsons. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> lands were leased to Sir Anthony Denny, and were subsequently purchased outright by his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in 1549. The choir and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> were destroyed, but the west end of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church was set apart as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church for the new service of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, and remains to this day as a place of worship for <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>.
