<h1>Washing of Feet and Hands</h1>  

<p>Owing to the general use of sandals in Eastern countries the washing of the feet was almost everywhere recognized from the earliest times as a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of courtesy to be shown to guests (<a href="../bible/gen018.htm#vrs4">Genesis 18:4</a>, <a href="../bible/gen019.htm#vrs2">19:2</a>; <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs44">Luke 7:44</a>, etc.). The action of Christ after the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs1">John 13:1-15</a>) must also have invested it with a deep religious significance, and in fact down to the time of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> we find <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, at least occasionally, applying to this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> the term <em>Sacramentum</em> in its wider sense, by which they no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> meant that it possessed the virtue of what we now call a sacramental. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> command to wash one another's feet must have been understood from the beginning in a literal sense, for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs10">1 Timothy 5:10</a>) implies that a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be one "having testimony for her <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> feet". This tradition, we may believe, has never been interrupted, though the evidence in the early centuries is scattered and fitful. For example the Council of Elvira (A.D. 300) in canon xlviii directs that the feet of those about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are not to be washed by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> but presumably by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or at least <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a>. This practice of washing the feet at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was long maintained in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but it was not apparently known in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or in the East. In Africa the nexus between this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> became so close that there seemed danger of its being mistaken for an integral part of the rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself (Augustine, Ep. LV, "Ad Jan.", n. 33). Hence the washing of the feet was in many places assigned to another day than that on which the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> took place. In the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> found favour as a practice of charity and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> directs that it should be performed every Saturday for all the community by him who exercised the office of cook for the week; while it was also enjoined that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and the brethren were to wash the feet of those who were received as guests. The act was a religious one and was to be accompanied by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and psalmody, "for in our guests <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> and receive". The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> washing of feet (if we can trust the negative evidence of our early records) seems only to have established itself in East and West at a comparatively late date. In 694 the Seventeenth Synod of Toledo commanded all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in a position of superiority under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to wash the feet of those subject to them. The matter is also discussed by Amalarius and other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> of the ninth century. Whether the custom of holding this "maundy" (from "Mandatum novum do vobis", the first words of the initial Antiphon) on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, developed out of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> practice originally attached to that day does not seem quite clear, but it soon became an universal custom in <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and collegiate churches. In the latter half of the twelfth century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> washed the feet of twelve sub-deacons after his Mass and of thirteen poor men after his dinner. The <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"Caeremoniale episcoporum"</a> directs that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to wash the feet either of thirteen poor men or of thirteen of his canons. The <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and his assistants are vested and the Gospel "Ante diem festum paschae" is ceremonially sung with <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and lights at the beginning of the function. Most of the sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> used also formerly to perform the maundy. The custom is still retained at the Austrian and Spanish courts.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> washing of hands has already been treated in the article <a href="../cathen/09044b.htm">LAVABO</a>. It may be noted that possibly in consequence of the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs8">1 Timothy 2:8</a>): "I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands", the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> made it a rule to wash their hands even before private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as many passages of the Fathers attest (e.g. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Apolog.", xxxix; "De Orat.", xiii). The multiplied washings in a <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a> probably bear witness to the practice of an earlier age. Let us notice also that the <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"Caeremoniale episcoporum"</a> enjoins the use of the <em>credenza</em> or tasting as a precaution against poison even for the water used in the washing of hands.
