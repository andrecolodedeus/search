<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Washington, D.C.</h1>  

<p>(DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA)

<p>Washington, the capital of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, is situated on the left bank of the Potomac River, 108 miles from its mouth in Chesapeake Bay: latitude (Capitol), N. 38&#176; 53'; longitude, W. 77&#176;. The original district (10 miles sq.) was reduced by the retrocession of Alexandria County to <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, in 1846, to the present approximate land area of 60 sq. miles. The population, according to census of 1910, was 331,069, and was classified as wholly urban: the county organization (Washington County, D.C.) was abolished in 1874, and the city of Washington is now coextensive with the District of Columbia. The larger part of the district is built up, and, because of its predominant urban character, whatever farm land exists possesses its chief value as a potential residence <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.

<p>The Continental Congress had held its sessions in different places, principally at Philadelphia, and there was no permanent seat of the general government until after the adoption of the Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The following provision, enumerating the powers of Congress (Sec. 8, Art. I), was included in that instrument: "To exercise exclusive <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular States and acceptance of Congress, become the seat of Government of the Untied States". Various places were proposed, and much warmth of feeling and sectional jealousy were elicited in the debates on the resolutions and bills introduced before Congress on the subject: the States of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and Virginia, in 1788 and 1789, had offered the requisite area, and the "acceptance of Congress", under Acts of 16 July, 1790, and 31 March, 1791, constituted the District of Columbia the seat of the national government. The territory thus selected was determined as to its exact location and boundaries by George Washington: it included within its limits the flourishing boroughs of Georgetown, Montgomery County (Maryland), and Alexandria (Virginia); the rest of the territory was rural. The president was also authorized to appoint three commissioners to lay out and survey a portion of the District for a federal city, to acquire the land, and to provide buildings for the residence of the president, the accommodation of Congress and the use of the government departments. One of the commissioners thus appointed was Daniel Carroll "of Duddington", of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Bishop John Carroll, and one of the principal landed proprietors of the District; <a href="../cathen/09150a.htm">Mayor Charles Pierre L'Enfant</a>, a French <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, was employed to furnish a plan of the city, and to him the credit of its magnificent design is mainly due; James Hoban, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, won by competition the prize offered for a plan of the president's house, and the "White House" is constructed in accordance with his design. The <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> was laid (13 October, 1792) by President Washington, who also officiated at the laying of the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the north wing of the Capitol (18 September, 1793): the site which the Capitol occupies was part of the land of Daniel Carroll, and was practically a gift from him to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>The first local authorities of Washington were the president, three commissioners appointed by him, and the Levy Court; the city was incorporated in 1802, with a city council elected by the people, and a mayor appointed by the president. Robert Brent, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and nephew of Bishop Carroll, was the first mayor, and was annually reappointed by Presidents Jefferson and Madison until 1812; in 1812 the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of electing the mayor devolved on the council, and from 1820 to 1871 on the people. In 1817 the charters of the corporations of Washington and Georgetown were abolished by Act of Congress; for a brief time the District was assimilated to a territorial form of government, with a board of public works as the most important administrative factor. Since 1878 it has been governed by a board of three commissioners appointed by the president, with the approval of the senate. The District of Columbia is neither a state nor a territory, but a municipal corporation, holding the same relation to the government of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> that the other municipal corporations do to their own state governments. It has no share in the election of president, nor any district representation in Congress: its inhabitants have no voice in national legislation, and, since 1874, not even any part in local self-government, except by favour of Congress.

<p><a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father Andrew White, S.J.</a>, "the Apostle of Maryland", was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to visit this region: in 1639 he established a mission at Kittamaquund, a few miles below Washington, and, with solemn <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the <em>tayac</em>, or "Emperor of Piscataway". He also carried the Gospel still nearer to a Washington. The "Annual Letter" for 1641 mentions that the King of the Anacostans was a most promising candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The tribe from which the Anacostia River (eastern branch) is named, dwelt in the immediate neighbourhood, and on the site of the national capital: so that the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the District is traced back to the earliest days of Lord Baltimore's Colony. As settlements advanced up the country from lower <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, a fair proportion of those who acquired land in what is now the District were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1669 "a parcell of land. . .called <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. . .was layd out of Francis Pope. . .extending to the south of an inlet called Tiber"; this gentleman, "Pope of Rome on the Tiber", was sheriff of Charles County, and, in all probability, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The well-known <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of Carroll, Digges, Queen, and Young were the possessors of extensive landed estates before the American Revolution. There was no church in the region during the early decades of the eighteenth century, as the public exercise of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was prohibited by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>: the faithful depended for spiritual aid on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> from White Marsh, Prince George's County, or St. Thomas' Manor, Charles County. Stations were visited and <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in private houses, a room being set aside for the purpose, the neighbours being invited. An interesting collection of vestments, altar furnishings, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a> etc., relics of those stations and memorials of the old <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions, is preserved in the museum of <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>. The independence of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> ensured religious liberty, and new era for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> began in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. Father John Carroll, having returned to America in 1774, resided at Rock Creek, from which he made missionary excursions to all the neighbouring region, including what is now the District. In 1784, he has appointed superior of the American Church, and his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a> at Lulworth Castle, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in 1790, to the Sea of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> coincided with the selection of Washington as the seat of government. The District of Columbia has always been included in the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Diocese of Baltimore</a>. In 1789 Bishop Carroll had already taken steps for the establishment of <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>, where, on 4 May, 1912, a bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> to his memory as founder was erected by the Alumni Association, with imposing ceremonies and addresses by the chief <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the Supreme Court, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, the attorney--general representing the president, Cardinal Gibbons, the Ambassador of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, dean of the Diplomatic Corps, and the speaker of the House of Representatives.



<p>The oldest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the District is <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, Georgetown: the original edifice, erected by Father Francis Neale, S.J., is still standing, but is now used as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The register of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> and <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, beginning with 1795, has entries of people "living in the Federal City", even after the name of Washington had been officially adopted. The present Trinity Church dates from 1844. St. Patrick's is the parent church of Washington city proper, the land for it having been acquired in 1794 by Father Anthony Caffry; the first church was a one-and-a- half-story frame house. St. Mary's, or Barry's Chapel as it was generally called, was built by a merchant of that name, in 1806, for the accommodation of the workmen at Greanleaf's Point, near the Navy Yard; this <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> disappeared long ago, but its <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> was saved, and is now inserted in the outer wall of the Holy Name Chapel, the Church of St. Dominic. Queen's Chapel, in the north-east section, existed in 1816, and perhaps earlier, but was destroyed during the Civil War. In 1805 Father William Matthews became the second <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's, and continued in that position for nearly half a century; he was the first native-born American to be raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Among his assistants was <a href="../cathen/12116a.htm">Father Charles Constantine Pise</a>, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the United States Senate, 1832-1833, and among his parishioners were: <a href="../cathen/14442c.htm">Roger Brooke Taney</a>, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; <a href="../cathen/09150a.htm">Mayor L'Enfant</a>, who drew the plan of the city; James Hoban, the architect of the White House; Robert Brent, the first mayor of Washington; Dr. Ironside, a distinguished convert; and Mayor Thomas Carbery, a brother of Mrs. Ann Mattingly, whose wonderful cure in 1824 was held to be <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, Father Matthews being one of the witnesses in the case. The original <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants were mainly <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> planters, of English descent, and their coloured servants; accessions came from other sources, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, German, French, when artisans were required for the construction of public buildings, but the absence of large commercial and industrial activities was a drawback to rapid increase in the general population, and foreign immigration, which has contributed so notably to swell the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> statistics of northern and western cities, has had but little effect on Washington.

<p>St. Peter's and St. Matthew's were the first divisions of St. Patrick's, the original <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, which embraced the whole federal district, Georgetown excepted. There are now (1912) twenty-four churches, two of which (St. Augustine's and St. Cyprian's) are for the exclusive use of coloured people. All the congregations are English-speaking, except St. Mary's, which is German. St. Aloysius' and <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> are in charge of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, and St. Dominic's in charge of the Fathers of St. Dominic. The Apostolic Delegation for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was established in 1893, and the successive delegates, Cardinals <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Satolli</a>, Martinelli, and Falconio, and Archbishop Bonzano, have resided in Washington. The religious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution has been always fully enjoyed; the many representatives of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries in the Diplomatic Corps and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> prominent in Congress and in the departments are factors for social influence and a restraint upon illiberal legislation. All churches, institutions of public charity, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> houses, and cemeteries are exempt from taxation upon all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> not used for business purposes or to secure an income. Subventions, or appropriations to a limited amount, are granted to some of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> funeral services have been held in the Capitol occasionally for foreign <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and members of either house, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> have officiated in the halls of Congress: a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Father Gabriel Richard, of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, was a delegate from <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a> territory to the House of Representatives. The local sentiment towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been, in general, one of good- will. When, during the <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothing</a> craze, a band of bigots secretly took away the memorial slab contributed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to the Washington Monument, which was then being built, the better sentiment of the community condemned that act of vandalism: within the shadow of that same completed monument a solemn field <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in 1911, thousands attending it, and amongst them the chief magistrate of the republic. The grandest civic celebration which the capital has witnessed was that of the Columbus Memorial, 8 June, 1912, when, under the auspices of the <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">Catholic Knights of Columbus</a>, a superb monument was dedicated in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> discoverer of America.

<p>George Washington cherished the hope that the capital would become the home of a great national seat of learning. Although that hope has not yet been realized, in the sense of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> endowed by the Government and under governmental control and patronage, yet Washington is well supplied with institutions for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, offers extraordinary advantages for scientific and literary labour and research, and possesses an unparalleled <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> equipment in the great scientific collections and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of the Government. By authority of Congress, all such facilities for research and information are made accessible to students of institutions of higher learning in the District. This provision applies to the Library of Congress, the National Museum, the Patent Office, the Bureau of Education, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Army Medical Museum, the Department of Agriculture, the Fish Commission, the Botanical Gardens, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Geological Survey, the Naval Observatory, several <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and other departments supplies with special <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, laboratories, and equipment for research. The Library of Congress contains 1,100,000 volumes; Surgeon-General's Office, 140,639: National Museum, 16,000; Museum of Hygiene, 10,5000; Bureau of Ethnology, 5000; Bureau of Education, 30,000; Department of Agriculture, 25,000. The Law Library of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Capitol contains over 100,000 volumes, and is free to students seven hours daily. Washington presents advantages for the study of American <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> which are unequaled elsewhere, and must always remain so. Congress, the Court of Claims, the Supreme Court of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia are in session during several months of each scholastic year, and, with the executive departments, the Patent, Pension, and General Land Offices, furnish advantages for professional study nowhere else enjoyed. There are six law and three medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the city.

<p><a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown University</a>, founded in 1789, and the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a>, canonically instituted by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in 1887, offer in their various departments numerous courses in the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> to men who desire a complete general and liberal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, or who aim at a professional career. The Catholic University has 52 professors, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a> of law, of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, of letters, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. It has affiliated colleges and communities of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Orders, of the Sulpician, <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist</a>, and Holy Cross Congregations, and a Polish house of studies. <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown University</a>, besides the collegiate department, includes <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of law, medicine, and dentistry; attached to the medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, in charge of the Sisters of St. Francis, with a training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for nurses; the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has (1911-1912) 959 students, the largest registration of any law <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. the total number of students in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is 1445. For <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the Academy of the Visitation, Georgetown, and Trinity College, Brookland, are institutions of high standing. A <a href="../cathen/14334a.htm">summer school</a>, under the auspices of the Catholic University, was successfully inaugurated in 1911., for the members of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Besides these are: Gonzaga College, directed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; St. John's College, by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>; the Visitation Academy of Washington; the Immaculate Academy of the Sisters of Providence; academies and high schools, directed by the <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>, Sisters of Charity, Sisters of Notre-Dame, Sisters of the Third <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, and the Oblate Sisters of Providence (for coloured children). Over 4000 pupils attend the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The eleemosynary and benefit institution include St. Ann's Infant Asylum, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> for little boys, another for girls, St. Rose's Technical School, and Providence Hospital (all in care of the Sisters of Charity). The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> conduct a home for self-supporting girls. The houses of the Good Shepherd, the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, and the Bon Secours provide for their special objects of care and charity. Conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> exist in nearly all <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The Christ Child Society, having for its object to provide for all the needs of child life among the destitute, has its headquarters in Washington, with branches in several other cities; the Bureau of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missions has its office here; the Apostolic Mission House was established in 1902 near the Catholic University. It is difficult to determine the exact number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Washington, but it has been estimated to be 30 per cent of the entire population.
