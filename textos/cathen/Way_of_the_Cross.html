<h1>Way of the Cross</h1>  

<p>(Also called Stations of the Cross, Via Crucis, and Via Dolorosa). These names are used to signify either a series of pictures or tableaux representing certain scenes in the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Christ</a>, each corresponding to a particular incident, or the special form of devotion connected with such representations.

<p>Taken in the former sense, the Stations may be of stone, wood, or metal, sculptured or carved, or they may be merely <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> or engravings. Some Stations are valuable works of art, as those, for instance, in Antwerp <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which have been much copied elsewhere. They are usually ranged at intervals around the walls of a church, though sometimes they are to be found in the open air, especially on roads leading to a church or shrine. In <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> they are often placed in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>. The erection and use of the Stations did not become at all general before the end of the seventeenth century, but they are now to be found in almost every church. Formerly their number varied considerably in different places but fourteen are now prescribed by authority. They are as follows: <ol><li>Christ condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>; <li>the cross is laid upon him; <li>His first fall; <li>He meets His Blessed Mother; <li>Simon of <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrene</a> is made to bear the cross; <li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> face is wiped by Veronica; <li>His second fall; <li>He meets the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; <li>His third fall; <li>He is stripped of His garments; <li>His crucifixion; <li>His death on the cross; <li>His body is taken down from the cross; and <li>laid in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>.</ol>

<p>The object of the Stations is to help the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to make in spirit, as it were, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the chief scenes of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's sufferings and death</a>, and this has become one of the most popular of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> devotions. It is carried out by passing from Station to Station, with certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at each and devout meditation on the various incidents in turn. It is very usual, when the devotion is performed publicly, to sing a stanza of the <a href="../cathen/14239b.htm">"Stabat Mater"</a> while passing from one Station to the next.

<p>Inasmuch as the Way of the Cross, made in this way, constitutes a miniature <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the holy places at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the origin of the devotion may be traced to the Holy Land. The Via Dolorosa at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (though not called by that name before the sixteenth century) was reverently marked out from the earliest times and has been the goal of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> ever since the days of Constantine. Tradition asserts that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> used to visit daily the scenes of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> speaks of the crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from all countries who used to visit the holy places in his day. There is, however, no direct evidence as to the existence of any set form of the devotion at that early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, and it is noteworthy that St. Sylvia (c. 380) says nothing about it in her "Peregrinatio ad loca sancta", although she describes minutely every other religious exercise that she saw practised there. A desire to reproduce the holy places in other lands, in order to satisfy the devotion of those who were hindered from making the actual <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, seems to have manifested itself at quite an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Stefano at Bologna a group of connected <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were constructed as early as the fifth century, by <a href="../cathen/11782a.htm">St. Petronius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bologna, which were intended to represent the more important shrines of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and in consequence, this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became familiarly known as "Hierusalem". These may perhaps be regarded as the germ from which the Stations afterwards developed, though it is tolerably certain that nothing that we have before about the fifteenth century can strictly be called a Way of the Cross in the modern sense. Several travellers, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, who visited the Holy Land during the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, mention a "Via Sacra", i.e., a settled route along which <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> were conducted, but there is nothing in their accounts to identify this with the Via Crucis, as we understand it, including special stopping-places with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> attached, and such <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> Stations must, after all, be considered to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> origin of the devotion as now practised. It cannot be said with any <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> when such <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> began to be granted, but most probably they may be due to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, to whom in 1342 the guardianship of the holy places was entrusted. <a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ferraris</a> mentions the following as Stations to which <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were attached: the place where Christ met His Blessed Mother, where He spoke to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where He met Simon of <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>, where the soldiers cast lots for His garment, where He was nailed to the cross, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> house, and the Holy Sepulchre. Analogous to this it may be mentioned that in 1520 <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of a hundred days to each of a set of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptured</a> Stations, representing the Seven Dolours of Our Lady, in the cemetery of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Friary at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, the devotion connected with them being a very popular one. The earliest use of the word <em>Stations</em>, as applied to the accustomed halting-places in the Via Sacra at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, occurs in the narrative of an English pilgrim, William Wey, who visited the Holy Land in 1458 and again in 1462, and who describes the manner in which it was then usual to follow the footsteps of Christ in His sorrowful journey. It seems that up to that time it had been the general practice to commence at Mount Calvary, and proceeding thence, in the opposite direction to Christ, to work back to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> house. By the early part of the sixteenth century, however, the more reasonable way of traversing the route, by beginning at <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> house and ending at Mount Calvary, had come to be regarded as more correct, and it became a special exercise of devotion complete in itself. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries several reproductions of the holy places were set up in different parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The Blessed Alvarez (d. 1420), on his return from the Holy Land, built a series of little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> friary of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, in which, after the pattern of separate Stations, were <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the principal scenes of the Passion. About the same time the Blessed Eustochia, a <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">poor Clare</a>, constructed a similar set of Stations in her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a>. Others that may be enumerated were those at G&ouml;rlitz, erected by G. Emmerich, about 1465, and at Nuremburg, by Ketzel, in 1468. Imitations of these were made at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1505 by Peter Sterckx; at St. Getreu in Bamberg in 1507; at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>, about the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, the two latter being in the commanderies of the Knights of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>. Those at Nuremburg, which were carved by Adam Krafft, as well as some of the others, consisted of seven Stations, popularly known as "the Seven Falls", because in each of them Christ was represented either as actually prostrate or as sinking under the weight of His cross. A famous set of Stations was set up in 1515 by Romanet Bofin at Romans in Dauphine, in imitation of those at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, and a similar set was erected in 1491 at Varallo by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> there, whose guardian, Blessed Bernardino Caimi, had been custodian of the holy places. In several of these early examples an attempt was made, not merely to duplicate the most hallowed spots of the original Via Dolorosa at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but also to reproduce the exact intervals between them, measured in paces, so that devout people might cover precisely the same distances as they would have done had they made the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land itself. Boffin and some of the others visited <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> for the express purpose of obtaining the exact measurements, but unfortunately, though each claimed to be correct, there is an extraordinary divergence between some of them.



<p>With regard to the number of Stations it is not at all easy to determine how this came to be fixed at fourteen, for it seems to have varied considerably at different times and places. And, naturally, with varying numbers the incidents of the Passion commemorated also varied greatly. Wey's account, written in the middle of the fifteenth century, gives fourteen, but only five of these correspond with ours, and of the others, seven are only remotely connected with our Via Crucis:

<ul><li>The house of Dives, <li>the city gate through which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> passed, <li>the probatic pool, <li>the Ecce Homo arch, <li>the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin's</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and <li>the houses of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and Simon the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>.</ul>

<p>When Romanet Boffin visited <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1515 for the purpose of obtaining correct details for his set of Stations at Romans, two <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> there told him that there ought to be thirty-one in all, but in the manuals of devotion subsequently issued for the use of those visiting these Stations they are given variously as nineteen, twenty-five, and thirty-seven, so it seems that even in the same place the number was not determined very definitely. A book entitled "Jerusalem sicut Christi tempore floruit", written by one <a href="../cathen/01161b.htm">Adrichomius</a> and published in 1584, gives twelve Stations which correspond exactly with the first twelve of ours, and this fact is thought by some to point conclusively to the origin of the particular selection afterwards authorized by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially as this book had a wide circulation and was translated into several <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages. Whether this is so or not we cannot say for certain. At any rate, during the sixteenth century, a number of devotional manuals, giving <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for use when making the Stations, were published in the Low Countries, and some of our fourteen appear in them for the first time. But whilst this was being done in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for the benefit of those who could not visit the Holy Land and yet could reach <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Nuremburg, Romans, or one of the other reproductions of the Via Dolorosa, it appears <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether, even up to the end of the sixteenth century, there was any settled form of the devotion performed publicly in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, for Zuallardo, who wrote a book on the subject, published in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1587, although he gives a full series of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, etc., for the shrines within the Holy Sepulchre, which were under the care of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, provides none for the Stations themselves. He explains the reason thus: "it is not permitted to make any halt, nor to pay veneration to them with uncovered head, nor to make any other demonstration". From this it would seem that after <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> had passed under the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> domination the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises of the Way of the Cross could be performed far more devoutly at Nuremburg or <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> than in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> itself. It may therefore be conjectured, with extreme probability, that our present series of Stations, together with the accustomed series of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for them, comes to us, not from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but from some of the imitation Ways of the Cross in different parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and that we owe the propagation of the devotion, as well as the number and selection of our Stations, much more to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ingenuity of certain sixteenth-century devotional writers than to the actual practice of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the holy places.

<p>With regard to the particular subjects which have been retained in our series of Stations, it may be noted that very few of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> accounts make any mention of either the second (Christ receiving the cross) or the tenth (Christ being stripped of His garments), whilst others which have since dropped out appear in almost all the early lists. One of the most frequent of these is the Station formerly made at the remains of the Ecce Homo arch, i.e. the balcony from which these words were pronounced. Additions and omissions such as these seem to confirm the supposition that our Stations are derived from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> manuals of devotion rather than from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> itself. The three falls of Christ (third, seventh, and ninth Stations) are apparently all that remain of the Seven Falls, as depicted by Krafft at Nuremburg and his imitators, in all of which Christ was represented as either falling or actually fallen. In explanations of this it is supposed that the other four falls coincided with His meetings with His Mother, Simon of <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>, Veronica, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and that in these four the mention of the fall has dropped out whilst it survives in the other three which have nothing else to distinguish them. A few <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers take the meeting with Simon and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to have been simultaneous, but the majority represent them as separate events. The Veronica incident does not occur in many of the earlier accounts, whilst almost all of those that do mention it place it as having happened just before reaching Mount Calvary, instead of earlier in the journey as in our present arrangement. An interesting variation is found in the special set of eleven stations ordered in 1799 for use in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Vienne. It is as follows:

<ol><li>the <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">Agony in the Garden</a>; <li>the betrayal by <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>; <li>the scourging; <li>the crowning with thorns; <li>Christ condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>; <li>He meets Simon of <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; <li>He tastes the gall; <li>He is nailed to the cross; <li>His death on the cross; and <li>His body is taken down from the cross. </ol>

<p>It will be noticed that only five of these correspond exactly with our Stations. The others, though comprising the chief events of the Passion, are not strictly incidents of the Via Dolorosa itself.

<p>Another variation that occurs in different churches relates to the side of the church on which the Stations begin. The Gospel side is perhaps the more usual. In reply to a question the Sacred Congregation of Indulgences, in 1837, said that, although nothing was ordered on this point, beginning on the Gospel side seemed to be the more appropriate. In deciding the matter, however, the arrangement and form of a church may make it more convenient to go the other way. The position of the figures in the tableaux, too, may sometimes determine the direction of the route, for it seems more in accordance with the spirit of the devotion that the procession, in passing from station to station, should follow Christ rather than meet Him.

<p>The erection of the Stations in churches did not become at all common until towards the end of the seventeenth century, and the popularity of the practice seems to have been chiefly due to the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> attached. The custom originated with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, but its special connection with that order has now disappeared. It has already been said that numerous <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were formerly attached to the holy places at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Realizing that few <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, comparatively, were able to gain these by means of a personal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land, <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, in 1686, granted to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, in answer to their petition, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to erect the Stations in all their churches, and declared that all the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> that had ever been given for devoutly visiting the actual scenes of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>, could thenceforth be gained by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and all others affiliated to their order if they made the Way of the Cross in their own churches in the accustomed manner. <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> confirmed the privilege in 1694 and <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> in 1726 extended it to all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In 1731 <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> still further extended it by permitting the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> Stations to all churches, provided that they were erected by a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> father with the sanction of the ordinary. At the same time he definitely fixed the number of Stations at fourteen. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1742 exhorted all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to enrich their churches with so great a treasure, and there are few churches now without the Stations. In 1857 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> received faculties from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to erect Stations themselves, with the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> attached, wherever there were no <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> available, and in 1862 this last restriction was removed and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were empowered to erect the Stations themselves, either personally or by delegate, anywhere within their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. These faculties are quinquennial. There is some uncertainty as to what are the precise <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> belonging to the stations. It is agreed that all that have ever been granted to the faithful for visiting the holy places in person can now be gained by making the Via Crucis in any church where the Stations have been erected in due form, but the Instructions of the Sacred Congregation, approved by <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> in 1731, prohibit <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and others from specifying what or how many <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> may be gained. In 1773 <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> attached the same <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, under certain conditions, to crucifixes duly blessed for the purpose, for the use of the sick, those at sea or in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and others lawfully hindered from making the Stations in a church. The conditions are that, whilst holding the crucifix in their hands, they must say the "Pater" and "Ave" fourteen times, then the "Pater", "Ave", and "Gloria" five times, and the same again once each for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> intentions. If one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> hold the crucifix, a number present may gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> provided the other conditions are fulfilled by all. Such crucifixes cannot be sold, lent, or given away, without losing the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>.

<p>The following are the principal regulations universally in force at the present time with regard to the Stations:

<ul><li>If a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> or a superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, etc., wishes to have the Stations erected in their places he must ask permission of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If there are <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers in the same town or city, their superior must be asked to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the Stations or delegate some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> either of his own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>. If there are no <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers in that place the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have obtained from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the extraordinary of Form C can delegate any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to erect the Stations. This delegation of a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for the blessing of the Stations must necessarily be done in writing. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of such a church, or the superior of such a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, etc., should take care to sign the document the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the superior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> sends, so that he may thereby express his consent to have the Stations erected in their place, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> and the respective <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor's</a> or superior's consent must be had before the Stations are blessed, otherwise the blessing is null and void; <li>Pictures or tableaux of the various Stations are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. It is to the cross placed over them that the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is attached. These crosses must be of wood; no other material will do. If only <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on the wall the erection is null (Cong. Ind., 1837, 1838, 1845); <li>If, for restoring the church, for placing them in a more convenient position, or for any other reasonable cause, the crosses are moved, this may be done without the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> being lost (1845). If any of the crosses, for some reason, have to be replaced, no fresh blessing is required, unless more than half of them are so replaced (1839). <li>There should if possible be a separate meditation on each of the fourteen incidents of the Via Crucis, not a general meditation on the Passion nor on other incidents not included in the Stations. No particular <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are ordered; <li>The distance required between the Stations is not defined. Even when only the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> move from one Station to another the faithful can still gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> without moving; <li>It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make all the Stations uninterruptedly (S.C.I., 22 January, 1858). Hearing Mass or going to Confession or Communion between Stations is not considered an interruption. According to many the Stations may be made more than once on the same day, the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> may be gained each time; but this is by no means certain (S.C.I., 10 Sept., 1883). Confession and Communion on the day of making the Stations are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> provided the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> making them is in a state of grace; <li>Ordinarily the Stations should be erected within a church or public oratory. If the Via Crucis goes outside, e.g., in a cemetery or <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, it should if possible begin and end in the church.</ul>

<p>In conclusion it may be safely asserted that there is no devotion more richly endowed with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> than the Way of the Cross, and none which enables us more literally to obey <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> injunction to take up our cross and follow Him. A perusal of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> usually given for this devotion in any manual will show what abundant spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, apart from the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, may be obtained through a right use of them, and the fact that the Stations may be made either publicly or privately in any church renders the devotion specially suitable for all. One of the most popularly attended Ways of the Cross at the present day is that in the Colosseum at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where every Friday the devotion of the Stations is conducted publicly by a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Father.
