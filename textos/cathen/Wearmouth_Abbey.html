<h1>Wearmouth Abbey</h1>  

<p>Located on the river Wear, in <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded in 674 by <a href="../cathen/02441b.htm">St. Benedict Biscop</a> on land given by <a href="../cathen/05327a.htm">Egfrid</a>, King of Northumbria. Benedict dedicated it to St. Peter, and ten years later founded the sister house at Jarrow, on the Tyne, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. These two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were so closely connected in their early history that they are often spoken of as one; but they were really six or seven miles apart. The founder brought workmen from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to build his church at Wearmouth in the Roman fashion and furnished it with glass windows (hitherto unknown in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), pictures, and service-books. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was thus the cradle (as Bishop Hedley has said) not only of English art but of <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> there. Benedict himself was the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> flourished under him and his successors <a href="../cathen/05240a.htm">Easterwin</a>, <a href="../cathen/03536a.htm">St. Ceolfrid</a>, and others, for two hundred years. It suffered greatly from the Danes about 860, and again, after the Conquest, at the hands of Malcolm of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Jarrow was destroyed about the same time, but both <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were restored, though not to their former independence. They became cells subordinate to the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, and were thenceforward occupied by a very small number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The names of only two of the superiors (known as <em>magistri</em>) have been preserved-those of Alexander Larnesley and John Norton.

<p>In 1545 "all the house and seite of the late cell of Wearmouth", valued at about &#163;26 yearly, were granted by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> to Thomas Whitehead, a relative of Prior Whitehead of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, who resigned that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1540 and became the first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> dean. Wearmouth passed afterwards to the Widdrington <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, then to that of Fenwick. The remains of the monastic buildings were incorporated in a private mansion built in James I's reign; but this was burned down in 1790, and no trace is now visible of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> associated with the venerable names of Benedict Biscop, Ceolfrid, and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church occupies the site of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> church. The tower dates from Norman times, and doubtless formed part of the building as restored after the Conquest.
