<h1>Welsh Church</h1>  

<p>In giving separate consideration to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, we follow a practice common among English historical writers and more particularly adopted in the collection of "Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents" of Haddan and Stubbs. There seems, however, no sufficient reason for emphasizing the distinction made by these last authorities between "the British Church during the Roman period" (A.D. 200-450), "the British Church during the period of Saxon Conquest" (A.D. 450-681), and "the Church of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>" (A.D. 681-1295). The term Welsh Church sufficiently covers these separate headings, though it will be convenient to treat the subject according to the same chronological divisions.
<h2>Roman period (200-450)</h2>

<p>Both <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (c. 208) and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (c. 240) use language that implies that the Gospel had been preached in Britain. The former speaks (Adv. Jud., vii) of "the regions of Britain inaccessible to the Romans but subdued to Christ"; the latter of "the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour</a> which is with those who are separated from our world in Britain" (Hom. vi in Luc., 1, 24). These passages may be somewhat rhetorical, but if we do not press the question of date there is confirmatory evidence for at least some acceptance of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Roman Britain. To begin with, both Constantius (A.D. 480), in the uninterpolated portions of his Life of <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a>, and the British <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writer Gildas (A.D. 547) speak of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a> during the Roman period. Again in 314 three British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from York, London, and probably Lincoln seem to attended the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a>, and British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present, if not at Nicaea (325) and at <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> (343), yet certainly at <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Ariminum</a> (359), where the line they adopted drew attention to their nationality. Archaeology also tells us something, if not much, of the presence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in these islands before the close of the Roman period. The Chi-Rho symbol has been found in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> and building stones as well as upon miscellaneous objects; the formulae "Vivas in Deo" and "Spes in Deo" with the "Alpha-Omega" occur stamped on rings or pigs of lead, and in particular the excavations at Silchester have brought to light a small building in which antiquaries are agreed in recognizing a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> basilica. Further, there is the still existing Church of St. Martin's at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, which according to the testimony of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> (Hist. Eccl., I, xxvi), and in the opinion of some experts, is of Roman work. (For all which see Haverfield in "English Historical Review", XI, 417-430.) It should be added that certain authorities, e.g. Professor Hugh Williams, maintain that such <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as existed in Britain at this early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> attached only to the Roman settlements, and that there is no evidence of anything which could be called a native or Cymric <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. The evidence for either view is necessarily inconclusive, but the importance and numerical strength of the Welsh Church in the next period seem to point to the foundations having been laid before the Roman legions were withdrawn. Moreover, towards the close of the Roman period, indeed from early in the fourth century, the literary evidence for an active <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> organization in Britain becomes very strong. The allusion which we find in <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, Sulpicius Severus, etc. (see Haddan and Stubbs, I, 8-16), though slight in themselves, cannot be entirely set aside.

<p>One piece of evidence, however, formerly appealed to by many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialists, must now be abandoned. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> tells us (Hist. Eccl., I, 4) that in the years 156, in the time of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> and Lucius Verus, "while Eleatherus, a holy man, presided over the Roman church, Lucius, King of Britain, sent a letter to him entreating that by his command he might be made a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. He soon obtained the fulfillment of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> request and the Britons preserved the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they received, uncorrupted and entire, in peace and tranquility until the time of the emperor <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>". These dates, to which <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> himself did not consistently adhere (cf. De sex aetat., s.m., 180), are impossible, for St. Eleutherus, at earliest, became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 171. But, apart from this difficulty, it is now generally admitted, e.g. by Duchesne and Kirsch, that the evidence is inadequate to support so startling a conclusion. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede's</a> statement is at best derived from the recension of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> known as the "Catalogus Felicianus", compiled about the year 530, in which we are told that Pope Eleutherus received a letter "a Lucio Britannio rege" asking for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> instruction. In the earlier recension of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> the Lucius episode is wanting. Harnack conjectures that this entry arose from a confusion with Lucius Abgar IX of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, who seems about this period to have become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and who in some early document was possibly described as reigning "in Britio Edessenorum", i.e. in the Britium or Birtha (the citadel) of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. At any rate we are told that the Apostle St. Thaddeus, whose connection with <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> is well known, was buried "in Britio Edessenorum", while it is quite conceivable that the word Britio, if it occurred, may have been mistakenly emended into Britannio and thus have given us a Lucius, King of Britain (see Harnack in the "Sitzungsberichte" of the Berlin Academy, XXVI and XXVII, 1904). This conjecture is by no means certain, but the difficulties against accepting the story of the letter of the supposed Lucius are considerable. Gildas and Aldhelm, who might be expected to refer to the tradition, are both silent, and, although they are equally silent about the mission of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, the first introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is a matter of more fundamental interest. The Lucius story is found in Nennius, and Zimmer on that account believes it to have arisen in Britain, but Nennius is a writer of the ninth century and he calls the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> "Eucharistus". Again the name Lucius is not Celtic, a difficulty which Nennius seems to have felt, and he has accordingly celticized the name into "Llever maur, id est, Magni Splendoris", the great light. The impression thus given, that we must be assisting at the evolution of a myth, is much increased by the later developments. <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> makes Eleutherus's missionaries, named Phaganus and Deruvianus, found a Church at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>. Rudborne makes Lucius endow the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> with various lands, while the Triads connect the story directly with Llandaff, where "Lleirwg made the church which was the first in the isle of Britain". Further, somewhere in the eleventh century, as Liebermann has shown, a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> who had distinguished himself in other fields fabricated a letter which is supposed to have been sent by Pope Eleutherus to the British king.



<p>On the other hand, in contrast to this legendary matter, we have the generally accepted fact of the visit twice paid to Britain by <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a>, in 429 and 447, with the purpose of confuting the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, an object which seems to take for granted a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> already widely spread. The Life of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> by Constantius has been interpolated (cf. Lewison in "Neues Archiv", XIX), but much of this account belongs to the primitive redaction and is confirmed by Prosper of Aquitaine. Even the story of the "Alleluia Victory" and of the observance of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in substance, and the whole evidence sets before us a state of things in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was the prevailing and accepted religion. With this agrees all that we know of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and of his teaching. He was undoubtedly a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and it is difficult to believe that he could have adopted the monastic profession anywhere but in the land of his birth. Zimmer has maintained that <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> was an Irishman and that his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> found acceptance in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> rather than in Britain. But Zimmer's views have been severely criticized (cf. Williams in "Celtische Zeitschrift", IV, 1903, 527 sq.), and are not commonly admitted. Professor Williams, indeed, as against Conybeare (Cymmrodorion Transactions, 1897-98, 84-117), casts <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> upon the generally <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> character sometimes attributed to British <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and certainly the tone of the writings of Fastidius, described as a "Bishop of the Britons" (c. 420), is such as seems reconcilable with <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> interpretation.
<h2>The period of the Saxon conquest (A.D. 450-681)</h2>

<p>The writings of Gildas, usually assigned to the year 547, throw a fitful and somewhat lurid light upon British <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> during the earlier part of this period. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> something of the gloom of this jeremiad may be due to the idiosyncrasies of the writer. He seems to have belonged entirely by sympathy to the class, which after the departure of the legions, still preserved something of Roman culture. Also it is likely enough that the instability of all institutions, the stress and sufferings of a people continually harried and overmatched by invaders who were relatively barbarian, did produce an age of great moral degeneracy. Thus the vituperation with which Gildas lashes the vices of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> princes and denounces the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> has very probably serious foundation. But just as the tide of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> conquest was more than once checked, as for example by the British victory at the Mons Badonicus in 520, so there is reason to believe that there was a brighter side to the picture of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and disaster which Gildas paints with a zest which was more a matter of temperament than conviction. The succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was evidently kept up, as we learn subsequently from the history of St. Augustine. Monastic life at the same epoch would seem to have flourished exceedingly. From the fact that <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, as already noticed, was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and that <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> is said to have founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, it seems probable that some kind of cenobitical life had begun in Britain before the end of the fifth century. Possibly this departure was due to a disciple of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a> who settled in Britain, but more probably the British <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, who, as we learn from <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, made their way to the East to visit the Holy Land, brought back glowing accounts of what they had witnessed around <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a>. The strongly Oriental characteristics of the Celtic Rite as a whole are in all probability due to a similar cause. In any case, both such direct testimony as we possess and the parallel case of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> point to the practice of asceticism on a vast scale, and it is possible that the very calamities and evils of the times led the more religiously minded of the Britons to take refuge in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. It is alleged that <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> himself bestowed the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> on <a href="../cathen/07661a.htm">St. Illtyd</a>, who became the spiritual father of many <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and who founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Llantwit, where <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> like <a href="../cathen/13422c.htm">St. Samson</a> of Dol and St. Pol de Leon (who both ultimately settled in Brittany) as well as many other teachers of note were afterwards trained. But the whole province of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a> is overgrown with legend and with wildly inconsistent conjectures and identifications to an incredible extent. Beyond the name of a few leaders and founders, like Dubritius, believed to have been the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, David, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a> and patron of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">Kentigern</a>, whose chief work was accomplished on the banks of the Clyde, Asaph, who replaced him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> which now bears his name, Winefride the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and her uncle Beuno, etc., we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing practically certain of the age of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. We are not even sure of the date at which they lived. The object aimed at by the supposed Synods of Llandewi-Brefi (519-) and of Lucus Victoriae (569-), both said to have been convened to suppress <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, is equally a matter of conjecture. Regarding the spread of monasticism, such a statement as that of the Iolo <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, that at Llantwit "Illtyd founded seven churches, appointed seven companies for each church, and seven halls or colleges for each company and seven "saints" in each hall or college", does not inspire confidence. Yet we learn from the much safer authority of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> (Hist. Eccl., II, ii) that at Bangor-is-Coed in A.D. 613 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was divided into seven parts with a superior over each, none of which divisions contained fewer than 300 men. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> further tells us that when the Northumbrian King Ethelfrith advanced to attack the Britons near Chester these <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Bangor came out to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the success of the arms of their countrymen. When the Welshmen were defeated, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, twelve hundred in number, were put to the sword. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> looked upon the incident as a visitation of Providence to punish the Britons for rejecting the overtures of St. Augustine, but by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> chronicler <a href="../cathen/06655a.htm">Tigernach</a> the incident was remembered as "the battle in which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were massacred". Undoubtedly the most certain facts in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> history at this period are those just referred to, connecting St. Augustine with the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> twice committed the British Church to the care and authority of St. Augustine and the latter accordingly invited them to a conference upon the matters in which they departed from the approved Roman custom. They asked for a postponement, but at a second conference the seven British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present altogether refused to accept Augustine as their <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> or to conform in the matter of the disputed practices. The points mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> prove that the divergences could not have been at all fundamental. No matter of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> seems to have been involved, but the Britons were accused of using an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> cycle for determining <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, of defective <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (which may mean, it has been suggested, the omission of confirmation after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>), and thirdly of refusing to join with Augustine in any common action for the conversion of the Angles. There were also other peculiarities, as, for example, the form of the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and the sue of only one consecrator in consecrating <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as well as the employment of the Celtic Rite in the liturgy; but all these were matters of discipline only. None the less the failure of all attempts of conciliation was complete and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> attests that this attitude of hostility on the part of the British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> lasted down to his own day. It may have been partly as a result of this uncompromising <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the Saxons and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> identified with them, that we read during all this period of a more or less continual emigration of the Britons to Armorica, the modern Brittany. We hear about the year 470 of twelve thousand Britons who came by sea to settle in the country north of the Loire (Jonandes, "Getica", c. 45) and it is only in the sixth century apparently that the north-western regions of Gaul came to be called Britannia. The Gallo-Roman inhabitants of these districts welcomed the fugitives with much charity on account of their common <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> (Remodus, "Carmina III"), but the Britons requited them but ill, and seem to have behaved with the same ruthless tyranny of might over right which marked the conquests of the Anglo-Saxons in the land from which they had been driven. No doubt, as time went on, the British <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> like SS. Samson, Pol de Leon, Malo, Brioc, etc., who <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> with them, exercised a restraining effect upon the settlers, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Britanny seems to have been in a flourishing state from the sixth century onwards.
<h2>During the Saxon and Norman periods (681-1295)</h2>

<p>The last British titular King of Britain is said to have been "Cadwalader the blessed" who, according to the "Brut-y-Tywysogion", "died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 681 on the twelfth day of May; as Myrrdin had previously prophesied to Vortigern of repulsive lips; and henceforth the Britons lost the crown of he kingdom and the Saxons gained it". This <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is, however, generally held to be <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. Possibly there has been some confusion between Cadwalader of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and Caedwalla, King of Wessex, who undoubtedly did die in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 689. At a later date, however, journeys of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> princes to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> became common, that of Cyngen, King of Powys, in 854 being one of he earliest examples. During this whole period the political antagonism between Anglo-Saxons and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> seems always to have caused the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relations between the two countries to be strained, though the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> accepted the Roman <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> before the end of the eighth century, and though in 871 we hear of a Saxon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of St. Davids. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> also attempts were made to establish friendly relations. <a href="../cathen/01798a.htm">Asser</a>, the famous biographer of <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">King Alfred</a>, was a Welshman who came to the English court in 880, seeking protection from the tyranny of his native sovereigns, sons of Rhodri Mawr. This incident must be typical of many similar cases, and there were times, for example under Eadgar the Peaceable, when some sort of English suzerainty over the principality seems to have been acquiesced to. When Edgar was rowed on the Dee by eight under-kings in 973, five of the eight were <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a>, and this fact is even admitted by a <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a>, the compiler of the "Brut-y-Tywysogion", who, however, transfers the scene of the episode to Caerleon-upon-Usk. To detail the incidents of the six hundred years which preceded the final absorption of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> politically and ecclesiastically into the English system, which took place in the reign of Edward I, would not be possible here. It must be sufficient to note that even before the close of the Saxon period, various <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are alleged to have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> or confirmed by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, while under the Norman kings a direct claim to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the Welsh Church was made by various <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> beginning apparently with <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>. The most important matter to notice is that the attempt to claim for the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church any position independent of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is as futile as in the case of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> or ireland. Speaking primarily of the days of St. Augustine, the most recent and authoritative historian of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> remarks: "No <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> differences parted the Roman from the Celtic Church, for the notion that the latter was the home of a kind of primitive <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, of apostolic purity and simplicity, is without any historical basis. Gildas shows clearly enough that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to which he belonged held the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> current at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in his day as to the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">sacrifice of the Eucharist</a> and the privileged position of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>" (J.E. Lloyd, "Hist. of Wales", I, 173). And this remained <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> during the centuries which followed, as anyone who acquaints himself with such original sources as the chronicles, the Lives of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and especially the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> formulated in the Code of Howel the Good (A.D. 928), will readily perceive. In the preface of this same code we read that when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were drafted, Howel the Good and his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain the authority of the Pope of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. And there were read the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Howel in the presence of the Pope and the Pope was satisfied with them and gave them his authority" (Haddan and Stubbs, I, 219). In this code religious observations such as the veneration of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, the keeping of feasts and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, confession, Mass, and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are all taken for granted. The respect shown in the preface for the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is of special importance. So far as this respect was at any time less prominent, this is due, as J.E. Lloyd points out, to Celtic isolation, and not to any anti-Roman feeling. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionary Columbanus, "sturdy champion though he was of Celtic independence in matters ecclesiastical", nevertheless says of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>: "By reason of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> twin Apostles [Peter and Paul] you hold an all but celestial position and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is the head of the world's Churches, if exception be made of the singular privilege enjoyed by the place of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Our Lord's Resurrection</a>" (Hist. of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. I, 173). The rest of St. Columbanus's letter to <a href="../cathen/02660c.htm">Pope Boniface IV</a> (613) gives <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of an even more absolute dependence upon the guidance of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> whom he calls "our masters, the steersmen, the mystic pilots of the ship spiritual". It should perhaps be mentioned that the repudiation of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy attributed to Dinoth, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bangor-is-Coed, is now universally admitted to be a post-Reformation <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> (Haddan and Stubbs, I, 122), and cf. Gougaud, "Les chretientes celtiques", 211). Again the imputation, founded on a passage in the Gwentian text of the "Brut-y-Tywysogion" and suggesting that the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> was rejected on principle by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Welsh Church, runs counter to all the sounder evidence. Undoubtedly the gravest abuses prevailed in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> regarding this matter, but in principle <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">clerical celibacy</a> was accepted. The Gwentian text referred to is of no value as evidence; on the other hand the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Howel clearly assume that a married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was subject to penalty; his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was invalidated (Laws and Institutes of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, 595) and his children born subsequent to his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were held <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>. "When a clerk takes a wife by gift of kindred, and has a son by her, and afterwards the clerk takes <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders, and subsequently, when a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, has a son by the same <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the son previously begotten is not to share land with such a son, as he was begotten contrary to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>" (ib., 217 and 371).
