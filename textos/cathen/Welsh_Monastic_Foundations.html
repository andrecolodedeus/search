<h1>Welsh Monastic Foundations</h1>  

<p>Few <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the early British Church, as it existed before the Saxon invasion, are known to history; the names of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a>, SS. Julius and Aaron seem to be the only ones that have come down to us of the countless <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> slain in Britain in the time of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. But if we follow the British Church when driven into <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> in the fifth century, we meet at once with <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and scholars, whose names are little known to English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> became a home for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Within its borders there are no less than four hundred and seventy-nine villages and towns that derive their names from local Saints. Thus Llandewi marks the spot where St. David, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Caerleon and then of <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a> (fifth century) is said to have finally refuted <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>; Llangybi near Caerleon recalls the name of St. Cybi; Llanbadern near Aberystwith that of St. Padern; Beddgelert is associated with St. Celert; Llangattock with St. Cadoc; Lladudno with St. Tudno, etc. The old Celtic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> inclined for the most part to a great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life. Each locality seems to have its <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> who in his lonely <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> celebrated the Divine Mysteries (if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, recited the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> every day, and practised austerities.

<p>The arrival of <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a> in Britain (fifth century), to oppose the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">heresy of Pelagius</a>, seems to have given the first impetus to the formation of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. On his second visit, accompanied by St. Severus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, he established <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> throughout the land. These <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> soon became famous; those of <a href="../cathen/13201a.htm">Ross</a> and Hentlan on the Wye in Herefordshire alone contained one thousand scholars. "By means of these schools", says <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, "the Church continued ever afterwards pure in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and free from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>". The saint <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> St. Dubricius <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, and St. Iltutus (Iltyd) <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, recommending to them and others the multiplication and assiduous care of these <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were sacred learning was to be cultivated. Almost immediately a great development of monastic life took place and all over <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and monastic colleges arose which became renowned sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and homes of sacred learning.

<p>Llancarvan <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Glamorganshire, three miles from Cowbridge, and not far from the British Channel, was founded in the latter part of the fifth century by St. Cadoc (Dranc, "Christian Schools and Scholars", I, 56). He was the son of Gundleus (Swynlliw), a prince of South <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, who some years before his death renounced the world to lead an <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life near a country church which he had built. Cadoc, who was his oldest son, succeeded him in the government, but not long after followed his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> example and received the religious habit from St. Tathai, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, superior of a small community at Swent near Chepstow, in Monmouthshire. Returning to his native county, Cadoc built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which was called Llancarvan, or the "Church of the Stags". Here he established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and college, which became the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of many great and holy men. The spot at first seemed an impossible one, and almost inaccessible marsh, but he and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> drained and cultivated it, transforming it into one of the most famous and attractive religious homes in South <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. The plan of the building included a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. The ancient Iolo <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Welsh) gives an account of the numerical strength of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>: "The College of Cattwg [Cadoc] in Llancarvan with three cells [halls or subject houses] and a thousand <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> [<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>], together with two cells in the Vale of Neath" (Cambria Sacra, 388 sq.).

<p>St. Iltut (Illtyd) spent the first period of his <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> as a disciple of St. Cadoc at <a href="../cathen/09315b.htm">Llancarvan</a>. <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">St. Gildas</a> the Wise was invited by St. Cadoc to deliver lectures in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and spent a year there, during which he made a copy of a book of the Gospels, long treasured in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Cadoc. The <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> felt such reverence for this book that they used it in their most solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> and covenants. Seeing his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> thoroughly established, St. Cadoc visited several of the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> and colleges in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and then undertook a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (A.D. 462). From the latter city he brought home with him three altar-stones which had touched the Holy Sepulchre. He died at Benevenna (Weedon) in Northamptonshire in the beginning of the sixth century, leaving Ellenius his successor as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, "an excellent <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>", says Leland, "of an excellent master".

<p>Llaniltyd Vawr Monastery, also known as Llan-Iltut and  Llan-twit, situated on the sea-coast in Glamorganshire, not far from Llancarvan, was founded and governed for many years by St. Iltut (Iltyd), a noble Briton, who was a native of Glamorganshire, and a kinsman of King Arthur. It was St. Cadoc who inspired him with a contempt of the world and a thirst for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom. Iltut renounced his large possessions, received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> at the hands of St. Dubricius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, and then came as a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> disciple to place himself under the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of St. Cadoc at <a href="../cathen/09315b.htm">Llancarvan</a>. There he perfected himself in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and acquired great skill in sacred learning. He was subsequently <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>. It was probably by the advice of St. Cadoc that he left Llancarvan to found Llaniltyd, which became one of the most famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in Britain. Here the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> presided over a community of three thousand members, including many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and scholars of note, as St. David, <a href="../cathen/13422c.htm">St. Samson</a>, St. Magloire, <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">St. Gildas</a>, St. Pol de Leon, the bard Taliesin, and others. Here according to the Triads, an ancient authority on <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> never ceased, one hundred <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> being employed in chanting the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> throughout the day and night. Llaniltyd might rather be called a monastic <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> than a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of college. The Iolo <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (p. 556) gives us some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of its extent: "Here are the name of the cells [halls or subordinate colleges] of the college [collegiate <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>] of Iltyd, the colleges of St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, St. John, of Arthur, St. David, Morgan, Eurgain and Amwn. Of these colleges Iltyd was principal, and the place was named Bangor Iltyd and there were three thousand Saints [<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>]." St. Iltut while governing his immense community laboured with his own hands, and exercised himself in much watching, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Out of a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of holy retirement he passed three years in a lonely cave, in great austerity and assiduous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Before his death he took a journey to Brittany to visit his disciples and friends there, and died at Dole in the sixth century. He is to this day the titular saint of a church in Glamorganshire.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bangor of the Dee was known also as Bangor-is-Coed, i.e. "the eminent choir under the wood". The name Bangor was applied to several large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and is said to be derived from "Benedictus Chorus", shortened into Benchor, and subsequently written as Bangor. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Dee was distance about ten or twelve miles from <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, and its ruins witness to its former extent and importance. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> the Venerable (lib. II, c. ii.) says that it was filled with learned men at the coming of St. Augustine into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Of the founder of this religious house and its history little if anything seems to be known, as all its chronicles, documents, etc. have been lost or destroyed. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, of its tragic extinction about the year 603. While the forces of Cadvan, King of North <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, engaged those of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and usurping Edilfrid of Northumbria, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were assembled on an eminence a short distance from the place of conflict. "The two armies", says <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a>, "met in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>. On the summit of a neighbouring hill, Edilfrid espied an unarmed crowd, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Bangor, who, like Moses in the wilderness, had hoped by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to determine the fate of battle. "If they pray", exclaimed the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, "they fight against us"; and he ordered a detachment of his army to put them to the sword...Chester was taken, and Bangor (monastery) demolished. The scattered ruins demonstrated to subsequent generations the extent of that celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>" (Hist. Engl., II, 96). He adds in a note: "the number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> slain on the hill is generally said to have been twelve hundred; but <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> observes that others besides the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had assembled to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. He supposes that the victory of Edilfrid fulfilled the predictions of Augustine."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bangor (Benchor) near the Menai Straits owed its origin to St. Daniel, the fellow disciple of <a href="../cathen/07661a.htm">St. Illtut</a>. The place chosen was near the arm of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> that divides Anglesey from <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, where a city was soon afterwards built by King Mailgo, the same who undertook to defray the charges of <a href="../cathen/04640b.htm">St. David's</a> funeral. Of the number of religious we have no information; but judging from the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of this period in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, vocations much have been plentiful. The Iolo <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (p. 556) tells us that there were 3000 <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> [<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>] at Iltyd; 2000 in <a href="../cathen/05179a.htm">St. Dubricius's</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the banks of the Wye; 1000 in Llancarvan; 500 in St. David's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, 1000 in Elvan monastery, Glastonbury; and 1000 in that of St. Erilo, Llandaff. St. Daniel, the founder who had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by St. Dubricius, died about the year 545, and was buried in the Isle of Bardsey in the Atlantic near the extreme point of Carnavonshire. The soil of this island is hallowed by the remains of 20,000 <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>) buried there. (see Alban Butler, XI, 246.) The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Liancwlwy (St. Asaph) in the vale of Clwyd was founded by <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">St. Kentigern</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, who having been forced to quit his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> during the usurpation of Prince Rydderch's throne by one of the latter's rebellious nobles, took refuge in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, where, after visiting St. David at <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a>, he received from a <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> prince a grant of land for the erection of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> his community numbered about 995. These he divided into three companies; two, who were unlearned, were employed in agriculture and domestic offices; the third, which was made up of the learned, devoted their time to study and apostolic labours, and numbered upwards of three hundred. These again were divided into two choirs, one of which always entered the church as the others left, so that the praises of "God to all hours resounded in their mouths" (Britannia Sancta, I, 273). On the restoration of Rydderch in 544, <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">St. Kentigern</a> was recalled to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and left the government of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, his favourite scholar, whose name was afterwards conferred upon the church and diocese.

<p>St. Dubricius's <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were at Hentlan and Mochrhes on the River Wye. This <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a> by <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> about the year 444, and was afterwards appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Caerlcon, which dignity he resigned to St. David in 522 (Alban Butler, XI, 245). He erected two great <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, where <a href="../cathen/13422c.htm">St. Samson</a>, St. Thelian (Teilo), and many other eminent <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were trained in virtue and sacred learning. It is said that he had 1000 scholars with him for years at a time.

<p>St. David, his successor at Caerleon, founded twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>, having, according to an ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, a thousand <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In all these foundations he contrived to combine the hard work of the scholar and the equally hard labours of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Ploughing and grammar succeeded each other by turns.

<p>The course of studies at Llaniltyd (and this also applies to the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>) included Latin, Greek, rhetoric, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and mathematics. these were taught at Llaniltyd with so much success that it was looked upon as the first college in Britain (Cambria Sacra, pp. 436, 437).

<p>The Cambro-British <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> led a hard an austere life. "Knowing", says Capgrave (1514), "that secure rest is the nourisher of all vices [the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>] subjected the shoulders of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to hard wearisomeness...They detested riches and they had no cattle to till their ground, but each one was instead of an ox to himself and his brethren. When they had done their field work, returning to the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, they spent the rest of the day till evening in reading and writing. And in the evening at the sound of the bell, presently laying aside their work, and leaving even a letter unfinished, they went to the church and remained there till the stars appeared, and then all went together to table to eat, but not to fullness. Their food was bread with roots or herbs, seasoned with salt, and they quenched their thirst with milk mingled with water. Supper being ended they persevered about three hours in watching, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and genuflexions. After this they went to rest and at cock crowing rose again, and abode in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> till the dawn of day. Their only clothing was the skin of beasts."

<p>At Llan-Tweence, the monastic habit was a goat's skin worn over a hair shirt; the fare, a little barley bread, with water and a decoction of boiled herbs. <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days were distinguished by cheese and shell-fish, while a brief repose was taken on the bare earth, or the bark of trees for a bed with a stone for pillow.
