<h1>Wenzel Anton Kaunitz</h1>  

<p>An Austrian prince and statesman, born at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> 2 February, 1711; died there 27 June, 1794. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> had destined him for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the age of thirteen years he already held a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> at M&uuml;nster. Soon, however, he gave up the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of becoming an ecclesiastic, and studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Leipzig, and Leyden. He afterwards made an extensive <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> journey through <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was then made aulic councillor in 1735. At the German Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1739 he was one of the imperial commissaries. March, 1741, he was sent on a diplomatic mission to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and in August, 1742, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> ambassador at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. Two years later he was appointed minister plenipotentiary to the Government of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, in which capacity he was to all intents the actual ruler of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, because Archduchess Marianne, whom <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> had invested with the government of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, died a week after his arrival, and her husband, Prince Charles of Lorraine, was commanding the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> army in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> against the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. When <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> was taken after a three weeks siege by Maurice de Saxe on 20 February, 1746, Kaunitz went to <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and, when the French army followed him to that place, he left for Aachen, whence his urgent request to be recalled from his difficult position was finally heeded by the empress in June, 1746. In 1748he represented the interests of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> at the Congress of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, and reluctantly signed the treaty on 23 October, 1748. Extremely displeased at the treaty which deprived <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> of the provinces of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> and Glatz, guaranteeing them to <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, Kaunitz sought a way to regain these provinces and destroy the predominance of the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. He advocated an alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and, when sent as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in September, 1750, began to lay the foundation for this alliance, which, however, was not concluded until six years later. In 1753 he was recalled and became chancellor of state and minister of foreign affairs.

<p>Towards the end of 1755 he again began negotiations with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> concerning an anti-Prussian alliance. This time the circumstances were in his favour. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> felt itself slighted at the alliance into which <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had entered with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and a defensive alliance between <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, known as the Treaty of Versailles, was entered into on 1 May, 1756. This treaty, however, was only the preliminary to the so-called Second Treaty of Versailles, signed on 1 May, 1757; in this it was stipulated that the two powers would fight against the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, until Silesia and Glantz were restored to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. A similar alliance was effected with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> on 2 February, 1757. Both these alliances owed their existence to Kaunitz who was also practically the supreme manager of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> affairs during the ensuing Seven Years War. <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a> placed implicit reliance in his ability and devotion to his country, and no reform of any importance was undertaken during her rule, which did not originate from Kaunitz or at least bear the impress of his co-operation. In 1760 he founded the Austrian Council of State, consisting of six members, improved the financial management, and introduced various other governmental changes. In 1764 he was created a prince of the empire with the title of Count von Rittberg.

<p>The paramount influence which Kaunitz wielded during the reign of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> grew considerably less during the reign of her son, <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. In the main, <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> and Kaunitz pursued the same ends, viz. Territorial expansion, increase of the central state authority and limitation of the authority of the nobility, entire subjection of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the State, the supervision of the latter over the former even in the minutest ritual and disciplinary regulations, a better <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the common people, and more consideration for their legal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. But, despite the unity of their aims, they had numerous disagreements, because each was too opinionated to give up his views in deference to those of the other. In addition, Kaunitz was extremely vain and eccentric. He spent hours preparing his elaborate toilet at which he was assisted by a host of servants, having each a particular <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to perform. He manifested a childish fear of contagious diseases and could not bear to hear the word death or plague mentioned in his presence. Emperor Joseph in a letter to his brother Leopold, written about two weeks before his death, says of Kaunitz: "Would you believe that I have not seen him for almost two years. Since the day on which I returned sick from the army I can no longer go to him, and he does not come to me for fear of contagion." Despite his many faults, Kaunitz always had <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> welfare, as he understood it, at heart, and his long experience and cautiousness often put a wholesome restraint on the rash and impulsive disposition of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. He favoured the first Partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1772, was instrumental in obtaining Bukowina from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1775, and, though unsuccessful in his intended annexation of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1778, he obtained for <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> at the Peace of Teschen in May, 1779, the so-called <em>Innviertel</em>, i.e. that part of the territory of Berghausen which lies between the Danube, the Inn, and the Salza.

<p>In matters of religion Kaunitz was one of the foremost adherents of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement known as the "Enlightenment" (<em>Aufkl&auml;rung</em>). He even surpassed <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> in his endeavours to make the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> mere tools in the hands of state officials. When <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> visited <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1782, Kaunitz treated him very rudely and advised that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> be forbidden to come to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> while the pontiff was visiting there. He also counselled <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> on this occasion to make no concessions to the pontiff in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. He imbibed his deep <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as ambassador at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he had for some time Jean-Jacques Rousseau as private secretary. He was moreover a friend and great admirer of Voltaire and the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">French Encyclopedists</a>, whose works had become his chief <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> pabulum. His influence which was on the wane during the reign of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> grew still less during the reign of Leopold II (1790-2). At the accession of Francis II in 1792 he resigned as chancellor.
