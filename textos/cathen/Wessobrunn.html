<h1>Wessobrunn</h1>  

<p>(WESSOGONTANTUM, AD FONTES WESSONIS).

<p>A suppressed <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> near Weilheim in Upper <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. It was founded about 753 by Duke Tassilo and named after the duke's hunting companion Wesso who discovered a well at the present site of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. It was colonized by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Niederaltaich with Abbot Ilsung at their head. Under him was completed a church dedicated to Sts. Peter and Paul and he took part in the synod of Dingolfing in 770. His successor Adelmar (199-831) was present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in 817 and during his abbacy, Wessobrunn, which had originally belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Diocese of Brixen</a>, was joined to the <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a>. In 955 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was destroyed by the Hungarians, on which occasion Abbot Thiente and six of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, while the remaining three fled to Andechs with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a>. The Monastery was then occupied by canons until 1065 in which year the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> Adalbero restored the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> and governed as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> until his death in 1110. In the first year of his abbacy the monastic church was rebuilt and was dedicated by Bishop Embrico of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. Adalbero was succeeded by Sigihard (1110-28), during whose reign a separate church was built for the neighbouring people, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> in 1128. Under Bl. Waltho (1129-57) Wessobrunn enjoyed its first era of great spiritual and temporal prosperity. By rearing various tasteful edifices he gave the first impulse to unusual <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> activity and the cultivation of art for which Wessobrunn became famous in subsequent times. During his incumbency we find the earliest mention made of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> in connection with the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. It was here that Blessed Wulfhidis and the learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/04785c.htm">Diemoth</a> lived and died under his guidance. (Concerning him see "Monatsschrift des hist. Vereins von Oberbayern", I, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1892, 55 sq.) The three following centuries were periods of successive rise and decline. In 1401 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Wessobrunn were granted the right of pontifical insignia. A new era of great prosperity began with the accession of Ulrich Stocklin (1438-43), who had previously been a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/14471b.htm">Tegernsee</a> and acquired considerable fame as a writer of sacred <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. His rhymed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are highly finished and breathe a deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, though at times owing to their excessive length they become tedious. G.M. Dreves, who edited them in his "Analecta Hymnica", III, Vi, and XXXVIII, styles him "one of the most prolific rhythmic poets of the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>". Abbot Heinrich Zach (1498-2508) installed a printing press at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and Abbot Georg Uebelhor (1598-1607) founded the famous Wessobrunn <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of stucco-work from which issued the great masters Schmauzer (Matthias, Johann, Franz, and Joseph) and Zimmermann (Johann and Dominik). Towards the end of the seventeenth century Abbot Leonard Weiss (1671-96) began the rebuilding of the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in larger dimensions. This <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was also instrumental in the formation of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation in 1684 and joined his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to it. From the sixteenth century to the secularization of Wessobrunn in 1803, its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> displayed a continuous rare literary activity and some of them acquired fame as authors and teachers in various <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Among the best known are: the historians Stephan Leopolder (d. 1532) and Coclestin Leutner (d. 1759); the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> Thomas Ringmayr (d. 1652), Thomas Erhard (d. 1743), Veremund Eisvogl (d. 1761), Alphonse Campi (d. 1769), Ulrich Mittermayr (d. 1770), Virgil Sedlmayr (d. 1772), Sympert Schwarzhuber (d. 1795); the canonists <a href="../cathen/15745e.htm">Gregor Zallwein</a> (d. 1766) and Johann Kleinmayern (the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Wessobrunn, d. 1810); the Librarian and scientist Anselm Ellinger (d. 1816). Among these Leutner, Campi, Eisvogl, and Mittermayr collaborated in the edition of a large concordance of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> which was published in 1751. After its secularization in 1803 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> came into the possession of a certain De Montot. In 1810 the church was pulled down and used as building material at the neighbouring town of Weilheim. The remaining buildings were bought by Professor Sepp of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> in 1861 and since 1900 they have been the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of Baron von Cramer-Klett.

<p>Of special importance for the history of <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German literature</a> is the "Wessobrunn Prayer" (Das Wessobrunner Gebet), so called because it was discovered in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at Wessobrunn. It is a Saxon poem, copied in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> c. 800, and is one of the earliest literary remains of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>. It appears to have as its basis <a href="../bible/psa089.htm#vrs2">Psalm 89:2</a>, consists of nine alliterative lines, and is probably a quotation from a lost Biblical poem anterior to the "Heiland". To the poem is loosely attached a short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> dialect. It was edited by Mullenhoss-Schere, "Denkmaler deutscher Poesie und Prosa No. I", and by Kogel, "Geschichte der deutschen Literatur", I, I, 269-276.
