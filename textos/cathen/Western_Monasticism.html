<h1>Western Monasticism</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Pre-Benedictine period</h2>

<p>The introduction of monasticism into the West may be dated from about A.D. 340 when St. Athanasius visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> accompanied by the two <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> Ammon and Isidore, disciples of St. Anthony. The publication of the "Vita Antonii" some years later and its translation into Latin spread the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monachism widely and many were found in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to imitate the example thus set forth. The first <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> aimed at reproducing exactly what was done in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and not a few &#151; such as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, Rufinus, Paula, Eustochium and the two Melanias &#151; actually went to live in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> or Palestine as being better suited to monastic life than <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. As however the records of early Italian monasticism are very scanty, it will be more convenient to give first a short account of early monastic life in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is much more complete.
<h3 id="A">Gaul</h3>

<p>The first exponent of monasticism in Gaul seems to have been St. Martin, who founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/09247a.htm">Ligug&eacute;</a> near <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, c. 360 (see LIGUGE; <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">ST. MARTIN OF TOURS</a>). Soon after he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>; he then formed a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> outside that city, which he made his customary residence. Although only some two miles from the city the spot was so retired that Martin found there the solitude of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>. His cell was a hut of wood, and round it his disciples, who soon numbered eighty, dwelt in caves and huts. The type of life was simply the Antonian monachism of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">EASTERN MONASTICISM</a>) and so rapidly did it spread that, at St. Martin's funeral, two thousand <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were present. Even more famous was the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a> which gave to the <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Church of Gaul</a> some of its most famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In it the famous Abbot John Cassian settled after living for seven years among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and from it he founded the great Abbey of St. Victor of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. Cassian was undoubtedly the most celebrated teacher that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Gaul ever had, and his influence was all on the side of the primitive <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> ideals. Consequently we find that the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life was regarded as being the summit or goal of monastic <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and the means of perfection recommended were, as in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, extreme personal austerities with prolonged <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and vigils, and the whole atmosphere of ascetical endeavour so dear to the heart of the Antonian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03404a.htm">JOHN CASSIAN</a>; <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">FRANCE</a>; <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">ST. CAESARIUS OF ARLES</a>; LE&acute;RINS, etc.).
<h3 id="B">Celtic monasticism (Ireland, Wales, Scotland)</h3>

<p>Authorities are still divided as to the origin of Celtic monasticism, but the view most commonly accepted is that of Mr. Willis Bund which holds it to have been a purely indigenous growth and rejects the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of any direct connexion with Gallic or <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monasticism. It seems clear that the first Celtic <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were merely settlements where the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> lived together &#151; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children alike &#151; as a kind of religious clan. At a later period actual <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> both of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were formed, and later still the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life came into vogue. It seems highly probable that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and literature of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> or Gallic monachism may have influenced these later developments, even if the Celtic monasticism were purely independent in origin, for the external manifestations are identical in all three forms. Indeed the desire for austerities of an extreme character has always remained a special feature of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> asceticism down to our own time. Want of space forbids any detailed account of Celtic monasticism in this place but the following articles may be referred to: (for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>) <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">ARMAGH</a>, <a href="../cathen/02249b.htm">BANGOR</a>, CLONARD, <a href="../cathen/04064b.htm">CLONFERT</a>, CLONMACNOISE, <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">LISMORE</a>, <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">BOBBIO</a>, LUXEUIL, SAINTS PATRICK, <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">CARTHAGE</a>, <a href="../cathen/04137a.htm">COLUMBANUS</a>, <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">COMGALL</a>; (for <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>) <a href="../cathen/09315b.htm">LLANCARVAN</a>, <a href="../cathen/02249b.htm">BANGOR</a>, <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">SAINTS ASAPH</a>, <a href="../cathen/04640b.htm">DAVID</a>, <a href="../cathen/05179a.htm">DUBRIC</a>, <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">GILDAS</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">KENTIGERN</a>; (for <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>) <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">SCHOOL OF IONA</a>, <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">ABBEY OF LINDISFARNE</a>, <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">SAINTS NINIAN</a>, <a href="../cathen/04136a.htm">COLUMBA</a>, <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">AIDAN</a>. Undoubtedly, however, the chief glory of Celtic monasticism is its missionary work, the results of which are to be found all over northwestern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The observance, at first so distinctive, gradually lost its special character and fell into line with that of other countries; but, by that time, Celtic monasticism had passed its zenith and its influence had declined.
<h3 id="C">Italy</h3>

<p>Like the other countries of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> long retained a purely Eastern character in its monastic observance. The climate and other causes however combined to render its practice far harder than in the lands of its origin. In consequence the standard of observance declined, and it is clear from the Prologue to <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a> that by his day the lives of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> left much to be desired. Moreover there was as yet no fixed code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to regulate the life either of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or of the individual <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Each house had its own customs and practices, its own collection of rules dependent largely on the choice of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the moment. There were certainly in the West translations of various Eastern codes, e.g., the Rules of Pachomius and Basil and another attributed to Macarius. There were also St. Augustine's famous letter (Ep., ccxi) on the management of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and also the writings of Cassian, but the only actual Rules of Western origin were the two by St. Caesarius for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> respectively, and that by St. Columbanus, none of which could be called a working code for the management of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In a word monachism was still waiting for the man who should adapt it to Western needs and circumstances and give to it a special form distinct from that of the East. This man was found in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of St. Benedict (480-543).


<h2 id="section2">The spread of St. Benedict's Rule</h2>

<p>Full details of St. Benedict's legislation, which had such immense effects on the monasticism of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, will be found in the articles <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">ST. BENEDICT OF NURSIA</a> and <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">RULE OF ST. BENEDICT</a>. It is sufficient here to point out that St. Benedict legislated for the details of the monastic life in a way that had never been done before either in East or West. It is clear that he had acquainted himself thoroughly with the lives of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> fathers of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, with the writings of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, Cassian, and Rufinus; and in the main lines he has no intention of departing from the precedents set by these great authorities. Still the standard of asceticism aimed at by him, as was inevitable in the West, is less severe than that of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> or <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Thus he gives his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> good and ample food. He permits them to drink wine. He secures a sufficient period of unbroken sleep. His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was evidently to set up a standard that could and should be attained by all the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, leaving it to individual inspiration to essay greater austerities if the need of these were felt by any one. On the other hand, probably as a safeguard against the relaxations mentioned above, he requires a greater degree of seclusion than St. Basil had done. So far as possible all connexion with the world outside the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is to be avoided. If any <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> be compelled by <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to go beyond the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> enclosure he is forbidden on his return to speak of what he has seen or heard. So too no <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> may receive gifts or letters from his friends or relatives without permission of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that guests from without are to be received and entertained, but only certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> specially chosen for the purpose nay hold intercourse with them.

<p>Perhaps, however, the chief point in which St. Benedict modified the pre-existing practice is his insistence upon the <em>stabilitas loci</em>. By the special Vow of Stability he unites the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> for life to the particular <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in which his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are made. This was really a new development and one of the highest importance. In the first place by this the last vestige of personal freedom was taken away from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Secondly it secured in each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> that continuity of theory and practice which is so essential for the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which St. Benedict desired above everything. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was to be a father and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> a child. Nor was he to be more capable of choosing a new father or a new home than any other child was. After all St. Benedict was a Roman, and the scion of a Roman patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and he was simply bringing into the monastic life that absolute dependence of all the members of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> upon the father which is so typical of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> and usage. Only at the selection of a new <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> can the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> choose for themselves. Once elected the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> power becomes absolute; there is nothing to control him except the Rule and his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> which is responsible for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> entrusted to his care.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> was written at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> in the ten or fifteen years preceding the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death in 543, but very little is known of the way in which it began to spread to other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> (Dial., II, xxii) speaks of a foundation made from <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> at <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>, but nothing is known of this house. Again the traditions of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> foundations in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by <a href="../cathen/10072a.htm">St. Maurus</a> and St. Placid are now generally discredited. Still the Rule must have become known very soon, for by the death of St. Simplicius, the third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, in line from St. Benedict, it is referred to as being observed throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the year 580 <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> was destroyed by the Lombards and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, taking with them the autograph copy of the Rule. They were installed by <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>. It is almost certain that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> who succeeded <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> introduced the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> and observance into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Andrew which he founded on the Coelian Hill at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and also into the six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> he founded in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Thanks to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> the Rule was carried to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by St. Augustine and his fellow <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; and also to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> and Lombard <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> influence did much to revive. Indirectly too, by devoting the second book of his "Dialogues" to the story of St. Benedict's life and work, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> gave a strong impetus to the spread of the Rule. Thus the first stage in the advance of St. Benedict's code across Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> is closely bound up with the name of the first <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>-<a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>In the seventh century the process continued steadily. Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> code existed side by side with an older observance. This was the case at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a> where the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> lived either under the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a> or St. Columbanus, who had founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 609. In Gaul at the same period a union of two or more rules was often to be found, as at <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a>, Solignac, and elsewhere. In this there was nothing surprising, indeed the last chapter of St. Benedict's rule seems almost to contemplate such an arrangement. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, thanks to <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> of York, <a href="../cathen/02441b.htm">St. Benedict Biscop</a> and others, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> mode of life began to be regarded as the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> type of monachism. Its influence however was still slight in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> where the Celtic monasticism gave way more slowly. In the eighth century the advance of Benedictinism went on with even greater rapidity owing principally to the efforts of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. That saint is known as the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> although the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionaries had preceded him there. His energies however were divided between the two tasks of converting the remaining <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> tribes and bringing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> converts into line with the Roman use and obedience. In both these undertakings he achieved great success and his triumph meant the destruction of the earlier Columban form of monasticism. <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface's</a> institution, was modelled directly on <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> in which Sturm the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had resided for some time so that he might become perfectly acquainted with the workings of the Rule at the fountain head, and in its turn <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> became the model for all German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Thus by the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> form of monasticism had become the normal type throughout the West with the sole exception of some few Spanish and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>. So completely was this the case that even the memory of earlier things had passed away and it could be gravely <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of any kind at all had existed before St. Benedict and whether there could be any other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> but <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>.

<p>At the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> death in 814 the most famous <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was <a href="../cathen/02467a.htm">St. Benedict of Aniane</a>, the friend and counsellor of Louis the new emperor. For him Louis built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near his imperial palace at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, and there Benedict gathered thirty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, chosen from among his own personal friends and in full sympathy with his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was intended to be a model for all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of the empire, and the famous Assembly of 817 passed a series of resolutions which touched upon the whole range of the monastic life. The object of these resolutions was to secure, even in the minutest details, an absolute uniformity in all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the empire, so that it might seem as if "all had been taught by one single master in one single spot". As might have been expected the scheme failed to do this, or even anything approaching thereto, but the resolutions of the Assembly are of high interest as the first example of what are nowadays called "Constitutions", i.e. a code, supplementary to the Holy Rule, which shall regulate the lesser details of everyday life and practice. The growth of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> monasticism and its development during the period known as the "Benedictine centuries" will be found treated in the article <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">BENEDICTINES</a>, but it may be stated broadly that, while it had of course its periods of vigour and decline, no serious modification of St. Benedict's system was attempted until the rise of Cluny in the early part of the tenth century.
<h2 id="section3">The rise of Cluny</h2>

<p>The essential novelty in the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> system was its centralization. Hitherto every <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had been a separate <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, independent of all the rest. The ideal of Cluny, however, was to set up one great central <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with dependent houses, numbered even by the hundred, scattered over many lands and forming a vast <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> or monastic <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system under the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny. The superior of every house was nominated by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, every <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> was professed in his name and with his sanction. It was in fact more like an army subject to a general than St. Benedict's scheme of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> with a father to guide it, and for two centuries it dominated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> with a power second only to that of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> itself. (See CLUNY; <a href="../cathen/02512b.htm">ST. BERNO</a>; <a href="../cathen/11209a.htm">ST. ODO</a>; <a href="../cathen/07524a.htm">HUGH THE GREAT</a>.) Anything indeed more unlike the primitive monasticism with its caves and <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a> than this elaborate system with the pomp and circumstance which soon attended it could hardly be imagined, and the <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> which prompted men to become <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> soon began to tell against a type of monasticism so dangerously liable to relapse into mere formalism. It must be understood however that the observance of Cluny was still strict and the reaction against it was not based on any need for a reform in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> or discipline. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Cluny during the first two centuries of its existence, with the sole exception of Pontius (1109) who was soon deposed, were men of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and commanding ability. In practice however the system had resulted in crushing all initiative out of the superiors of the subordinate <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and so, when a renewal of vigour was needed there was no one capable of the effort required and the life was crushed out of the body by its own weight. That this defect was the real cause why the system failed is certain. Nothing is more remarkable in the history of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> monasticism than its power of revival by the springing up of renewed life from within. Again and again, when reform has been needed, the impetus has been found to come from within the body instead of from outside it. But in the case of Cluny such a thing had been rendered practically impossible, and on its decline no recovery took place.
<h2 id="section4">Reaction against Cluny</h2>

<p>The reaction against Cluny and the system of centralization took various forms. Early in the eleventh century (1012) came the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> by St. Romuald. This was a hark back to the ancient <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> ideal of a number of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> living in a "laura" or collection of detached cells which were situated some considerable distance apart (see <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">CAMALDOLESE</a>). A few years later (1039) St. John Gualbert founded the Order of Vallombrosa which is chiefly important for the institution of "lay brothers", as distinct from the choir <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, a novelty which assumes high importance in later monastic history (see LAY-BROTHER; VALLOMBROSA). In 1074 came the Order of Grammont which however did not move to the place from which its name is derived until 1124 (see GRAMMONT; <a href="../cathen/14291b.htm">ST. STEPHEN OF MURET</a>). Far more important than these was the establishment in 1084 of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> by <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, at the Grande Chartreuse near <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, which boasts that it alone of the great orders has never required to be reformed (see <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">CARTHUSIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/03636a.htm">LA GRANDE CHARTREUSE</a>; <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">ST. BRUNO</a>). In all these four institutes the tendency was towards a more <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> and secluded form of life than that followed by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, but this was not the case in the greatest of all the foundations of the period, viz. the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> derived their name from <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> near Dijon where the Order was founded about 1098 by <a href="../cathen/13097d.htm">St. Robert of Molesme</a>. The new development differed from that of Cluny in this that, while Cluny established one scattered <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of vast size, <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> preserved the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was an individual <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> but united all these <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> into one "Order" in the modern sense of an organized congregation. The Abbot and House of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> was to be pre-eminently for ever over all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the order. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of all the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were to assemble at <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> in general chapter every year. The purpose of this was to secure in every <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> a complete uniformity in the details of observance, and this uniformity was to be made even more certain by a yearly visitation of each house. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> possessed the further right of visiting any and every <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at will, and though he was not to interfere with the temporalities of any house against the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and brethren, in all matters of discipline his power was absolute. This elaborate system was set forth in the famous document known as the "Carta Caritatis" and in it for the first time the expression "Our Order" is used in the modern sense. Previously the word, as used in the phrase "the monastic order" had denoted the mode of life common to every <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In the "Carta Caritatis" it is used to exclude all monastic observance not exactly on the lines of the "new monastery", i.e., <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, and subject to it. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> spread over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> with surprising rapidity and from the colour of their habit the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were called the "White Monks", the older <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and Cluniacs being known as the "Black Monks" (see <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">CISTERCIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">CITEAUX</a>; <a href="../cathen/13097d.htm">ST. ROBERT OF MOLESME</a>; <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">ST. BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX</a>.)

<p>The impetus given by these new foundations helped to revitalize the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the older type, but at the same time a new influence was at work upon western monasticism. Hitherto the monastic ideal had been essentially contemplative. Certainly the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had undertaken active work of many kinds but always as a kind of accident, or to meet some immediate necessity, not as a primary object of their institute nor as an end in itself. Now however religious foundations of an active type began to be instituted, which were dedicated to some particular active work or works as a primary end of their foundation. Of this class were the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">Military Orders</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>; numerous Institutes of canons, e.g., Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, and Gilbertines; the many Orders of <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Trinitarians, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> or <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. Of these and the multitudinous modern foundations of an active character, as distinct from a contemplative or monastic one, this article does not profess to treat; they will be found fully dealt with in the general article RELIGIOUS ORDERS and also individually in separate articles under the names of the various orders and congregations. It must be recognized however that these active institutions attracted a vast number of vocations and to that extent tended to check the increase and development of the monastic order strictly so called, even while their fervour and success spurred the older institutes to a renewal of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in their special observances.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> in 1215 passed certain special canons to regulate monastic observance and prevent any falling away from the standard set up. These directions tended to adapt the best features of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> system, e.g. the general chapters, to the use of the Black <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and they were a great step in the path which later <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> so successful. At the time however they were practically ignored by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> on the Continent, and only in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was any serious effort made to put them into practice. The consequence was that the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Black <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> soon formed themselves into one national congregation, the observance throughout the country became largely uniform, and a far higher standard of life obtained than was common in continental <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at the same period. The system of periodic general chapters ordered by the Lateran Council was maintained. So too was the subjection of all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as a normal state of affairs; indeed only five <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were exempt from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. There were of course failures here and there, but it is clear that, from the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the Council of Lateran up to the time of their destruction, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> houses maintained on the whole a good standard of discipline and preserved the affectionate respect of the great majority of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in every rank of life.
<h2 id="section5">Period of monastic decline</h2>

<p>On the Continent the period succeeding the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> was one of steady decline. The history of the time tells of civil disturbance, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> upheaval, and a continual increase of luxury among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The wealth of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was tempting and the great ones both in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> seized upon them. Kings, nobles, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> obtained nominations to <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> "in commendam" and more often than not absorbed the revenues of houses which they left to go to ruin. Vocations grew scarce and not unfrequently the communities were reduced to a mere handful of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> living on a trifling allowance doled out to them none too willingly by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> or ecclesiastic who claimed to be their <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>. Efforts to check these evils were not wanting especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14372c.htm">Sylvestrines</a>, founded by St. Sylvester de Gozzolini about the middle of the thirteenth century, were organized on a system of perpetual superiors under one head, the Prior of Monte Fano, who ruled the whole congregation as general assisted by a chapter consisting of representatives from each house (see <a href="../cathen/14372c.htm">SYLVESTRINES</a>). The <a href="../cathen/16020a.htm">Celestines</a>, founded about forty years later by <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">St. Peter Morone (Celestine V)</a>, were organized on much the same plan but the superiors were not perpetual and the head of the whole body was an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> elected by the General Chapter for three years and ineligible for reelection for nine years after his previous term of office (see <a href="../cathen/16020a.htm">CELESTINES</a>; <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">ST. CELESTINE V</a>). The <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>, founded about 1313 by Bernardo Tolomei of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, mark the last stage of development. In their case the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were not professed for any particular <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but, like <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, for the congregation in general. The officials of the various houses were chosen by a small committee appointed for this purpose by the general chapter. The abbot-general was visitor of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and "superior of superiors", but his power was held for a vary short period only. This system had the very great advantage that it rendered the existence of commendatory superiors practically impossible, but it secured this at the cost of sacrificing all <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life in the individual <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which is the central <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of St. Benedict's legislation. Further, by taking the right of election away from the monastic communities, it concentrated all real power in the hands of a small committee, a course obviously open to many possible dangers (see <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">OLIVETANS</a>).
<h2 id="section6">Monastic revival</h2>

<p>In the great wave of reform and revival which characterized the later fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the older institutions of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> once more gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their vitality and a spontaneous renewal of vigour was shown throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. This revival followed two main lines. In the Latin countries the movement pursued the path marked out by the <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>. Thus in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Black <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were gradually united together under the name of the Congregation of St. Justina of Padua, afterwards called the Cassinese Congregation (see under <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">BENEDICTINES</a>). Similar methods were adopted in the formation of the Congregations of St. Maur and St. Vannes in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in the two Congregations of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and in the revival of the English Congregation. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the revival took a different path; and, while keeping closer to the traditions of the past, united the existing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> very much in the manner ordered by the Fourth Council of Lateran in 1215. The Union of Bursfeld is perhaps the best example of this method. An example of reform in the seventeenth century was the work of Abb&eacute; de Rance in instituting the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> reform at <a href="../cathen/09035a.htm">La Trappe</a>. In this his object was to get as close as possible to the principal form of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> life. No one can question his sincerity or the singleness of his intentions, but de Rance was not an antiquary and had not been trained as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> but as a courtier. The result was that he interpreted St. Benedict's rule with the most absolute literalness, and thus succeeded in producing a cast-iron mode of life far more rigid and exacting than there is any reason to believe St. Benedict himself either desired to or did beget. The upheaval of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which followed it seemed likely to give a deathblow to Western monasticism and in fact did destroy <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> by the hundred. But nothing perhaps is more noteworthy, in all the wonderful revival of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> which the last hundred years have seen, than the resuscitation of monastic life in all its forms, not only in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, but also in America, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and other distant lands whose very existence was unknown to the founders of Western monasticism. Details of this revival will be found in the articles on the various orders and congregations referred to above.

<p>No mention has been made in this article of the question of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> under monasticism. Broadly speaking the history of contemplative <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, as distinct from <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the more recent active orders, has been identical with that of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In almost every instance the modifications, reforms, etc., made by the various monastic legislators have been adopted by <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as well as by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In cases where any special treatment has been thought <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, a separate section of the article on the order or congregation in question has been dedicated to the subject. These sections should be referred to in all cases for detailed information.
