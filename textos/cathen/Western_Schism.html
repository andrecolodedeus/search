<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Western Schism</h1>  

<p>This <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries differs in all points from the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Eastern Schism</a>. The latter was a real revolt against the supreme authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, fomented by the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Constantinople, favoured by the Greek emperors, supported by the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, and lasting nine centuries. The Western Schism was only a temporary misunderstanding, even though it compelled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for forty years to seek its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> head; it was fed by politics and passions, and was terminated by the assembling of the councils of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a>. This religious division, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> less serious than the other, will be examined in its origin, its developments, the means employed to end it, and its ending in 1417 by the election of an undisputed <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. From a legal and apologetic standpoint what did the early <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> think of it? What is the reasoned opinion of modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists? Was the real <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to be found at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> or at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>?

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Pope Gregory XI</a> had left <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and had re-established the pontifical see in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, where he died on 27 March, 1378. At once attention was directed to the choice of his successor. The question was most serious. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, nobles, and the Romans in general were interested in it, because on the election to be made by the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> depended the residence of the future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> or at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Since the beginning of the century the pontiffs had fixed their abode beyond the Alps; the Romans, whose interests and claims had been so long slighted, wanted a Roman or at least an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The name of Bartolommeo Prignano, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, was mentioned from the first. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> had been Vice-Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and was regarded as the enemy of vice, <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, and display. His <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> were exemplary and his integrity rigid. He was regarded by all as eligible. The sixteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> present at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> met in <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> on 7 April, and on the following day chose Prignano. During the election disturbance reigned in the city. The people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the vicinity, turbulent and easily roused, had, under the sway of circumstances, loudly declared their preferences and antipathies, and endeavoured to influence the decision of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Were these facts, regrettable in themselves, sufficient to rob the members of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> freedom of mind and to prevent the election from being valid? This is the question which has been asked since the end of the fourteenth century. On its solution depends our opinion of the legitimacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. It seems certain that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> then took every means to obviate all possible <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>. On the evening of the same day thirteen of them proceeded to a new election, and again chose the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> with the formally expressed intention of selecting a legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. During the following days all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> offered their respectful homage to the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who had taken the name of <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, and asked of him countless favours. They then <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> him, first at the Vatican Palace, and later at St. John Lateran; finally on 18 April they solemnly <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him at St. Peter's. On the very next day the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> gave official notification of <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban's</a> accession to the six <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; the latter recognized and congratulated the choice of their colleagues. The Roman <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> then wrote to the head of the empire and the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns. <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Cardinal Robert of Geneva</a>, the future <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Clement VII of Avignon</a>, wrote in the same strain to his relative the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and to the Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Pedro de Luna</a> of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, the future <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, likewise wrote to several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.

<p>Thus far, therefore, there was not a single objection to or dissatisfaction with the selection of Bartolommeo Prignano, not a protest, no hesitation, and no fear manifested for the future. Unfortunately <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Pope Urban</a> did not realize the hopes to which his election had given rise. He showed himself whimsical, haughty, suspicious, and sometimes choleric in his relations with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who had elected him. Too obvious roughness and blameable extravagances seemed to show that his unexpected election had altered his character. <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>, with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, did not hesitate to make him some very well-founded remarks in this respect, nor did she hesitate when there was question of blaming the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in their revolt against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> whom they had previously elected. Some historians state that <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban</a> openly attacked the failings, real or supposed, of members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, and that he energetically refused to restore the pontifical see to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Hence, they add, the growing opposition. However that may be, none of these unpleasant dissensions which arose subsequently to the election could <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> weaken the validity of the choice made on 8 April. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> elected Prignano, not because they were swayed by fear, though naturally they were somewhat fearful of the mischances that might grow out of delay. <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban</a> was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> before his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; he was still <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> after his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. The passions of King Henry IV or the vices of Louis XV did not prevent these monarchs from being and remaining <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> descendants of St. Louis and lawful kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Unhappily such was not, in 1378, the reasoning of the Roman <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Their dissatisfaction continued to increase. Under pretext of escaping the unhealthy heat of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, they withdrew in May to <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, and in July to Fondi, under the protection of Queen Joanna of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and two hundred Gascon lances of Bernardon de la Salle. They then began a silent campaign against their choice of April, and prepared men's minds for the news of a second election. On 20 September thirteen members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> precipitated matters by going into <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> at Fondi and choosing as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Robert of Geneva</a>, who took the name of <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>. Some months later the new pontiff, driven from the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, took up his residence at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was complete.



<p><a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> was related to or allied with the principal royal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; he was influential, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and skilful in politics. <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> was quickly divided into two almost equal parties. Everywhere the faithful faced the anxious problem: where is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>? The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> themselves were divided: St <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">Catherine of Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/03448a.htm">St. Catherine of Sweden</a>, Bl. Peter of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, Bl. Ursulina of Parma, Philippe d'Alencon, and <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Gerard de Groote</a> were in the camp of <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban</a>; St. Vincent Ferrer, Bl. Peter of Luxemburg, and <a href="../cathen/04099b.htm">St. Colette</a> belonged to the party of <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement</a>. The century's most famous <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of law were consulted and most of them decided for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> were divided. Germans like Henry of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> or Langstein (<em>Epistola concilii pacis</em>) and Conrad of Glenhausen (<em>Ep. brevis; Ep. Concordioe</em>) inclined towards <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban</a>; Pierre d'Ailly, his friend Philippe de Maizieres, his pupils <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Jean Gerson</a> and <a href="../cathen/04011b.htm">Nicholas of Clemanges</a>, and with them the whole School of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, defended the interests of <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement</a>. The conflict of rival passions and the novelty of the situation rendered understanding difficult and unanimity impossible. As a general thing scholars adopted the opinion of their country. The powers also took sides. The greater number of the Italian and German states, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> supported the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope of Rome</a>. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and all the nations in the orbit of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Nevertheless Charles V had first suggested officially to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a> the assembling of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, but he was not heard. Unfortunately the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> launched <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against each other; they created numerous <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to make up for the defections and sent them throughout <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> to defend their cause, spread their influence, and win adherents. While these grave and burning discussions were being spread abroad, <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> had succeeded <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> had been elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at the death of <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement of Avignon</a>. "There are two masters in the vessel who are fencing with and contradicting each other", said Jean Petit at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1406). Several <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> assemblies met in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and elsewhere without definite result. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> continued without remedy or truce. The King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and his uncles began to weary of supporting such a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as Benedict, who acted only according to his humour and who caused the failure of every plan for union. Moreover, his exactions and the fiscal severity of his agents weighed heavily on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and lesser <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Charles VI released his people from obedience to Benedict (1398), and forbade his subjects, under severe penalties, to submit to this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Every bull or letter of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was to be sent to the king; no account was to be taken of privileges granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; in future every <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> was to be asked of the ordinaries.

<p>This therefore was a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> within a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, a law of separation. The Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who was already viceroy during the illness of Charles VI, thereby became even vice-pope. Not without the connivance of the public power, Geoffrey Boucicaut, brother of the illustrious marshal, laid siege to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and a more or less strict blockade deprived the pontiff of all communication with those who remained faithful to him. When restored to liberty in 1403 Benedict had not become more conciliating, less obstinate or stubborn. Another private synod, which assembled in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1406, met with only partial success. <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a> had already succeeded <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface of Rome</a>, and, after a reign of two years, was replaced by <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>. The latter, although of temperate character, seems not to have realized the hopes which <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, immeasurably wearied of these endless divisions, had placed in him. The council which assembled a <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> added a third claimant to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne instead of two (1409). After many conferences, projects, discussions (oftentimes violent), interventions of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a>, catastrophes of all kinds, the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1414) deposed the suspicious <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, received the abdication of the gentle and timid <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, and finally dismissed the obstinate <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. On 11 November, 1417, the assembly elected Odo Colonna, who took the name of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. Thus ended the great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the West.

<p>(2) From this brief summary it will be readily concluded that this <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> did not at all resemble that of the East, that it was something unique, and that it has remained so in history. It was not a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> properly so called, being in reality a deplorable misunderstanding concerning a question of fact, an historical complication which lasted forty years. In the West there was no revolt against <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority in general, no scorn of the sovereign power of which St. Peter was the representative. Faith in the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> unity never wavered a particle; no one wished <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to separate from the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now this intention alone is the characteristic mark of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> spirit (Summa, II-II, Q. xxxix, a. 1). On the contrary everyone desired that unity, materially overshadowed and temporarily compromised, should speedily shine forth with new splendour. The <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, canonists, princes, and faithful of the fourteenth century felt so intensely and maintained so vigorously that this character of unity was essential to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church of Jesus Christ, that at <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> solicitude for unity took precedence of that for reform. The benefit of unity had never been adequately appreciated till it had been lost, till the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had become bicephalous of tricephalous, and there seemed to be no head precisely because there were too many. Indeed the first mark of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church consists above all in unity under one head, the Divinely appointed guardian of the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of worship. Now in practice there was then no wilful <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> regarding the necessity of this character of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, much less was there any culpable revolt against the known head. There was simply <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and among the greater number invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, regarding him who was at that time the visible depositary of the promises of the invisible Head. How indeed was this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to be dispelled? The only witnesses of the facts, the authors of the double election, were the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of 1378 held successive opinions. They had in turn testified for <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> elected, on 8 April, and for <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement of Avignon</a> on 20 September. Who were to be believed? The members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, choosing and writing in April, or the same <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> speaking and acting contradictorily in September? Fondi was the starting point of the division; there likewise must be sought the serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and formidable responsibilities.

<p>Bishops, princes, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and canonists were in a state of perplexity from which they could not emerge in consequence of the conflicting, not disinterested, and perhaps insincere testimony of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Thenceforth how were the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to dispel uncertainty and form a morally sure opinion? They relied on their natural leaders, and these, not knowing exactly what to hold, followed their interests or passions and attached themselves to probabilities. It was a terrible and distressing problem which lasted forty years and tormented two generations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the course of which there was no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> intention, unless exception perhaps be made of some exalted <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who should have considered the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> before all else. Exception should also be made of some <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the period whose extraordinary opinions show what was the general disorder of minds during the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (N. Valois, I, 351; IV, 501). Apart from these exceptions no one had the intention of dividing the seamless robe, no one formally desired <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; those concerned were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> or misled, but not culpable. In behalf of the great majority of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people must be pleaded the <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> which excludes all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and the wellnigh impossibility for the simple faithful to reach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This is the conclusion reached by a study of the facts and contemporary documents. This King Charles V, the Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, the Duke of Brittany, and <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Jean Gerson</a>, the great chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, vie with one another in declaring. D'Ailly, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> echoed the same moderate and conciliatory sentiments. In 1409 he said to the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no schismatics save those who stubbornly refuse to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or who after discovering it refuse to submit to it, or who still formally declare that they do not want to follow the movement for union". Schism and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and vices, he adds in 1412, can only result from stubborn opposition either to the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, or to an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a>. This is the pure <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> (cf. Tshackert, "Peter von Ailli", appendix 32, 33).

<p>(3) Most modern <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> uphold the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. It suffices to quote Canon J. Didiot, dean of the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>: "If after the election of a pope and before his death or resignation a new election takes place, it is null and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>; the one elected is not in the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic Succession</a>. This was seen at the beginning of what is called, somewhat incorrectly, the Great Schism of the West, which was only an apparent <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> from a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> standpoint. If two elections take place simultaneously or nearly so, one according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> previously passed and the other contrary to them, the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> legally chosen and not to the other, and though there be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>, discussions, and cruel divisions on this point, as at the time of the so-called Western Schism, it is no less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, no less real that the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a> exists objectively in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. What does it matter, in this objective relation, that it is not manifest to all and is not recognized by all till long after? A treasure is bequeathed to me, but I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether it is in the chest A or in the casket B. Am I any less the possessor of this treasure?" After the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> let us hear the canonist. The following are the words of <a href="../cathen/02711e.htm">Bouix</a>, so competent in all these questions. Speaking of the events of this sad period he says: "This dissension was called <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, but incorrectly. No one withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> considered as such, but each obeyed the one he regarded as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. They submitted to him, not absolutely, but on condition that he was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Although there were several obediences, nevertheless there was no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> properly so-called" (De Papa, I, 461).

<p>(4) To contemporaries this problem was, as has been sufficiently shown, almost insoluble. Are our lights fuller and more brilliant than theirs? After six centuries we are able to judge more disinterestedly and impartially, and apparently the time is at hand for the formation of a decision, if not definitive, at least better informed and more just. In our opinion the question made rapid strides towards the end of the nineteenth century. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, Bliemetzrieder, Hefele, Hinschius, Kraus, <a href="../cathen/03004a.htm">Br&uuml;ck</a>, Funk, and the learned Pastor in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Marion, Chenon, de Beaucourt, and <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Kirsch in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, Palma, long after Rinaldi, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Albers in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (to mention only the most competent or illustrious) have openly declared in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Noel Valois, who assumes authority on the question, at first considered the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, and believed "that the solution of this great problem was beyond the judgment of history" (I,8). Six years later he concluded his authoritative study and reviewed the facts related in his four large volumes. The following is his last conclusion, much more explicit and decided than his earlier judgment: "A tradition has been established in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which historical investigation tends to confirm". Does not this book itself (IV, 503), though the author hesitates to decide, bring to the support of the Roman thesis new arguments, which in the opinion of some critics are quite convincing? A final and quite recent argument comes from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1904 the "Gerarchia Cattolica", basing its arguments on the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a>, compiled a new and corrected list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a>. Ten names have disappeared from this list of legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, neither the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> nor those of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> being ranked in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> lineage of St. Peter. If this deliberate omission is not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> positive, it is at least a very strong presumption in favour of the legitimacy of the Roman <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>. Moreover, the names of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, were again taken by later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries) who were legitimate. We have already quoted much, having had to rely on ancient and contemporary testimonies, on those of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as on those of the nineteenth and even the twentieth, but we shall transcribe two texts borrowed from writers who with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are at opposite poles. The first is Gregorovius, whom no one will suspect of exaggerated respect for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Concerning the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> divisions of the period he writes: "A temporal kingdom would have succumbed thereto; but the organization of the spiritual kingdom was so wonderful, the ideal of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> so indestructible, that this, the most serious of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>, served only to demonstrate its indivisibility" (Gesch. der Stadt Rom im Mittelalter, VI, 620). From a widely different standpoint <a href="../cathen/09554a.htm">de Maistre</a> holds the same view: "This scourge of contemporaries is for us an historical treasure. It serves to prove how immovable is the throne of St. Peter. What human organization would have withstood this trial?" (Du Pape, IV, conclusion).
