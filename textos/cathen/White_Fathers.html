<h1>White Fathers</h1>  

<p>(MISSIONARIES OF OUR LADY OF AFRICA OF ALGERIA).

<p>This <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, known under the name of "P&egrave;res Blancs" or "White Fathers", was founded in 1868 by the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, later <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a>. The famine of 1867 left a large number of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian instruction</a> of these children was the occasion of the founding of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; but from its inception the founder had in mind the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> of Central Africa. Missionary posts were established in Kabylic and in the Sahara. In 1876 and in 1881 two caravans from South Algeria and R'dames, intending to open missions in Soudan, were massacred by their guides. In 1878 ten missionaries left Algiers to establish posts at Lakes Victoria Nyanza and Tanganyika. These now form the present <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariates Apostolic</a> of Northern Nyanza, Southern Nyanza, Unyanyembe, Tanganyika, Nyassa, and Upper Congo. In 1894 the mission of French Soudan was founded. The missions of the Sahara are grouped in a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>. In 1880, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the White Fathers established at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a Greek <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the formation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of this rite. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is composed of missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and coadjutor brothers. The members are bound by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> engaging them to labour for the conversion of Africa according to the constitutions of their <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The missionaries are not, strictly speaking, a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, and may retain their own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; but they may expend it in the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> only at the direction of the superiors. One of the chief points in the rule is in regard to community life in the missions, each house being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contain not less than three members. At the head of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is a superior-general, elected every six years by the chapter. He resides at Maison-Carree, near Algiers. Those desiring to become <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are admitted to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> after their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, and one year of general <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. The three last years are spent at the scholasticate of Carthage in <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> admits <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of all nationalities. Recruiting houses are found in Quebec (Canada), <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in which are received those not yet ready for the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. The costume of the missionaries resembles the white robes of the Algerian <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and consists of a cassock or <em>gandoura</em>, and a mantle or <em>burnous</em>. A <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> and cross are worn around the neck in imitation of the <em>mesbaha</em> of the marabouts. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> depends directly on the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>. The White Fathers succeeded in establishing small missions among the Berbers of Jurjura (Algeria), there being at present nine hundred and sixty-two <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; but the regions bordering on the great lakes and Soudan show the best results. The number of <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> in all the vicariates (June, 1909) was 135,000; the number preparing for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> 151,480. A test of four years is imposed on those desiring to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. To religious instruction the missionaries add lessons in reading and writing, and teach also, in special classes, the tongue of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nation governing the country. The brothers form the young blacks for trades and agriculture. The number of boys in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (June, 1909) was 22,281. In July, 1910, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> numbered; 600 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 250 brothers; 70 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, with 80 pupils in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> classes. In the houses of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> were 72 pupils.
