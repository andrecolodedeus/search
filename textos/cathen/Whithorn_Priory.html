<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Whithorn Priory</h1>  

<p>Located in Wigtownshire, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, founded about the middle of the twelfth century, in the reign of David I, by Fergus, Lord of <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a>, for <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian, or White, Canons</a>. The canons of Whithorn formed the chapter of the <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Diocese of Galloway</a>, which was re-established about the same time, also by Fergus, the old succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> having died out about 796. The prior stood next in rank to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as we see from the order of signatories to an espiscopal charter early in the thirteenth century; and he and his community enjoyed the right of electing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, although this right was occasionally overruled in favour of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, of which see Galloway was a suffragan for several centuries. The full list of <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> has not been preserved; among them were: Maurice, who <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> fealty to King Edward I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1296; Gavin Dunbar (1514), who rose to be <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>; and <a href="../cathen/02374a.htm">James Beaton</a>, successively <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a> and of St. Andrews, and chancellor of the kingdom. Whithorn was long a noted place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, owing to its connection with the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> memory of <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">St. Ninian</a>. Many Scottish sovereigns, among them Margaret (queen of James III), James IV, and James V, made repeated <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> shrine, and left rich offerings behind them. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, thus endowed, became opulent, and its income at the dissolution was estimated at over &#163;1000. The last prior (Fleming) was committed to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in 1563 for the crime of saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. The whole <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> was vested in the Crown by the annexation act of 1587, and was granted in 1606 by James VI to the occupant of the <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">See of Galloway</a> when he established Episcopalianism in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> in 1606. It continued to belong to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> until the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">revolution of 1688</a>, at which date that see was the richest in the kingdom next to St. Andrews and <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> church, which served also as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, had a long <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> without <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, a choir of about the same length, and a lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> beyond. In 1684 the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and western tower were still intact; but the existing remains consist only of the roofless <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and the extensive vaulted <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypts</a> constructed under the eastern end of the church. Such restoration as was possible has been carefully carried out by the <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">third Marquis of Bute</a>.
