<h1>Widow</h1>  

<p>I. Canonical prescriptions concerning widows in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> refer mainly to the question of remarriage. If a man died without children, his widow was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to marry her deceased husband's brother, and if the latter refused to take her to wife he was put to shame before the people (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#vrs5">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). The high- <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was forbidden to marry a widow (<a href="../bible/lev021.htm#vrs14">Leviticus 21:14</a>), but other members of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were at liberty to take to wife the widow of another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but not the widow of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> (<a href="../bible/eze044.htm#vrs22">Ezekiel 44:22</a>). Outside of these prescriptions, there is no law in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> restricting a widow's remarriage. The support of widows was commended to the charity of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, and they were to have the gleanings of the cornfields, olive trees, and vineyards (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#vrs19">Deuteronomy 24:19-22</a>). In the third year of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> (or the great <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>) widows were to have their share of the offering (<a href="../bible/deu026.htm#vrs12">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>), and at the three principal solemnities of the year they were to be invited to feast with the nearest house-holder (<a href="../bible/deu016.htm#vrs11">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>). In the times of the Machabees money was deposited and provisions were kept in the Temple at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> for the subsistence of widows (<a href="../bible/2ma003.htm#vrs10">2 Maccabees 3:10</a>), and the spoils of battle were also shared with them (<a href="../bible/2ma008.htm#vrs28">2 Maccabees 8:28</a>). For their protection, there was a prohibition against taking their garments in pawn (<a href="../bible/deu024.htm#vrs17">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>). In the Book of Job the taking away of a widow's ox for a pledge is considered a wicked action (xxiv,3), from which commentators generally gather that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Deuteronomy was later extended to all a widow's possessions. Besides legal prescriptions for the protection of widows, the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> contains many general <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> commending them to the reverence and benevolence of the chosen people and bitter denunciations of their oppressors and defrauders. The lot of the widow in <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> times was generally a hard one, and Christ refers to the widow's mite as an offering from the poorest of the poor (<a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs44">Mark 12:44</a>). He also strongly denounces the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>: "because you devour the houses of widows" (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs14">Matthew 23:14</a>). Under the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Dispensation</a> some widows devoted themselves to a life of special religious observance, as is recorded of Anna the Prophetess, "who departed not from the temple by fastings and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> serving night and day" (Luke ii, 37).

<p>II. In primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times the support of widows was made a special <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, who collected <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for them and gave care of them to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs1">Acts 6:1</a>). This support of needy widows has always been considered a particular charge of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> and many <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils make mention of it as specially incumbent on <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and holders of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. In <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> times widows were employed in certain capacities in the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, directing that one to be chosen must be "of no less than threescore years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband. Having testimony for her good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>", and some see in this reference to the order of <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a>, while others do not. Shortly after, however, the office of <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> was referred to as "widowhood" (St. Ignatius, <a href="../fathers/0109.htm"><em>Smyrn&aelig;ans</em> 8.1</a>). As to the remarriage of widows in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, though <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> declares that widowhood is preferable to the married state (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 7:8</a>), yet he does not forbid remarriage (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs39">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>). Second nuptials are valid by ecclesiastical law if the first marriage bond has been really dissolved and if there is no <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">canonical impediment</a>, as is the case for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in major orders in the Oriental rites. In the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, second nuptials are less honourable than a first marriage (<a href="../fathers/3802.htm">Council of Ancyra, canon 19</a>; <a href="../fathers/3806.htm">Council of Laodicea, canon 1</a>), and the state of widowhood is more commendable (Conc. Trid., sess. xxiv, de matr., can. 10) as a more perfect good. (See <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">WOMAN</a>.)
