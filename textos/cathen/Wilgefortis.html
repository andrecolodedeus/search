<h1>Wilgefortis</h1>  

<p>A fabulous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> known also as UNCUMBER, KUMMERNIS, KOMINA, COMERA, CUMERANA, HULFE, ONTCOMMENE, ONTCOMMER, DIGNEFORTIS, EUTROPIA, REGINFLEDIS, LIVRADE, LIBERATA, etc.

<p>The legend makes her a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> daughter of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. In order to keep her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity, she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to disfigure her body, that she might evade the command of her father to marry a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> prince. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> caused a <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> to grow on her chin, whereupon her father had her crucified. Connected with this legend is the story of a destitute fiddler to whom, when he played before her image (or before her crucified body), she gave one of her golden boots. Being condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> for the theft of the boot, he was granted his request to play before her a second time, and, in presence of all, she kicked off her other boot, thus establishing his innocence.

<p>The legend is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> adaptation of the Hermaphroditus of Greek mythology or of other androgynous myths of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquity, as it cannot be traced back further than the fifteenth century. It rather originated from a misinterpretation of the famous "Volto Santo" of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, a representation of the crucified Saviour, clothed in a long tunic, His eyes wide open, His long hair falling over His shoulders, and His head covered with a crown. This crucifix, popularly believed to be the work of Nicodemus, is preserved in the Basilica of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> and highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the people. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was common to represent Christ on the cross clothed in a long tunic, and wearing a royal crown; but since the eleventh century this practice has been discontinued. Thus it happened that copies of the "Volto Santo" of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, spread by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and merchants in various parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, were no longer recognized as representations of the crucified Saviour, but came to be looked upon as pictures of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p>The name Wilgefortis is usually derived from <em>Virgo fortis</em>, but recently Schn&uuml;rer has shown that Wilgefortis is probably a corruption of <em>Hilge Vartz</em> (<em>Vartz, Fratz</em>, face), "Holy Face". This would corroborate the opinion that the legend originated in the "Volto Santo". The old English name <em>Uncumber</em>, as also the German <em>Oncommer</em> and their equivalents in other languages, rose from the popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that every one who invokes the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in the hour of death will die <em>ohne Kummer</em>, without anxiety. When the cult of St. Wilgefortis began to spread in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, her name found its way into various breviaries and <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>. Thus a breviary, printed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Diocese of Salisbury</a> in 1533, has a beautiful metric antiphon and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 20 July. She is usually represented nailed to a cross: as a girl of ten or twelve years, frequently with a <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, or as throwing her golden boot to a musician playing before her, sometimes also with one foot bare.
