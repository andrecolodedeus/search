<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria</h1>  

<p>Son of Duke Albrecht V. Born at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 29 September, 1548; died at Schlessheim, 7 February, 1626. He studied in 1563 at the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>, but left on account of an outbreak of the pest. Nevertheless, he continued his studies elsewhere until 1568, and retained throughout life a keen interest in learning and art. In 1579 he became the reigning duke. He made a reputation by his strong religious opinions and devotion to the Faith, and was called "the Pious". His life was under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. He attended Mass every day, when possible several times a day, devoted four hours daily to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, one to contemplation, and all his spare time to devotional reading. He received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> weekly, and twice a week in the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> season and during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. Whenever possible he took part in public devotions, processions, and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>; thus in 1585 he went on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Loreto and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His court was jestingly called a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and his capital the German <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He founded several <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, in particular that of St. Michael at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and contributed to the missions in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. He did everything possible in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> to further the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>, and laboured to prevent the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Thus it was largely through his efforts that the Archbishopric of Cologne did not become <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, due mainly to the vigorous support he gave his brother Ernst, who had been elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> against Gebhard Truchsess. On the other hand, the manner in which he bestowed <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> upon members of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> makes an unpleasant impression at the present day, though, at that time, this was not considered so unseemly. In the end his brother Ernest had, besides other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and Wilhelm's son Ferdinand was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of an equal number; another son intended for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> life, Philip, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1595 and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1596, but died in 1598. Wilhelm had his eldest son Maximilian <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> with much care, and in 1597 he resigned the government to Maximilian and led a retired life, devoted to works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, asceticism, and charity, and also to the placid enjoyment of his collections of works of art and curiosities.
