<h1>Will and Testament of Clerics</h1>  

<p>Roman law allowed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to dispose of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by will or otherwise. Bishops, however, were incapable of bequeathing goods acquired in the episcopate, these going to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> purposes in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the deceased. Goods possessed by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> before entering the episcopate, as well as the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> dying intestate, passed on to their lawful heirs, or, when these were wanting, to the churches to which the decedents were attached (Cod. Just., lib. I, titt. iii, xli, sections 5,6; Novel., cxxiii, 19; cxxxi 13). Clerics succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of intestates in the same manner as <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> [Cod., lib. I, titt. iii, liv (lxvi), sect. 6], and their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> earnings were not brought into computation (Cod., lib. I, tit. xxxiii). The same law applied to regulars also (Cod., lib. I, tit. liv, sect. 7), but this was afterwards altered, the community succeeding to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of regulars (Novel., v, 5; xciii, 38). While it is not easy in the mass of legislation of the first eight centuries to determine just what is of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> origin, we may conclude that ancient canons forbade the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to bequeath <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> that they had acquired through the church. Early ecclesiastical law gave to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the right of ownership and the disposition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by will, while it was not licit for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of lower grades to own anything, all goods being possessed in common. Property, too, of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> acquired in the episcopate with funds accruing from the church reverted at death to the diocese [cf. Canon, Apostolorum, nn. 39 (40), 75; Gratian., P. II, Cau. XII, q. 1]. Inventories of private an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods possessed by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were prescribed, and the later were not to be bequeathed with the former (Counc. Antioch, A.D. 341, xxiv-v; Counc. Epaon, A.D. 517, xvii).

<p>Private ownership by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> acquired though <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or other sources not <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> was later acknowledged (III Counc. Carthage, A.D. 397; Gratian., l.x., q. 3). Bishops and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of lower degree were forbidden to leave legacies to those outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even though relatives (Counc. Carthage, xiii), while <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> if they named <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> heirs, or, if dying intestate, their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> devolved on such (Codex Eccl. Afric., lxxxi). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when not constituted heir by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was indemnified under certain conditions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (<a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a>, A.D. 506, xxxiii) and in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (I Coun. Seville, A.D. 590, i). According to the Councils of <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a> (vi) and <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Rheims</a> (A.D. 625, xx) <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> bequeathed to a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> was considered as given to his church. Canons, particularly of the sixth century, directing <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to make the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> their heir, affected likewise succession by intestacy (<a href="../cathen/10545a.htm#agde">Agde</a>, xxxiii). This restriction applied to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only: attempts were frequently made to exclude also heirs of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Legislation was enacted against this abuse (Coun. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, A.D. 615, vii). The contrary practice by which heirs of intestate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appropriated <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> had to be guarded against, especially in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> [Counc. <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, A.D. 516, xii; Counc. L&eacute;rida, A.D. 546 (?), cap. ult.]. While in <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> heirs of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> succeeded in case of intestacy, care was exercised by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that this should be in regard to private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> only (Counc. Antioch, l.c.; Chalcedon, A.D. 451, xxii).

<p>When <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> were established their income was intended to furnish incumbents proper support: the residue, if any, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were encouraged to give in charity while living, and they were forbidden to bequeath it even to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> institutions. The <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Third Lateran Council</a> in 1179 enacted (Decr. III, 26, vii) that this residue (see <a href="../cathen/08571a.htm">JUS SPOLII</a>) be returned to the church or churches (proportionately) whence it came. The purpose of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> was to prevent among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the insidious vice of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, to restrain those who would amass wealth for the enriching of relatives, and likewise to enforce the ancient canons, viz. that such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> be employed for religious or charitable ends. <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, then reigning, did not disapprove, however of (Decr. 1. c., cap. 12) the custom of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> bequeathing this surplus for charitable works, with a moderate sum to servants in appreciation for services rendered, though this was not in accordance with the canons. It was decreed towards the end of the fourteenth century (<a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, Vet. et Nov. Eccl. Disciplina, P. III, 1. 3, lvii, De Spolis Cleric.) that these goods or spoils be reserved to the Camera Apostolica or Papal Treasury to be applied to the needs of the universal Church. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> (Romani Pontifices, a. 1542) insisted on the force of this enactment and admonished those concerned to collect the spoils. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (Decens esse, a. 1560) decreed that all the possessions of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of which they could not lawfully dispose be reserved at death to the Papal Treasury: this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (<a href="../cathen/01646a.htm">Apostolicae servitutis</a>, a. 1741). Various decrees determine in detail what is embraced in the spoils of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> transferred these spoils to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a> for the support of the missions. There are, however, many exemptions from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of spoils, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was always ready, were it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to renounce her title to these goods in favour of the deceased <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> own church. Special legislation was enacted at times and agreements entered into with civil governments in regard to the estates of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Gradually in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it became customary, and a special privilege was often granted by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to this effect, for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to bequeath their possessions, <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> acquiescing to avoid numerous suits and litigations, and because too of the difficulty in individual cases of deciding just what constitutes the residue of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> income in question, since during life the surplus may have been given in charity. Many canonists admit (cf. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De Syn.", L. VII, c. ii) that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> really own or have dominion over this surplus, and hence there is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on the part of legatees of restoring these goods. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has not been abrogated, but merely modified by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, can. i, De ref.), prohibiting the use of these goods for profane purposes. Consequently by reason of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> precept, as well as owing to an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in charity, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are bound not to bequeath to relatives or others for their own use the income of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. Goods accruing to a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> from other sources, e.g. from <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, literary pursuits, the exercise of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, etc., or even the income of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> saved by frugality, may be disposed of without hindrance in life or at death. On account of changed conditions and civil legislation <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are wont to bequeath all their possessions indiscriminately without regard to the mode of acquisition. These bequests are valid in the external forum, though in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> the testators may be responsible for the loss suffered by charitable works. In <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> in most countries the status of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> differs in no way from that of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, and legal heirs enter in when a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> dies intestate.

<p>It is prescribed that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> leave to their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> sacred utensils purchased with funds received from the diocese. Bishops are admonished (III Plen. Counc. Balt., n. 269) to provide by testament or other legal document for due succession in <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, and to determine what disposition after death is to be made of their personal belongings. Priests too (loc. cit., n. 277) are exhorted to make their will in due season, being mindful in their legacies of the needs of religion and charity. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> when created receive in a brief (De benignitate Sedis Apos.) the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make a testament. This brief, notwithstanding a previous prohibition of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, allows <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to bequeath <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, vestments, and the like, to churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> institutions etc., especially to their own churches or titulars. If they do not avail themselves of this right, the articles in question belong to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. This six <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> nullius must bequeath such articles to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, "Quum illud", 1 June, 1847). Regulars, whether superiors or subjects, do not enjoy the faculty of making a will, since owing to a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience they are not their own masters, and secondly because of their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty they are incapable of ownership (Can. vii, Can. 19, q. 3). What they acquire belongs to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. They may explain or interpret a will made before their profession. A member of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who becomes a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> acquires <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, not for his community; but even his is incapable of making a will without the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, since episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> does not release him from his religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Goods possessed by regulars, who with permission live outside their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, belong to the community; the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of those who dwell in the world without permission and of those who are perpetually secularized follow the general law of spoils (Greg. XIII, Officii nostri, a. 1577). Members of orders which have been suppressed by <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> may under certain conditions, owing to a special privilege, dispose by will of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> acquired. Those who make simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> only are not deprived of the power to make a will.
