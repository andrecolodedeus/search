<h1>Willem Hessels van Est</h1>  

<p>(ESTIUS.)

<p>A famous commentator on the Pauline epistles, born at Gorcum, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, in 1542; died at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, 20 September, 1613. Gorcum at that time contained about 5000 inhabitants, among who the most illustrious belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Est, both on his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> and mother's side. Est was born at a time of great excitement, and though the mildest of men his whole life was spent amidst scenes of controversy and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was still in full vigour, though he had only four years to live. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> was active at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was flooded with books and pamphlets <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacking the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Very few writers did more to show (and that in quite and unostentatious manner) the hollowness of the reformer's Biblical arguments than Est. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at home, after which he went to <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, where he studied classics and thence proceeded to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, where he spent about twenty years in the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. During the last ten years there he was professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in one of the colleges. In 1580 he received the degree of Doctor of Theology. He was throughout distinguished by sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, great ability, and application to study. During this time he was frequently the bearer of pecuniary aid to his uncle, Nicolas Pieck, O.S.F., who was giving missions in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; but the latter would never accept any help. In 1572, while Est was still at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, a great catastrophe befell his native town, which was captured by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>. His father, brother, and uncle were made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> and were in eminent danger of their lives. The father and brother escaped, but Nicolas Pieck, who was then Superior of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Gorcum, and eighteen other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, were taken to Brielle, on the sea-coast, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, with revolting brutality. Est wrote what is considered the best history of the Martyrs of Gorcum, who were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1867. From this history we learn many details about Est and his relatives.

<p>When Est first arrived at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> he found the place in a ferment owing to the recently broached opinions of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, one of the professors of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, and who held a leading position in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> all the time that Est was there. Violent controversy raged round the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> during all that time. It is evident from the commentaries of Est that he was much influenced on questions of grace and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> by the teaching of his old professor, <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>; and on these points he has to be read with some caution. After having been made doctor, he continued teaching <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> two years longer. In 1582 he was made professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, a position which he retained for thirty-one years. He was also for many years <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and during the last eighteen years of his life chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">University of Douai</a>. He was noted for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, modesty, and compassion for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and greatly admired for his vast learning, solid judgement, and eloquence. He was afterwards styled <em>doctor fundatissimus</em> by the learned <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a>. Soon after he left <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> a fresh controversy broke out there, into which he appears to have been drawn. About 1586 <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a> began to refute the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> in his ordinary course of lectures. The friends of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, who admired him for his edifying life, great learning, and manly submission, felt annoyed that his shortcomings should have been thus pointedly accentuated by their opponents. They attacked certain propositions of <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a>, resembling those of Molina and Francisco Su&aacute;rez, and had them condemned by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> as savouring of Semipelagianism. The sister <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> added its condemnation (said to have been obtained under a misapprehension), and its terms were in still more violent language. It has been said, though on no very clear evidence, that the form of condemnation was drawn up by Est. There can be little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that but he was in favour of the condemnation. The whole controversy finally led up to the <a href="../cathen/04238a.htm">Congregatio de Auxilis</a>. On maturer examination the teaching of <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a> on grace etc; was found to be innocuous.

<p>Most of Est's works, which were written in Latin, were not published until after his death. His greatest work is his "In omnes Divi Pauli et Catholicas Epistolas Commentarii" (Douai, 1614-15; Mainz, 1858-60). There are several later editions, that of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (1841-45, 7 vols.) Being one of the best. To this work was prefixed the author's protestation of loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which he declares that he desires to submit all things to the judgement of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its supreme <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and judge on earth, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, and if anything has been spoken in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that it be considered as unsaid. In his commentaries he everywhere endeavours to arrive at the literal meaning of the author, with great judgement, acumen, and erudition. He refutes objections, as occasion arises, with calmness and freedom from passion. No serious student of the Epistles can afford to neglect this work. Horne, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writer (Introd., London, 1834, II, 293), says that it is "a most valuable work, which Womanists and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> alike concur to recommend as an excellent critical help to the exposition of the Apostolic Epistles. The prefaces of Est are particularly valuable." His other works are: "Commentarii in IV libros Senttentiarum Petri Lombardi" (Douai, 1615); "Annotationes in praecipua et difficiliora S. Scripturae loca" (Douai, 1617); "Historia Martyrum Gorcomiensium" (Douai, 1603; also in the "Acta SS." for July, II, 754-847). He also translated the life of <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">St. Edmund Campion, S.J.</a>, from French into Latin, and left copious notes for a new edition of the works of St. Agustine.
