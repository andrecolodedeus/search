<h1>William Bishop</h1>  

<p>The first superior in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in episcopal orders since the old <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> died out in the reign of Elizabeth, born c. 1553 at Brailes in Warwickshire, where his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> continued to reside until recent times; d. 16 April, 1624. He went to Gloucester Hall, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in 1570; but retired abroad four years later, and joined Allen at the English College, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. From thence he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and after completing his studies and being <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, we find him once more in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he was called upon to endure many and great hardships. On at least two occasions, he was apprehended, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for some years, and then banished. It was during one of these periods of banishment that he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and took the degree of Doctor of Divinity at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. Dr. Bishop took a leading part in the unfortunate disputes between seculars and regulars at that time. The latter party, by means of their influence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had secured the appointment of an "archpriest" as superior of the English mission. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> resented this, calling out for the restoration of episcopal government in some form. They became known as "the Appellants", and were favoured by Elizabeth, who contrived to assist them secretly to prosecute their appeals. In 1598 Bishop himself went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to lay their case before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On their arrival, however, they found the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> influence still supreme, and by order of <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a>, Protector of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, they were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at the English College under <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a>. After three months' confinement, they were dismissed, but with a strict injunction not to go back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It was not until there had been further representations and another deputation to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that four years later this injunction was removed.

<p>Soon after his return, in 1603, Bishop drew up the famous "Protestation of Allegiance" to Queen Elizabeth, signed by twelve other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> besides himself, in which they definitely took up their stand against those who aimed at the conversion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by political means. At least one of these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (<a href="../cathen/13116a.htm">Roger Cadwallador</a>) was afterwards <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> and probably also a second (<a href="../cathen/05165a.htm">Robert Drury</a>), though there is some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about his identity. Elizabeth never saw the "Protestation", for on the very day on which it was signed, she was seized with what proved to be her last illness. It was <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> denounced by the opposing party; but it would seem that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was large-minded enough not to condemn it, for when more than twenty years later the petition of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was at length granted, and a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was appointed with episcopal powers, William Bishop was chosen for the office. He became nominally <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a></em>. Dr. Bishop was only to be Vicar Apostolic for ten months; but during that short time he organized a systematic form of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government, consisting of five vicars-general, assisted by <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> and rural deans throughout the country. He also instituted a chapter of twenty-four canons, who were to assume <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> whenever there should be for any reason no <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, which happened at one time for thirty years. His right to make such institution has often been questioned, but during the period referred to, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> recognized their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. On the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1850, when <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chapters were erected, the "Old Chapter" did not dissolve, but changed its name, and as the "Old Brotherhood of the Secular Clergy" it exists today, a lasting memorial to the work of the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. An oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of Bishop hangs at Archbishop's House, <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, London, a print of which appeared in the "Catholic Directory" for 1810. The works of Bishop are: "A Reformation of a Catholicke Deformed, in answer to W. Perkins" (1604; Part II, 1607); "Answer to Mr. Perkins's Advertisement" (1607); "Reproof of Dr. Abbot's Defence of a Catholicks Deformed" (1608); "Disproof of Dr. Abbot's Counterproofs" (1614); "Defence of King's Title"; "Pitts, de Illustribus Angli&aelig; Scriptoribus" (1619); "Protestation of Loyalty" (see above); pamphlets on <a href="../cathen/16004a.htm">archpriest controversy</a>, etc.
