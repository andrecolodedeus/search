<h1>William Byrd</h1>  

<p>English composer, born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1542 or 1543; died 4 July, 1623. He was the son of a musician, and studied music principally under <a href="../cathen/14435a.htm">Thomas Tallis</a>. He became <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> at <a href="../cathen/09266b.htm">Lincoln</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> in 1563, chorister in the Chapel Royal in 1570, and in 1575 received the title of Organist of the Chapel Royal without being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to perform the functions of that office. Byrd was the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/04436a.htm">contrapuntist</a> and the most prolific composer of his time in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. F&eacute;tis calls him the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a>. He was the first Englishman to write madrigals, a form which originated in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the thirteenth century, and received its highest development in the sixteenth century at the hands of <a href="../cathen/01687b.htm">Arcadelt</a> and other masters. An <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> and performer of the first order upon the virginals, Byrd wrote for the latter instrument an enormous number of compositions, many of which are played today. His chief significance lies, however, in his compositions for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which he produced a great many. In 1607 he published a collection of <em>gradualia</em> for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year, among which is to be found a three-part setting of the words of the multitude in the Passion according to St. John. A modern edition of this setting was published in 1899. In 1611 "Psalms, Songs and Sonnets, Some Solemn, Others Joyful, Framed to the Life of the Words, Fit for Voyces or Viols, etc." appeared. Probably in the same year was issued "Parthenia", a collection of virginal music, in which Byrd collaborated with J. <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and Orlando Gibbons. Three masses &#151; for three, four, and five voices, respectively &#151; belong to the composer's best period. The one for five voices was reprinted by the Musical Antiquarian Society in 1841, and in 1899 the same work was issued by Breitkopf and Hartel. Two of his <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motets</a>, "Domine, ne irascaris" and "Civitas sancti tui", with English texts, are in the repertoire of most <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>. In spite of the harrowing religious <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> under which he lived, in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James I, Byrd remained faithful to his principles and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, as is shown in his life and by his works. In his last will and testament he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> "that he may live and dye a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect member of the Holy Catholike Churche withoute which I beleeve there is noe salvacon for me".
