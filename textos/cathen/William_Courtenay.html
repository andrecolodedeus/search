<h1>William Courtenay</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, born in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Martin's, <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, c. 1342; died at Maidstone, 31 July, 1396; was the son of Hugh Courtenay, Earl of Devon, and Margaret, daughter of Humphrey Bohun, Earl of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>. He studied at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he took the degree of D.C.L. In 1367 he was elected chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. On this occasion the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> successfully resisted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln's claim to the right of confirming its choice, and later Courtenay obtained from <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> declaring a chancellor's election valid without the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. After holding <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> in the churches of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, Wells, and York, he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 17 March, 1370. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> his support was given to the Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and Bishop Wykeham against the anti-clerical movement led by John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and later his efforts to suppress the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a> were unceasing. In the Convocation of 1373 he strongly opposed the granting of a subsidy to the king until the latter should try to remedy the evils then afflicting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Courtenay was transferred to the See of London, 12 Sept., 1375. In 1377 <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Pope Gregory XI</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the Florentines, and Courtenay published it at Paul's Cross. The result was that the Florentines in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> were attacked by the populace; the magistrates had to interfere, and the king extended his protection to the foreigners. Courtenay was accused of violating the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by publishing the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. When called upon to retract what he had published, his answer was made through an official, who declared from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> words had been misunderstood, and there the matter ended. When the Convocation was summoned in 1377, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, in the interests of John of Gaunt, omitted to summon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>. Courtenay protested against this and succeeded in getting Wykeham's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> recognized. Then followed his attempts to repress the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> was cited to appear before the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at St. Paul's. <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> came accompanied by John of Gaunt, who insisted upon a seat being provided for the accused; an altercation ensued which resulted in the court breaking up in confusion. Courtenay's authority alone restrained the citizens from using <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> towards Lancaster. Again, in obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 18 Dec., he summoned <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, but nothing came of the summons, and the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a> continued to increase in numbers and influence. Some think that about this time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> offered to create Courtenay a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; whether this was so or not, he was never raised to that dignity, but on 30 July, 1381, he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. Then followed his appointment to the chancellorship of the kingdom 10 Aug., 1382, an office which he shortly afterwards resigned (18 Nov., 1382).

<p>Urged by Parliament he again turned his attention to the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a>, calling a council which condemned their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions. Rigge, the Chancellor of Oxford and a leading Lollard, retracted and sued for pardon on his knees, but on his return to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> continued as before. The Oxford <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a> were finally brought to submission on 18 Nov., when the recantation of their leaders was received at <a href="../cathen/06303b.htm">St. Frideswide's</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> then obtained a statute commanding sheriffs and other officers of the king to imprison <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> when certified as such by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Though this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was repealed the next year, he still had the royal sanction allowing <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to detain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in their own <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>. After the subjugation of Oxford he turned to Leicester (1389), placed the town under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, and in the end received the recantation of the leaders. About 1382 he began a general visitation of his province and met with much opposition; his interference was appealed against by the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> and Salisbury, though both finally submitted. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> also organized a strong opposition to his proposed visitation of Gloucester College, Oxford (1389); on his arrival he was treated with due respect, but they so firmly refused to acknowledge his right that he abandoned his design. Though a strong defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he was always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and loyal to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He so fearlessly condemned the extravagance of the king that he once (1385) had to take refuge in Devonshire to escape the royal <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. When the relations between king and Parliament became so strained as almost to lead to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, it was Courtenay who acted as mediator and averted the danger. He was first buried at Maidstone, where he had founded the College of St. Mary and All Saints; afterwards his body was removed to <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and buried, in the king's presence, at the feet of the Black Prince, near the shrine of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas</a>.
