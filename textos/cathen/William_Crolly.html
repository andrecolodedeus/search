<h1>William Crolly</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, b. at Ballykilbeg, near Downpatrick, 8 June, 1780; d. 6 April, 1849. At fourteen he was sent to a classical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Downpatrick, conducted by Rev. Mr. Nelson, a <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> minister, as there were no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the north of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In November, 1801, he went to Maynooth, and obtained first place in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> in 1806. At Pentecost of the same year he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Dr. Troy, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and for six years lectured in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, and ethics. In 1812 he took charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Belfast, which comprised not only the entire town but also a district more than thirty miles in extent. On being appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a> in 1825, he induced the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to change the episcopal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> from Downpatrick to Belfast, the real centre of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. During the ten years he spent as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this see he built a large church in almost every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and founded <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy's</a> Seminary. Owing to the dearth of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, Dr. Crolly was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to allow <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children to attend <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a course of action which caused a fierce controversy after his death. In 1835 he was appointed to the archdiocese of Armagh. Up to his time no <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> had been allowed to reside in that town, but he lived alternately there and in Drogheda, where most of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> had dwelt in penal times. His first care was to found St. Patrick's Seminary in <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, which was opened in 1838. His great work however, was the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was not completed till twenty-four years after his death. Having with great difficulty acquired a site on an historic hill by the side of the town, he laid the foundation stone on St. Patrick's Day, 1840, amid a vast assemblage of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The work of construction went steadily on until the famine years, and the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> visited several cities in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, making an appeal in person. The famine, however, stopped the progress of the work. When the question of the Queen's colleges arose, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> was one of those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who looked favourably on the project. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that if he had lived till the Synod of Thurles, in which these colleges were formally condemned as pernicious to the Faith, he would have laid aside his own private opinions on this subject, and submitted to the decision of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He died in Drogheda of the cholera, on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> (6 April), 1849, and was buried on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> in the centre of the choir of the still unfinished <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Armagh. A collection of the "Select Sermons" of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> was published shortly after his death.
