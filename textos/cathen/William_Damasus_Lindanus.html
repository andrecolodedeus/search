<h1>William Damasus Lindanus</h1>  

<p>(VAN LINDA)

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ruremonde and of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, b. at Dordrecht, in 1525; d. at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 2 November, 1588; he was the son of Damasus van der Lint. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and having during this time applied himself also to Greek and Hebrew, went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to perfect himself in these languages. In 1552 he won the licentiate at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and the same year was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Two years later, he was appointed professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">University of Dillingen</a>. In 1556, he took the doctor's degree at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> and dean of the chapter at <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a>. Soon afterwards he became a royal counsellor and inquisitor in Friesland. In 1562, Philip II designated Lindanus for the newly erected See of Ruremonde, and the following year, on 4 April, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> by <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Granvelle</a>. He was not, however, able to enter his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> until 11 May, 1569. Throughout the Low Countries the erection of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> had caused displeasure, especially in the country of Guelders, of which Ruremonde was a part: where every act of the royal authority excited defiance. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, moreover, were dissatisfied with the appointment of Lindanus, who was a staunch defender of the Faith. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> began at once to reform his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, assisted in person at the Provincial Synods of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1570, 1573) and carried out the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and regulations of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.

<p>In 1572, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee for several months from Ruremonde to the South of the Low Countries; on his return to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he defended vigorously the properties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. In 1573, a violent conflict broke out between himself and the Duke of Alba; and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to flee on several occasions. In 1578, he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in order to obtain <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> against the chapter of Maestricht, which had refused to execute the regulations concerning the episcopal endowment, as well as to confer with the Holy Father and the king upon the measures <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the safeguarding of the Faith in the Low Countries. Returning to Ruremonde, with the help of Philip II, he founded the royal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> or college at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Lindanus went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> again in 1584 to treat of the interests of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and of the state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Low Countries and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and he insisted particularly upon the urgent necessity of replying in a scientific way to the <a href="../cathen/03534b.htm">Centuriators of Magdeburg</a>. His work in Ruremonde was now brought to a close by his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">See of Ghent</a>, where he began his new episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on 22 July, 1588, and where three months later, he passed away. Among his numerous works the following are especially worthy of mention: "De optimo scripturas interpretandi genere" (Cologne, 1558); "Panoplia evangelica" (Cologne, 1560); "Stromatum libri III pro defensione Concilii Tridentini" (Cologne, 1575); "Missa apostolica" (Antwerp, 1589), and in a more popular form, the dialogues, "Dubitantius" and "Ruwardius" (Cologne, 1562-3). He edited also the academic discourses of Ruard Tapperus (1577-78), and he wrote many works in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> for the instruction of his flock, in order to keep them from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and to refute the Confession of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> of 1566.
