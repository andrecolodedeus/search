<h1>William Errington</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a>, founder of Sedgley Park School, b. 17 July, 1716; d. 28 September, 1768. He was son of Mark Errington of Wiltshire, a descendant of the Erringtons of Walwick Grange, Northumberland; his mother's maiden name was Martha Baker. In 1737 he went to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, took the mission <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> 28 December, 1741, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in December, 1747. If he acted as professor at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, as is generally stated, it could only have been for a very short time, as he left there for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 26 March, 1748 (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> list of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the Westminster archives). On arrival in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> he took up his residence with Bishop Challoner, then coadjutor to Bishop Petre. Kirk states that Dr. Challoner "had a high opinion of Mr. Errington, both as an active and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary and as a man of business". It was on account of these qualities that when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wished to found a good middle-class <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he induced Errington to undertake the work. It was a most difficult undertaking, and Errington made three unsuccessful attempts, the first in Buckinghamshire, the second in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and the third at Betley near Newcastle-under-Lyne in Staffordshire, before he succeeded in founding a permanent <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Sedgley Park in the neighbourhood of Wolverhampton. On Lady-Day, 1763, he opened this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with twelve boys in the house known as the Park Hall, till then the residence of John, Lord Ward, afterwards Viscount Dudley and Ward. The little foundation was at once attacked in Parliament, but Lord Dudley successfully defended himself. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was not interfered with; it developed into the famous Sedgley Park School which did good service to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for over a century, and is now represented by St. Wilfrid's College, Oakmoor, near Cheadle. Having founded the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Errington's work there was done, and as soon as he secured the appointment of the Rev. Hugh Kendall as head-master in May, 1763, he returned to Bishop Challoner in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and treasurer of the "Old Chapter" and held these offices till his death.
