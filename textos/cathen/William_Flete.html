<h1>William Flete</h1>  

<p>An Augustinian <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> friar, a contemporary and great friend of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>; the exact place and date of his birth are unknown and those of his death are disputed. He was an English mystic, and lived in the latter half of the fourteenth century; <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, he afterwards joined the Austin Friars in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but desiring a stricter than they were living, and hearing that there were two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of his order which had returned to primitive discipline near <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, he set out for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. On reaching the forest of Lecceto near <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, in which one of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> stood, he found the place, which abounded in caves, suited to the contemplative life, that with the consent of his superiors he joined this community. Henceforth he spent his days in study and contemplation in one of these caves, and returned to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at night to sleep. He was called the "Bachelor of the Wood"; here he became acquainted with St. Catherine, who occasionally visited him at Lecceto and went to confession to him. He had so great a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for solitude, that he declined to leave it when invited by <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Pope Urban VI</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to assist him with his counsel at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> then disturbing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>He wrote a long panegyric on St. Catherine at her death, which, with another of his works, is preserved in the public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. For at least nineteen years he led a most holy and austere life in this wood, and is said by Torellus to have returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, immediately after St. Catherine's death in 1383, and, after introducing the reform of Lecceto, to have died the same year. Others say he died in 1383, but there is no mention of his death in the book of the dead at Lecceto, and the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of it is uncertain. He was considered a saint by his contemporaries.

<p>None of his works have been printed: they consist of six <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; (1) an epistle to the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his order; (2) a letter to the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the province; (3) an epistle to the brethren in general; (4) predictions to the English of calamities coming upon <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (in this he prophesied that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> would lose the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>); (5) divers epistles; (6) a treatise on remedies against <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. A fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of this last is now in the University Library at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, to which it was presented by George I.
