<h1>William George McCloskey</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, N.Y., 10 Nov., 1823; d. 17 September, 1909. He was the youngest of five brothers. Two of his older brothers also became priests: John, for years president of Mount St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg, Md.; and George, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Nativity, New York. William George was sent to Mount St. Mary's in 1835. In May, 1850, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at that <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> by <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and 6 Oct., 1852, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Hughes in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. He said his first Mass in the basement of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Nativity, of which his brother George was then <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, and remained there ten months as assistant. Then, from a desire to live in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, he returned with the consent of his superiors to Mount St. Mary's, where he taught <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, Scripture, and Latin for about six years. He was appointed, 1 Dec., 1859, the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the American College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, being the unanimous choice of the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> March, 1860. <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown University</a> had shortly before conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Divinity. He was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> until his promotion to the <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">See of Louisville</a> in May, 1868, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the college on 24 May of that year by <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Cardinal de Reisach</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, assisted by Monsignor Xavier de M&eacute;rode, minister of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, and by Monsignor Viteleschi, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a> and Cingoli. Dr. McCloskey's administration of the American College saw the crisis in the history of its affairs, an echo of the crisis in American political life. He was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> during our Civil War. In spite of all his efforts and diplomatic skill the spirit of faction affected the college, Southern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> being as loyal to the South as the Northerners were to the North. Moreover, some of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could at the time send neither students nor support, and the very existence of the institution was threatened. But Dr. McCloskey stood loyally to his post, and cheerfully bore adversity.

<p>He arrived in Louisville as its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> towards the end of summer, 1868. The following facts attest the energy of his character and the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of his administration. He found sixty-four churches and left in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at his death one hundred and sixty-five. He was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to provide <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> for the small settlements of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. From eighty, the number of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> grew to be two hundred. He introduced many <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, the Fathers of the Resurrection, the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, and the Brothers of Mary. The growth of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was chiefly the product of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. The number of children attending them increased from 2000, in 1868, to 12,000, in 1909. In 1869 he established the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> known as Preston Park Seminary. He was present at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870. He also attended the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1866, and the Third, in 1884, strongly advocating in the former the cause of the American College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He had a splendid physique and was a man of talent and cultured taste. He had a strong will, and held tenaciously to any view or plan of action that he had once entered on. Of strong <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of exemplary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life, he was especially charitable to the very poor and to the unfortunate classes of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. He will never be forgotten by the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">magdalens</a> of the House of the Good Shepherd at <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>. Every Sunday, unless stormy weather prevented, he visited, instructed and consoled them, listening to each one's tale of woe and showing to this class that charity of which Christ set the Divine example. He wrote a life of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a> (Louisville, 1900). His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, whom he visited in their homes even in his old age, and to whom he gave whatever money he owned, so that he died a poor man, illuminated the city in which he wielded the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> with force and mercy for almost half a century. He was beloved by all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him.
