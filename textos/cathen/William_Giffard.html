<h1>William Giffard</h1>  

<p>Second Norman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> from 1100 to 1129. Little is known of his history anterior to his episcopate, except that he was successively canon and dean of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and ably filled the office of chancellor to <a href="../cathen/15642c.htm">William the Conqueror</a> (d. 1087), William Rufus (d. 1100), and Henry I. Since the death of Bishop Walkelin in 1098, no appointment had been made to the See of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> during the remaining two years of the reign of Rufus, and the revenues were appropriated by the king. The very first act of Henry I (Stubbs, "Const. Bist.", Oxford, 1891-5, I, 329), after his election as king at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, in Aug., 1100 was to give a token of his goodwill to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by filling the See of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, and he caused William Giffard, who was still only a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, to be duly elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Henry may have wished to provide himself with a strong supporter in the episcopal body, but, from the first, William would appear to have realized that the points at issue between the king and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had become part of the great <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> quarrel of investitures, and declined to accept the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a> from the king's hands. At the moment, the support of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to assure Henry's position; he was too prudent to force the acceptance of the sacred symbol, and Giffard was immediately invested with the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. It only remained to arrange for his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> had returned from exile, and, strengthened by the decision of the council held at the Vatican in 1099, declined to become the <em>homo </em>of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.

<p>An uneasy time followed, and embassies were sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As bishop-elect, Giffard assisted at the council held at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, 20 Sept., 1102. In spite of his agreement with Anselm, Henry invested the Bishops-Elect of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> and <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, and requested Anselm to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> them. Anselm was willing to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Giffard, but in spite of the king's repeated insistence declined to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the others. <a href="../cathen/06466b.htm">Gerard of York</a> having undertaken to do so, one of the bishops-elect returned his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the remaining two had already begun when Giffard, conscience-stricken, declined to take further part in it. The king failed to intimidate him and he was sent into exile, arid his goods confiscated. He had a constant friend and adviser in <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, and when the latter set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in April, 1103, Giffard went with him. Anselm's long stay at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> began about <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1103. In the meantime Giffard had been allowed to come back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, for in 1105 he signed, together with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the petition begging Anselm to return. Eventually a compromise was effected, Anselm returned 1 Aug., 1107; the realities of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> homage were retained, but the special form of the gift of ring and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> was given up by the king. Giffard, who had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> quietly the day before, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Anselm on 11 Aug., 1107.

<p>He regained Henry's confidence and acted for him in several matters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interest. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> one of his first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> was to act as chief commissioner in the completion of the Domesday Record of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, that royal city having been omitted from the Domesday of the Conqueror. In 1110 he negotiated with the king and the community the removal of the so-called "New Minster" (or St. Grimbald's Abbey) founded by <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">King Alfred</a>, which stood in very inconvenient proximity to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on the north side, to a new site outside the city, under the name of Hyde Abbey.

<p>Eventually this led to serious difficulties with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> community, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> having alienated certain revenues which they conceived to belong to them. The difficulty culminated in 1122 in a strange symbolical pageant by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and the interference of the king. Peace was made, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> grew more and more attached to the community, spending most of his time among them, taking his meals with them, wearing the cowl, and eventually dying in their infirmary. The <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> were welcomed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by him and a home was found for them at St. Mary Overy's (now St. Saviour's) in Southwark; near their stately church he built the town-house of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>. To him also belongs the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of having given a first home in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>, by establishing, in Nov., 1128, the abbey of Waverley, near Farnham in Surrey, a filiation of L'Aum&ocirc;ne in the <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Diocese of Chartres</a>. He died on 25 Jan., 1129, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> near his predecessor Walkelin.
