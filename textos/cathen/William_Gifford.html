<h1>William Gifford</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>; b. in Hampshire, 1554; d. at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 11 April, 1629. He was the son of John Gifford, Esquire, of Weston-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir George Throckmorton, Knight, of Coughton, Warwickshire (Wood, "Athen. Oxon.", below). He was sent to Oxford in 1569, where he was entrusted to the care of <a href="../cathen/02783a.htm">John Bridgewater</a>, President of Lincoln College, who was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> at heart. Gifford remained at Oxford for about four years, part of which time he spent in the celebrated boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> kept by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> physician Etheridge, whither he had been removed on the compulsory retirement of <a href="../cathen/02783a.htm">Bridgewater</a> for refusal to conform. After this period, Gifford, accompanied by his tutor, proceeded to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1573), resumed there his studies, and took the degree of M.A. (Athen. Oxon.). After having also obtained his baccalaureate in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> on the completion of a four year's course in that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> under <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Gifford was forced to quit <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> owing to the disturbances in the Low Countries. Proceeding thence, he pursued his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, which he visited (1577) at the invitation of Dr. Allen, and at the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, of which he was admitted a member on 15 Sept., 1579 [<a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a>, "Records of the English Province", etc., VI (London, 1880), 139; but compare statement there given as to age with <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth above]. Having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in March, 1582 (<a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a>, "Records", loc. cit.), he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> by Allen as professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the English College ("Douay Diaries", infra: Diarium Primum, 11; Diarium Secundum, 189 &#151; note statement as to age). The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him in December of 1584 at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, after which, returning to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Gifford taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at intervals for nearly twelve years.

<p>On Allen's elevation to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, Gifford accompanied him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the capacity of <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, and it is said that during this visit he resided for a time in the household of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. About this time (1597) Gifford was preferred to the deanery of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, which office <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> conferred on him at the instance, it is alleged, of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. This dignity he retained for about ten years, and, after his withdrawal from <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> (c. 1606), he was made "rector magnificus" of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> University. In 1608, Gifford, who had always held the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> in high esteem and befriended them in many ways, took the habit of that order and subsequently became <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> at Dieulouard (Dieulewart). In 1811, Father Gabriel of St. Mary, as Gifford was known in religion, went into Brittany and laid the foundation of a small community of his order at St. Malo. He was favourably received by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and a chair of divinity was assigned to him (Petre, op. cit. infra). He was one of the nine definitors chosen in 1617 to arrange the terms of union among the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> congregations in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, of which province he was elected first president in May of the same year. In 1618, Gifford was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> coadjutor to Cardinal Louis de Lorraine, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, with the title of <em>Episcopus Archidali&aelig; </em>(<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Archidal). On the death of <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a>, he succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, becoming also, by virtue of his office, Duke of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and First Peer of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Before his death, which occurred in 1629 he had acquired a high reputation as a preacher. His writings include: "Oratio Funebris in exequiis venerabilis viri domini Max&aelig;miliani Manare pr&aelig;positi ecclesi&aelig; D. Petri oppidi Insulensis" (Douai, 1598); "Orationes divers&aelig;" (Douai); "Calvino-Turcismus", etc. (Antwerp, 1597 and 1603). The latter work, begun by Dr. Reynolds, Gifford completed and edited. He translated from the French of Fronto-Duc&aelig;us, S.J., "The Inventory of Errors, Contradictions, and false Citations of Philip Mornay, Lord of Plessis and Mornay". He also wrote, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Duke of Guise</a>, a treatise in favour of the League. The "Sermones Adventuales" (Reims, 1625) were a Latin rendering by Gifford of discourses originally delivered in French. He assisted <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Dr. Anthony Champney</a> in his "Treatise on the Protestant Ordinations" (Douai, 1616); other of Gifford's <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were destroyed in the burning of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Dieulouard in 1717.
