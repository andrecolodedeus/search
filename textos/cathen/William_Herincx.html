<h1>William Herincx</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born at Helmond, North Brabant, 1621; died 17 Aug., 1678. After receiving his preliminary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at 'S Hertogenbosch he entered the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, where he devoted himself with great ardour to the study of the ancient classics and obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. As a student he was distinguished for his diligence, modesty, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. After completing his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> course, he resolved to embrace the religious state and entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. In 1653 he was appointed lecturer in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. His superiors, who had observed his great talents and success in teaching, ordered him (1658) to draw up a course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for use in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the first volume of his work was published in 1660. The style is concise and clear. A spirit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> pervades the work. In the preface to his "Summa Theologica", he writes: "The teaching of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> does not consist alone in the search after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but it behooves us to make use of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for our own sanctification and for the sanctification of others, and above all for kindling and nourishing in ourselves and in others the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." According to the constitutions of his order, Father Herincx propounds the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, but he does not neglect the teachings of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> or <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>.

<p>Father Herincx was a Probabilist, and his tractate "De conscientia" is a masterpiece. He shows that the system of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> is not altogether new, and he draws his <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, St. Bonaventure, St. Antonine, and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, although the Subtle Doctor is not so explicit on the matter as the other ancient writers. According to Herincx, the tempest that arose in the seventeenth century against <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> had its origin in <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, for Rigorism was unknown among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The decrees of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, issued in 1665 and 1666, after the publication of Herincx's work, called for some modifications in the latter, and Father Van Goorlacken, <em><a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> jubilate</em>, was commissioned to bring out a new edition. After fifteen years spent in teaching <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, Father Herincx was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the title of <em>Lector Jubilate</em>, equivalent to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> degree of Doctor of Divinity. He was twice elected minister provincial, then definitor general, and finally commissary general for the northern countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. On 28 April, 1677, whilst making a <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he received word at Newport that Charles II had nominated him <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Bishop of Ypres</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 24 October in the same year, in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. He left immediately for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> but ruled it for less than a year; he died while making his first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> visitation. The epitaph on his tombstone in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Ypres says: "Ob virtutem et omnimodam eruditionem ad has infulas assumptus". Letters found in his room after his death show that his promotion to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> had been determined on by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. His "Summa Theologica Scholastica et Moralis" was published at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1660-63; 2nd ed., 1680; 3rd, 1702-04.
