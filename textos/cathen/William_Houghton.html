<h1>William Houghton</h1>  

<p>(Variously called DE HOTUM, DE HOTHUM, DE HOZUM, BOTHUM, DE HONDEN, HEDDON, HEDDONEM, according as his name was pronounced by those of different nationalities--in the ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of his order it is invariably written DE ODONE).

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and place of birth unknown; died at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, 1298. His great learning united to solid <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> made him illustrious among the savants of his time, while his rare <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in the management of affairs gave him no small distinction among the statesmen of the thirteenth century. It is not known in which <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he received the habit of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>--it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he made his higher studies in the Convent of St. James in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>--there he took his degrees and lectured with great success. In the general chapter of the order held in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1282 he was chosen Provincial of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and discharged the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of this office with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and ability. His contemporaries all speak of a uniform sweetness and a singular charm and distinction of manner which won for him at once <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and respect. He governed the English province for five years, when he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to resume his public lectures on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. His ability was recognized by the court of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, especially by the king, <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> wished him to return home, and they elected him provincial, which office he filled for a term of seven years. He became a favourite of King Edward I, and received many marks of royal affection and esteem.

<p>Edward I sent Houghton to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as ambassador to propose to the Holy Father his royal desire to assist his Holiness in affording help to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the Holy Land. The king proposed the conditions of the Holy Siege and he did this through his minister, William Houghton, who was favourably received at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and obtained nearly all that he desired. He returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> from <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a>, dated <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 10 Nov., 1289.

<p>The See of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> had become <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> by the death of Archbishop John de Sandford. Thomas Chatworth, the successor named by the chapter, was not acceptable to the king, so the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> from Oct., 1294, to June, 1297. Edward I appealed to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Pope Boniface VIII</a> requesting the appointment of William Houghton. This wish was granted and Houghton was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> by Anthony Beck, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, in 1297.

<p>A bloody <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was raging between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the two monarchs, <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Edward I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, were brought by the prudent mediatorship of Houghton to conclude a treaty of peace for two years. In 1298, Edward I sent Houghton to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to acquaint his Holiness with the conclusion of the treaty of peace. Having been received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> (20 June, 1298) Houghton set out for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> but on the way fell sick at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>) and died there 28 August, 1298. By command of Edward I the remains were brought to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and laid in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>. Notwithstanding the important public offices Houghton filled, he found time to write the following works: &quot;Commentarii in Sententiarum Libros&quot;, &quot;De immediata visione Dei tractatus&quot;, &quot;De unitate formarum Tractatus&quot;, &quot;Lectur&aelig; Scholastic&aelig;&quot;, and a speech in French on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the English king.
