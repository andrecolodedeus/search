<h1>William Maziere Brady</h1>  

<p>Ecclesiastical writer, b. in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 8 January, 1825; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 19 March, 1894. He was nephew of Sir Maziere Brady, Bart., Lord Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and youngest son of Sir Nicholas W. Brady who, whilst Lord Mayor of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, was knighted by George IV during his visit to that city. William Maziere Brady entered Trinity college, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in 1842, received the <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">Degree of B.A.</a> in 1848, B. D. in 1858, and D. D. in 1863. In 1848 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of Maynooth and in 1849, <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of Kilkeedy, Limerick. In 1851 he became <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of St. Dolough's, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and in the same year Rector of Farrahy, County Cork. In this year, also, he married a lineal descendant, on the maternal side, of the famous <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> divine, Jeremy Taylor, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>. Dr. Brady acted as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to several successive viceroys, and in 1681 became Vicar of <a href="../cathen/04064b.htm">Clonfert</a>, County Cork. While here he published in three volumes the "Clerical and Parochial Records of Cork, Cloyne and Ross" (Dublin, 1863), which he compiled from <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> registries and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the principal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> and public offices of Oxford, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and from private and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> papers. These "Records" are mainly those of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Diocese of Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/04072a.htm">Cloyne</a>, and Ross, but will no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be of great service to the future <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historians of these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>Dr. Brady published several works in favour of the disestablishment of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Church, such as: "Remarks on the Irish Church Temporalities" (1865); "Facts or Fiction; The alleged Conversion of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Bishops to the Reformed Religion at the Accession of Queen Elizabeth and the Assumed Descent of the Present Established Hierarchy from the Ancient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church Disproved" (1866), which went through five editions; "State Papers concerning the Irish Church in the time of Queen Elizabeth" (1868); "Some Remarks on the Irish Church Bill" (1869); and "Essays on the English State Church in Ireland" (1869). On the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church question he also contributed numerous letters to the newspaper press, and articles to "Fraser's" and "The Contemporary", many of which were subsequently reprinted in pamphlet or book form. Some interesting articles from his pen appeared in the "Catholic World" on "Ireland's Mission" (May, 1870); "The Ancient Irish Churches" (July, 1870), written while yet a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and "Pius IX and Mr. Gladstone's Misrepresentations" (May, 1875). His only work of a purely secular character is "The McGillicuddy Papers; a Selection from the Family Archives of the McGillicuddy of the Reeks, with an Introductory Memoir" (1867).

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Disestablishment act was passed, Dr. Brady went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he examined the Vatican archives for information touching the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. He shortly resigned his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> as Vicar of Donoughpatrick, and Rector of Kilbery, <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, to which he had been promoted from <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and in May, 1873, was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by Monsignor, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, Kirby, Rector of the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His Vatican researches led to the publication of two volumes on "Episcopal Succession in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, A.D. 1400 to 1875, with Appointments to Monasteries, and Extracts from Manuscripts in Public and Private Libraries in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>" (Rome, 1876-77). He also brought out, "Annals of the Catholic Hierarchy in England and Scotland, A.D. 1585-1876, with a Dissertation on Anglican Orders" (Rome, 1877; London, 1883). During his stay in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Dr. Brady acted for a long time as correspondent of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> "Tablet", and issued a pamphlet on "The Pope's Anti-Parnellite Circular" (London, 1883). The last of his works was the "Anglo-Roman Papers", published in 1890. He had a large share in the political controversies of the day and corresponded much with Gladstone and other eminent statesmen. He died of apoplexy and was buried in the Campo Verrano Cemetery in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His grave is marked with an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Cross on white marble, bearing the inscription, "In memory of William Maziere Brady, Cavalier of the Order of Pius IX, and Private Chamberlain to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">His Holiness Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">His Holiness Leo XIII</a>. Born in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, January 8, 1825, died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, March 19, 1894".
