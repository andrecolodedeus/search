<h1>William Peyto</h1>  

<p>(P<font size=-2>ETO,</font> P<font size=-2>ETOW</font>).

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>; d. 1558 or 1559. Though his parentage was long unknown, it is now established that he was the son of Edward Peyto of Chesterton, Warwickshire, and Goditha, daughter of Sir Thomas Throckmorton of Coughton. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the Grey Friars and took his degree of <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B. A.</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; but he was incorporated in Cambridge <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, 1502-3, and became M. A. there in 1505. He was elected fellow of Queen's College in 1506, and on 14 June, 1510, was incorporated M. A. at Oxford. Entering the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, he became known for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life, and was appointed confessor to Princess Mary. Later on he was elected Provincial of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and held that office when in 1552 he denounced the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in the king's presence. He was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> till the end of that year, when he went abroad and spent many years at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> and elsewhere in the Low Countries, being active on behalf of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. In 1539 he was included in the Act of <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">Attainder</a> passed against <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> and his friends (31 Hen. VIII, c. 5), but he was in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the time and remained there out of the king's reach. On 30 March, 1543, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> nominated him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. He could not obtain possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, nor did he attempt to do so, on the accession of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> in 1553, but resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and retired to his old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Greenwich. There he remained till <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, who had known him in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and highly esteemed him, decided to create him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in place of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>. But as Peyto was very old and his powers were failing, he declined both dignities. He was, however, created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in June, 1557, though <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> would not allow him to receive the hat, and the appointment was received with public derision. It was a tradition among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> that he was pelted with stones by a <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> mob, and so injured that he shortly afterwards died (<a href="../cathen/11504a.htm">Parkinson</a>, op. cit. below, p. 254). Other accounts represent him as dying in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The date frequently assigned for his death (April, 1558) is incorrect, as on 31 October, 1558, <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that she had offered to reinstate him in the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> on the death of Bishop Capon, but that he had declined because of age and infirmity.
