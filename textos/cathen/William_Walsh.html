<h1>William Walsh</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (1554-77); b. at Dunboyne, Co. Meath, about 1512; d. at Alcal&aacute; de Henares, 4 Jan., 1577. He joined the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Bective, Co. Meath, and being sent to study at Oxford took a doctor's degree in divinity either there or elsewhere. The suppression of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> must have driven him from Oxford in 1536, and the confiscation of Bective in 1537 left him homeless. Going abroad, he became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was now probably that by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> he exchanged into the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a>, and was made <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of their suppressed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Dulchek and Colpe. Walsh returned when <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a> came as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, for in 1554 he was in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> commission for depriving married <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Staples, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, being thus deprived, Walsh, already nominated by the Crown, was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, 18 Oct., 1554, subject to seeking <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation within twelve months. He assumed his charge immediately, retaining, as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was impoverished, the rectory of Loughsewdy and his <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>. Henceforward he was busied in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil affairs, and the Government employed him in many commissions until the second year of Queen Elizabeth. But when she introduced a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> liturgy into <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Walsh resisted strenuously in Convocatio, and preached at Trim against the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>. On 4 Feb., 1560, he refused the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a>, was deprived of his temporalities, and by the Queen's order committed to custody. Divested of royal favour and withdrawn from secular affairs, he recalled the condition of his appointment, and when released, some eighteen months later, he submitted his case at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In consistory held 6 Sept., 1564, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate's</a> provision was declared void, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in the circumstances, reappointed Dr. Walsh. About the time when this would have been known in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Walsh was cited before the Ecclesiastical Commission, and on refusing the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a> or to answer interrogatories, was committed to Dublin Castle, 143 July, 1565.

<p>Loftus, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, advised his removal to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> that the learned <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there might win him to conformity; he was, he said, of great credit among his countrymen, who depended wholly on him in religious concerns. Nevertheless he was left in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and lay fettered in a dark and filthy cell in <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1572, when his friends contrived his escape to <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> in Brittany. After six months of destitution he was aided by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to proceed to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He reached Alcal&aacute; almost moribund through privations, fatigues, and festering wounds form his fetters, and was first received in the house of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lady, who herself dressed his sores and nursed him with tender solicitude. Afterwards he removed to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and expired among his former brethren, esteemed a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to the Faith. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the Church of St. Secundinus and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Grenada erected a monument to his memory.
