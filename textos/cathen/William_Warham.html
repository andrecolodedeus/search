<h1>William Warham</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, born at Church Oakley, Hampshire, about 1450; died at Hackington, near <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, 22 August, 1532. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Winchester School and New College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, of which he became a fellow in 1475. Having taken his doctorate of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> he left Oxford in 1488, to become an advocate in the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, but two years later he returned to Oxford as principal of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. His ability <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be employed to several foreign embassies, and his success obtained for him much <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preferment. He became <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> of Wells (1493), <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Barley (1495), <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Huntingdon (1497), and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Cottenham (1500). On 13 February, 1494, he had been appointed to the important legal office of Master of the Rolls. While absent on one of his frequent missions abroad he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (October, 1501), but was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> till 25 September, 1502. In the interval he had resigned the office of Master of the Rolls, and had been appointed to the more important post of Keeper of the Great Seal. So great was his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for learning and ability that fresh honours followed rapidly. On 29 November, 1503, <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> nominated him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and on 21 January, 1504, the king made him Lord Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> at Lambeth on Candlemas Day and was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> on 9 March. He took a leading part in all important national business, and his powers as an orator were in much demand on great occasions of state. His <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of Oxford chose him as Chancellor in 1506.

<p>In 1509 he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> and Katherine of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, and under the new king he enjoyed the same confidence as under Henry VII till he was overshadowed by the growing influence of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>. In 1512 he became involved in a controversy with his suffragans, who considered that he pushed the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> prerogative too far, and the matter was finally settled by a compromise. When <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1515 Warham conferred the hat upon him in <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>, and thereafter he was forced into the second place. Before <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> he resigned the office of Lord Chancellor, as he had long wished to do, being out of sympathy with the king's anti-French policy, and <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> received the Great Seal in his stead. Warham's power was still further diminished in 1517 when <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, and from that time forward there were constant official differences between them, though their private relations continued friendly. <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> continually interfered with the action of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the southern province and not infrequently overruled his decisions. In state affairs, especially in the raising of subsidies, he supported <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, though he incurred the contempt of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> enemies for doing so. When the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> question was first raised in 1527 he was <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> assessor in the secret inquiry into the validity of the king's marriage. About this time his health began to fail, and he was no longer equal to taking an effective part in the important affairs that ensued. Being selected as the chief of the counsel appointed to assist Queen Katherine he did nothing on her behalf, but when she appealed to him for advice, replied that he would not meddle in such matters. He steadfastly refused to oppose the king's wishes, and in the summer of 1530 signed the petition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> begging him to allow the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. This course he pursued under threats from the king that unless he was complaisant all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> would be destroyed.

<p>On <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> fall the king wished the whole case to be submitted to Warham's decision, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused on the ground that his signature of the petition made him an unfit judge. When the whole <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were subjected to a praemunire for having acknowledged <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> legatine authority, the king seized the opportunity to force them to declare him head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Warham proposed an amendment recognizing him as "protector and supreme lord of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and so far as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Christ will allow supreme head". This was carried in default of opposition and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were allowed to purchase their pardon for a large sum. At length Warham awoke to the gravity of the position, and on 24 February, 1532, he formally protested against all Acts of Parliament derogatory to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority or the prerogatives of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. The king incited the parliament to harass the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> with a petition for redress of grievances against his courts. With a flash of his old spirit and ability he returned an able answer, but this did not satisfy either king or parliament, and on 15 May the "submission of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>" was wrung from them. Three months later Warham died, leaving his books to be divided between Winchester, and All Souls and New Colleges at Oxford. He had nothing else to leave, owing to his extreme munificence in supporting <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">public charities</a>, in exercising hospitality and in assisting scholars, such as <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>. His own private life was simple and austere, so that he died "without money and without <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>". His portrait by <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a> is at Lambeth, the original drawing for it being preserved in the king's collection at <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a>.
