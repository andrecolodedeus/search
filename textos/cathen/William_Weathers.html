<h1>William Weathers</h1>  

<p>Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Amyela; born 12 November, 1814; died at Isleworth, Middlesex, 4 March, 1895. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; the mother and children were converted after the father's death. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Baddesley (1823-28), and at Old Hall, where he remained for forty years, and held in turn every office. Before his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (1838) he was already a master (1835). He was prefect of discipline 1840-43, vice-president and <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> 1843-51, prefect of studies for some years, and president 1851-68. His presidency forms a memorable epoch in the history of the college and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in southern <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The years succeeding the restoration of the Hierarchy saw a readjustment of standards. With a view to invigorate the future <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> thought it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the control of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> should be in the hands of his newly-formed congregation, the Oblates of St. Charles; and, under his influence, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> appointed a staff at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">St. Edmund's</a> who were neither desired nor welcomed by the president (1855-56). The result was an attempt to manage the college without the president's co-operation. The Westminster Chapter took up the matter, and, after an appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Oblates were withdrawn in 1861. Dr. Weathers's own appreciation of higher ideals is indicated by the remodelling of the college rules during his presidency, and by the invitation and firm support given to <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Dr. Ward</a>, a convert and a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, as lecturer in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> (1852-58). When <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a> removed the divines to Hammersmith in 1869, he appointed Weathers <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of that <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which position Weathers held until the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was closed by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> in 1892. At his own choice, he then became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Sisters of Nazareth at Isleworth. He had been created D.D. in 1845, became a canon of Westminster in 1851, was named a domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1869, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as auxiliary to <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a>, in 1872. In 1868 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as representative <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the deliberations preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. He published, under the name Amyclanus, An Enquiry into the Nature and Results of Electricity and Magnetism (1876).
