<h1>William and Sylvester Rosecrans</h1>  

<h2>William</h2>

<p>Born at Kingston, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 6 Sept., 1819; died near Redondo <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, 11 March, 1898. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> came originally from <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and settled in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> moving thence to <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. His mother was a daughter of Samuel Hopkins, a soldier of the Revolution and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He graduated at the U. S. Military Academy, West Point, in July 1842, and after a brief service in the engineer corps returned to the Academy as a professor, remaining there until 1847. It was during this period that he <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In 1854 he resigned from the army, but at the breaking out of the Civil War he was made a colonel of volunteers and, in June, 1861, a brigadier-general of regulars. During the succeeding years he held various important commands in <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, until 19 and 20 Sept., 1863, when he was defeated by Gen. Bragg, at the battle of Chickamauga. Then after a short period of service in the department of <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a> he was relieved of all command. Up to this he had been uniformly successful as a good fighter and military strategist. At the close of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he resigned from the army and, in 1868, served as U. S. Minister to Mexico, where from 1869 to 1881 he devoted himself to railroad and industrial enterprises. He was elected to Congress as a Democrat, in 1880, and again in 1882. From 1885 to 1893 he was registrar of the U. S. Treasury. In 1889 Congress restored him to the rank and pay of a brigadier general of the regular army on the retired list.
<h2>Sylvester</h2>

<p>His brother, Sylvester Harden Rosecrans, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">Columbus</a>, was also a convert. Born at Homer, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> 5 Feb., 1827, he was sent to Kenyon College, the leading Episcopalian institution of the state. While there in 1845 he received a letter from his brother William, then a professor at West Point, announcing his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. It so impressed him that he also sought instruction and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. He then went to St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, New York, graduating there in 1846. Electing to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> he was sent by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> as a student to the College of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1852. Returning to Cincinnati he officiated at St. Thomas's church, and was a professor in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In 1859 a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was opened in connection with the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and he was made its president. In 1862 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12226a.htm">Pompeiopolis</a> and Auxiliary of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">Diocese of Columbus</a> was created, 3 March, 1868, he was transferred to that see as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and died there 21 October, 1878 (see <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">DIOCESE OF COLUMBUS</a>). During his residence in Cincinnati he was a frequent editorial contributor to the "Catholic Telegraph".
