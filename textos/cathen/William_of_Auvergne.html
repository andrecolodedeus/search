<h1>William of Auvergne</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. Born at Aurillac in Auvergne towards the end of the twelfth century; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1249. The date of his birth and the circumstances of his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> are unknown. In the first decades of the thirteenth century he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to study, and became successively teacher in the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> and in that of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> (about 1220). In 1228 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, continuing, as his official decrees show, to take an active interest in the institution in which he had studied and taught.

<p>His works include several treatises on practical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, for example, "De virtutibus", "De moribus", "De sacramentis", a dogmatic treatise "De trinitate" (in which there is much that pertains to philosophy as well as to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>), and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works "De universo", "De anima", "De immortalitate animae", the last being merely a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of a work bearing the same title by Dominic Gundisalvi. These were collected and published at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, 1496, and republished at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in 1591, and at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 1674. William of Auvergne represents the first stage of the movement which ended in the adoption and adaptation of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> philosophy as the basis of a systematic exposition of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Christian dogma</a>. It was difficult for him to break all at once with the Augustinian method and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which had prevailed in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> up to this time. Besides, the only text of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> then available was full of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of translation and of perversions on the part of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> commentators. Still he set about the task of rescuing <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> from the Arabians, and although he often failed to find a consistent basis of reconciliation between the Augustinian and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> elements, he did important work in preparing the way for his more fortunate and more successful followers, <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. He did not cover the whole ground of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> as they did; his "De universo" is neither a "Summa theologica", nor a "Book of Sentences"; it is more specifically an attempt to found a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of reality on principles opposed to those of the Arabian School. In his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works he devotes special attention to the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichean heresy</a>, which in his time had been renewed by the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a>. He devoted attention also to refuting the Arabian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the world. In his interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> theory of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> he identifies the intelligible world (<em>Kosous nontos</em>) with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.
