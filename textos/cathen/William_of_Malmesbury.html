<h1>William of Malmesbury</h1>  

<p>Born 30 November, about 1090; died about 1143. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09572c.htm">Malmesbury</a>, where he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. From his youth he showed a special bent towards history, "Thence it came that not being satisfied with the writing of old I began to write myself". By 1125 he had completed his two works, "Gesta Regum" and "Gesta Pontificum". After this he spent ten years in forming a collection of historical and legal materials, now in the Bodleian <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and writing a history of <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a> and its <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in which he speaks as though he were, for the time at least, an inmate of that <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. He records that he might more than once have become <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Malmesbury, but he contented himself with the office of librarian. About 1140 he made revisions of the two works "Gesta Regum" and "Gesta Pontificum", and began a new work "Historia novella", a sequel to the former, dealing with the period 1125-42, but in such a desultory way as to show that we have rather the first draft of a book than a completed work. William's authority as a historian is invaluable for the contemporary reign of Stephen, and his records of the earlier Norman kings, being based either on personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or direct hearsay, are of importance. The "Gesta Pontificum", which owes much to <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, is the source from which all later writers of early <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> have chiefly drawn. His method, also derived from <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, was to recount events so as to show their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect, and in returning to this sound principle he made a great advance on the works of his predecessors. The anecdotes, occasionally irrelevant, which he weaves into his narrative, helped much to preserve its popularity through the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. His chief works have been printed by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/13120a.htm">Rolls Series</a> includes the critical edition.
