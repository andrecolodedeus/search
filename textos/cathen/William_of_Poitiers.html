<h1>William of Poitiers</h1>  

<p>Norman historian, born of a noted <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, at Pr&eacute;aux near Pont Audemer, <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, about 1020. One of his sisters was <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Pr&eacute;aux. About 1040 he went to make his studies at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (whence his surname). After leading the life of a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> and taking part in several battles, he took orders, and became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Duke <a href="../cathen/15642c.htm">William the Conqueror</a>, whose history he resolved to write. Hugh, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lisieux, brought him to his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and appointed him <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. He fulfilled these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> under Hugh and his successor Gilbert Maminot, who had founded a sort of scholarly academy where <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> and mathematical questions were discussed. William was considered one of the best informed men of his time; he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Greek and Latin authors. He lived to an extreme old age, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death being unknown, but it is placed about 1087. He is chiefly known through <a href="../cathen/11278a.htm">Ordericus Vitalis</a> (I, IV, <em>passim</em>), who speaks of his talent for versification and says that he communicated his verses to young students in order to instruct them in the poetic art. His sole extant work is his Life of William the Conqueror, "Gesta Guilelmi II, ducis Normannorum, regis Anglorum I". It exists only in a single <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Cottonian Manuscript, British Museum), almost destroyed, according to which the work has been published (ed. Duchesne, "Norman. Scriptores", 178-213). This work was composed as a single writing, and was offered to King William by the author between 1071 and 1077. The beginning (as far as 1047) and the end of the work (from 1068) are lost. According to <a href="../cathen/11278a.htm">Ordericus Vitalis</a> the account stopped at 1071. As sources he made use of Dudon de St. Quentin and annals now lost. He also interrogated the witnesses of events and reproduced in part personal recollections. Hence his work has the value of a contemporary source based on direct testimonies. Although the style has the pretentious character of the writings of that period, the composition is careful; the tone is that of a panegyric of William. Among the most important passages must be mentioned the sojourn of Harold in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a> and the Conquest of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Unfortunately the first part, dealing with the early life of Duke William, has disappeared. Editions of his work are: A. Duchesne, "Normannorum Scriptores" (Paris, 1619, 178-213), reproduced in P.L., XLIX, 1216-70; Giles, "Scriptores rerum gestarum Willelmi Conquestoris" (London, 1845), 78-159, French tr. Guizot, "Collection de m&eacute;moires relatifs &agrave; l'histoirede France" (Paris, 1826), XXIX.
