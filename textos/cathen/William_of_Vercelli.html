<h1>William of Vercelli</h1>  

<p>(Or WILLIAM OF MONTE VERGINE.)

<p>The founder of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> of <a href="../cathen/10538b.htm">Monte Vergine</a>, or <a href="../cathen/15644b.htm">Williamites</a>, born 1085; died 25 June, 1142. He was the son of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, both of whom died when he was still a child, and his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was entrusted to one of his kinsmen. At the age of fifteen he made up his mind to renounce the world and lead a life of penance. With this end in view, he went on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to St. James of Compostella, and, not content with the ordinary hardships of such a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, he encircled his body with iron bands to increase his suffering. After this journey he started on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land, but it was revealed to him that he would be of greater service to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if he remained in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He built himself a hut on <a href="../cathen/10538b.htm">Monte Vergine</a>, wishing to become a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> and live in solitude, but it was not long before many people flocked to him to put themselves under his guidance, being attracted by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of his life and the many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he performed. Soon a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built, and by 1119 the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/10538b.htm">Monte Vergine</a> was founded. St. William lived at <a href="../cathen/10538b.htm">Monte Vergine</a> until the brethren began to murmur against him, saying that the life was too austere, that he gave too much in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and so on. He therefore decided to leave <a href="../cathen/10538b.htm">Monte Vergine</a> and thus take away from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the cause of their grievances. Roger I of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> took him under his patronage, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> founded many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, both of men and of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, in that kingdom. So edified was the king with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life and the wisdom of his counsels that, in order to have him always near him, he built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> opposite his palace at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>. Knowing by special revelation that his end was at hand, William retired to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Gugieto, where he died, and was buried in the church.
