<h1>William the Walloon</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. (probably) 22 Dec., 1089. He became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Arnoul at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> in 1050. He continued the good traditions of his predecessor, Abbot Warin, in the government of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and devoted his leisure to study, especially of the works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and St. Augustine. On 30 June, 1073, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> wrote to Archbishop Manasses of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, rebuking him for his ill treatment of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St-Remi, and ordering him to procure the election of a suitable <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. William of St-Anoul was elected, but quickly found his position untenable. In spite of promises made to William in person (see his fourth letter), Manasses continued his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and towards the end of 1073 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to secure the acceptance of his resignation. In a letter to Manasses, probably sent by William, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> is very pleasing to him and that he would desire him to retain both abbacies, but that, if he persists in resigning St-Remi, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is to accept his resignation and seek his advice in the election of a successor. In another letter, to Bishop Herimann of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, he informs him that William wishes to return to St-Arnoul, and recommends him to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> charity, "that he may feel that his coming to us has profited him." In the event, Manasses roughly demanded the return of the abbatial <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> and appointed Henry, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Hoimbliere, in William's place, apparently without consulting him. William returned to <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, but some twelve years later, though on friendly terms with Bishop Herimann, weakly allowed himself to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and intruded into the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">See of Metz</a> when the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a> drove out the rightful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in 1085. The following year, however, he sought out Herimann, publicly resigned the dignity he had usurped, and retired to the Abbey of Gorze. Shortly afterwards Herimann restored him to his abbey of St-Arnoul.

<p>Of his writings we have seven letters and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of preparation for Mass in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Augustine. His style is good for the period and shows a considerable <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of literature. The first letter is the well-known address of congratulation to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> on his election to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, reprinted by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> at the beginning of their commentary on the life of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. These remains were discovered by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> at St-Arnoul and first printed by him in his "Analecta vetera", I (Paris, 1675), 247-286.
