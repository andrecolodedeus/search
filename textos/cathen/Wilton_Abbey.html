<h1>Wilton Abbey</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Wiltshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, three miles from <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. A first foundation was made as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> by Earl Wulstan of Wiltshire, about 773, but was after his death (800) changed into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for 12 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> by his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, St. Alburga, sister of King Egbert. Owing to the consent given by this king he is counted as the first founder of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. St. Alburga herself joined the community, and died at Wilton. <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">King Alfred</a>, after his temporary success against the Danes at Wilton in 871, founded a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> on the site of the royal palace and united to it the older foundation. The community was to number 26 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Wilton is best known as the home of St. Edith, the child of a "handfast" union between Edgar, King of the English (944-75), and Wulfrid, a lady wearing the veil though not a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, whom he carried off from Wilton probably in 961. After Edith's birth, Wulfrid refused to enter into a permanent marriage with Edgar and retired with her child to Wilton. Edith, who appears to have been learned, received the veil while a child, at the hands of <a href="../cathen/05555b.htm">Bishop Ethelwold of Winchester</a>, and at the age of fifteen refused the abbacy of three houses offered by her father. She built the Church of St. Denis at Wilton, which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>, and died shortly afterwards at the age of twenty-three (984). Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is on 16 September. St. Edith became the chief patron of Wilton, and is sometimes said to have been <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. In 1003 Sweyn, King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, destroyed the town of Wilton, but we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> shared its fate. Edith, the wife of Edward the Confessor, who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Wilton, rebuilt in stone the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which had formerly been of wood. In 1143 King Stephen made it his headquarters, but was put to flight by Matilda's forces under Robert of Gloucester. The <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Wilton held an entire barony from the king, a privilege shared by only three other <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a>, Shaftesbury, Barking, and St. Mary, Winchester. Cecily Bodenham, the last <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, surrendered her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> on 25 March, 1539. The site was granted to Sir William Herbert, afterwards Earl of <a href="../cathen/11611a.htm">Pembroke</a>, who commenced the building of Wilton House, still the abode of his descendants. There are no remains of the ancient buildings.
