<h1>Wimborne Minster</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also</em> WIMBURN or WINBURN).

<p>Located in Dorsetshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Between the years 705-23 a <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">double monastery</a> like the famous house of <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">St. Hilda</a> at Whitby was founded at Wimborne by Sts. Cuthburga and Quimburga (feast 31 Aug.), sisters of Ine, King of the West Saxons (688-726). The discipline of Wimborne which followed the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> was especially severe in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns'</a> enclosure, into which not even <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were allowed to enter. Under the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> St. Tetta, there were a large number of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, among them St. Lioba, who was summoned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> to govern the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Bischoffsheim, and her companion <a href="../cathen/14563a.htm">St. Thecla</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Kitzingen. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was probably destroyed by raiding Danes in the ninth century: every trace of the Saxon buildings has vanished and even the site of St. Cuthburga's Church is uncertain.

<p>Secular canons were established at Wimborne either by King Edward the Confessor or one of his predecessors of the same name. The church was collegiate and a royal free <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and is so entered in Domesday Book. The list of the deans, who were of royal appointment, exists from 1224 to 1547. The establishment numbered 17 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, a dean, 4 <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a>, 3 vicars, 4 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and 5 singing men. The deanery was in every case held in conjunction with some more important office. <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a> was Dean of Wimborne from 1517 to 1537, being but 17 years of age on his appointment. In 1547 the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was suppressed. The minster is now the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. Its extreme length is 198 feet. The width, exclusive of the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>, varies from 23 feet in the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> to 21 in the choir and presbytery. There is a western tower 95 feet in height, and another above the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> (84 feet). The thirteenth-century spire which formerly <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> this latter tower fell in 1600. The present church is the result of gradual growth during the church-building centuries up to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, without any of the great rebuilding operations such as took place in churches possessing popular shrines or great revenues. The church has suffered considerably at the hands of nineteenth-century restorers. It contains the beautiful altar-tomb of John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and Margaret his wife, the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of the celebrated Lady Margaret, Foundress of Christ's and St. John's Colleges at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, and mother of King Henry VII. A small chained <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1686 occupies a room over the vestry.
