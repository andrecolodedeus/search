<h1>Windesheim</h1>  

<p>An Augustinian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> situated about four miles south of Zwolle on the Issel, in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Kingdom of Holland</a>. The congregation of canons regular, of which this was the chief house, was an offshoot of the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">Brethren of the Common Life</a> and played a considerable part in the reforming movement within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during the century which preceded the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">Brethren of the Common Life</a>, who did not form an order or congregation strictly so called, had become obnoxious to the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a>, and the object of their attacks. To remedy this, <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Gerard Groot</a>, when on his deathbed (1384), advised that some of the brethren should adopt the rule of an approved order (Chron. Wind., 263). His successor, <a href="../cathen/12631b.htm">Florence Radewyns</a>, carried this advice into effect. Six of the brethren, carefully chosen as specially fitted for the work, among them John, elder brother of <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, were sent to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Eymsteyn (founded 1382) to learn the usages of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>. In 1386 they erected huts for a temporary <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Windesheim, and in March of the following year commenced the building of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church, which were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Hubert Lebene, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> and auxiliary of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, on 17 Oct., 1387. At the same time the six brethren took their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The real founder of the greatness of Windesheim was Johann Vos, the second prior (1391-1424), under whom the number of religious was greatly increased and many foundations were made. The first of these were Marienborn near Arnheim and Niewlicht near Hoorn (1392). These two houses with Eymsteyn and the mother-house were the first members of the congregation or chapter (<em>capitulum</em>) as it was then called. It was approved and received certain privileges from <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> in 1395. The constitutions added to the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> were approved by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>. An annual general chapter was held at Windesheim "after the fashion of the brethren of the Carthusian Order", at which all the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> proffered their resignation. The <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Windesheim was the superior prior, or head of the congregation, with considerable powers. After 1573 a prior-general was elected from among the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The choir Office at first followed in general the Ordinarium of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> (for the reform of the Windesheim <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> by Radulfus de Rivo, Dean of Tongres, see Mohlbeg, op. cit. infra). The Windesheim <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> was printed at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1546.

<p>The life of the canons was strict, but not over-severe; we are told that a <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulant</a> was asked if he could sleep well, eat well, and obey well, "since these three points are the foundation of stability in the monastic life". The constitutions exhibit in many points the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. The canons wore a black hood and <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>, with a white tunic and <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> were dressed in gray.

<p>By 1407 the congregation numbered twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In 1413 it was joined by the seven Brabant houses of the Groenendael congregation, of which the famous mystic <a href="../cathen/13280c.htm">Ruysbroek</a> had been a member, and in 1430 by the twelve houses of the Congregation of Neuss in the <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>. When the Windesheim Congregation reached the height of its prosperity towards the end of the fifteenth century, it numbered eighty-six houses of canons, and sixteen of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, mostly situated in what is now the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of Cologne. Those which survived the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (they still numbered 32 in 1728) were suppressed at the end of the eighteenth or beginning of the nineteenth century. Uden in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> is the only survivor at the present day (Heimbucher, 11, 43). The destruction of Windesheim itself began in 1572, when the altars in the church were destroyed by the people of Zwolle; the suppression came in 1581. There are now practically no remains of the buildings. The last <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Windesheim, Marcellus Lentius (d. 1603), never obtained possession of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.

<p>The Windesheimers numbered many writers, besides copyists and illuminators. Their most famous author was <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>. Besides <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works, they also produced a number of chronicles, of which we may mention the "Chronicle of Windesheim" by Johann Busch. An emendation of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text and of the text of various Fathers was also undertaken. Gabriel Biel, "the last German scholastic", was a member of the congregation. A number of books were translated into German, and, besides the regular monastic <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of German works was established in each house for lending to the people. The chief historical importance of the Windesheim Canons lies in their reforming work. This was not confined to the reform of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but was extended to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, whom they especially sought to bring to greater devotion toward the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and more <a href="../cathen/06278a.htm">frequent communion</a>. The chief of the Windesheim monastic reformers was Johann Busch (b. 1399; d. 1480). This remarkable man was clothed at Windesheim in 1419. At the chapter of 1424 Prior Johann Vos, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his own end was near, especially entrusted Busch and Hermann Kanten with the carrying out of his work of reform (Chron. Wind., 51). Grube gives a list of forty-three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (twenty-seven Augustinian, eight <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, five <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>, and three Pre-monstratensian), in whose reform Busch had a share; perhaps his greatest conquest was the winning to the side of reform of Johann Hagen, for thirty years (1439-69) <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bursfeld and the initiator of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation known as the Union of Bursfeld. In 1451 Busch was entrusted by his friend <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, with the reform of the North German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and with such labours he was busied till shortly before his death.

<p>Similar work on a smaller scale was carried out by other Windesheimers. Some <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers have claimed the Windesheim reformers as forerunners of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. This is a misapprehension of the whole spirit of the canons of Windesheim; their object was the reform of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, not the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The conduct of the communities of Windesheim and Mount St. Agnes, who preferred exile to the non-observance of an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> published by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, exemplifies their spirit of obedience to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
