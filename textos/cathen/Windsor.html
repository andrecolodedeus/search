<h1>Windsor</h1>  

<p>A town of great antiquity, on the Thames, in Berkshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; quaintly rendered <em>Ventus Morbidus</em> in some <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> documents, the name being really from the Saxon <em>Windels-or</em>, "winding shore". The manor was granted by <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">St. Edward the Confessor</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Abbey of Westminster</a>, and the town became a free borough under Edward I. The chief interest of Windsor lies in the castle, one of the most famous royal residences in the world. There was a palace and stronghold here in the time of the <a href="../cathen/07241d.htm">Saxon Heptarchy</a>, and the great mound on which stands the Round Tower (itself rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a>) is of this date. The castle, which was extensively added to by Henry III, has been for centuries the favourite residence of English kings, many of whom, including <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> and Henry VI, were born there. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> existed in the castle from early times; but the present sumptuous Chapel of St. George, considered the finest example of perpendicular architecture in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was built by Edward IV, who was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in it, as were several of his successors. St. Edward's (now the Albert Memorial) Chapel was the burial place of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, who constructed a magnificent <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> for himself. This <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was used for <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Catholic worship</a> in the reign of James II, who received the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> there in 1687. Under George IV nearly a million sterling was spent on altering and practically rebuilding the castle, according to the plans of Wyatville. Many royal <a href="../cathen/09703b.htm">marriages</a> have taken place during the last century in St. George's Chapel, which is a richly-endowed royal peculiar, served by a <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of canons and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor clerics</a>, and a staff of highly-trained choristers. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is the headquarters of the Knights of the Garter (established by <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a>), for whom a special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is said at every service held within its walls.
