<h1>Winifred Maxwell</h1>  

<p>Countess of Nithsdale, d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, May, 1749. She was the daughter of William, first Marquis of Powis, who followed James II into exile. She is famous in history for the heroic deliverance of her <a href="../cathen/10081b.htm">husband</a> from the Tower on 23 Feb., 1716. Her married life was passed chiefly at the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> seat of Terregles, and here she received the fatal news of her <a href="../cathen/10081b.htm">husband's</a> defeat at Preston. After concealing the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> papers in a spot still pointed out, she hastened to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercede</a> for her <a href="../cathen/10081b.htm">husband</a>, having little hope however, for, to use her own words: "A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> upon the borders and one who had a great following and whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> had ever upon all occasions stuck to the royal family, could not look for mercy". And so it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; even her personal appeal to George I was disregarded, and <a href="../cathen/10081b.htm">Lord Nithsdale</a> was to owe his safety to her alone. With great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and ingenuity she contrived his escape from the Tower in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> dress &#151; on the <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">eve</a> of the day appointed for his <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a>, according to Lady Cowper's "Diary," 1st ed., p. 85, a reprieve was signed for <a href="../cathen/10081b.htm">Lord Nithsdale</a> on the very night of his escape &#151; and after concealing him in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and arranging for his journey to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, this heroic lady returned again to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> to secure the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> papers which she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> would be of vital importance to her son. In fact her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> made Lady Nithsdale's position a hazardous one, and King George declared she had done him "more mischief than any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>". As soon as she was able she joined <a href="../cathen/10081b.htm">Lord Nithsdale</a> abroad and they spent their long exile in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where she survived her <a href="../cathen/10081b.htm">husband</a> for about five years. The autograph letter in which Lady Nithsdale gives the account of her <a href="../cathen/10081b.htm">husband's</a> escape, and the brown cloak worn by him on the occasion, are now in possession of the Duchess of Norfolk, who represents the Nithsdales in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> line.
