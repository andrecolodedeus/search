<h1>Witness</h1>  

<p>One who is present, bears testimony, furnishes evidence or <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Witnesses are employed in various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, as in civil, in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a statement, fact, or contract. According to various circumstances a witness is one who is personally present and sees some act or occurrence and can bear testimony thereto; one who on request or in behalf of a party subscribes his name to an instrument to attest the genuineness of its execution; one who gives testimony on the trial of a cause, appearing before a court, judge, or other official to be examined under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. The espousals of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> ("Ne temere") to be binding must be in writing, signed by the contracting parties and ordinarily by two witnesses, or by a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> or ordinary, each within his own territory, as sole witnesses. In case either or both parties are unable for any cause to write, an additional witness is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are incapable of entering into lawful wedlock ("Ne temere") except in the presence of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or ordinary, or other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> duly delegated, and two witnesses. Though not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for validity of the act, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> desires in both cases that these witnesses be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (S.O., 19 Aug., 1891). Witnesses of a marriage sign no <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> document, though they may be called upon by the state to attest by their own hand certain civil records. Sponsors at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and confirmation are not properly witnesses; they assist for other purposes (see <a href="../cathen/12731b.htm">RELATIONSHIP</a>). A canonical precept, when employed, must be delivered in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a> or two others as witnesses (Cum magnopere, VII). Ecclesiastical documents are attested or witnessed as circumstances require, e.g., by the chancellor, clerk of the court, prothonotary apostolic. Expert witnesses to some extent have a place in canon law. In <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> trials witnesses are adduced to prove a fact directly, or indirectly, i.e., by establishing the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of the contrary.

<p>The essential qualifications of a witness are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the fact at issue and truthfulness: he must be an eye-witness and trustworthy. Hearsay witnesses, however, are admitted, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in matters not of a criminal nature, e.g., in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> or other relationship, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, etc. Anyone not expressly prohibited may testify. Some, as the insane, infants, the blind or deaf, where sight or hearing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the facts in question, are excluded by the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>; others by canon law, as those who are bribed or suborned, those who are <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> in law or in fact, convicted <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurors</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, all in a word whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> may be justly suspected. The law likewise rejects those who on account of affection or enmity may be biased, as well as those who may be specially interested in the case. Parents as a rule are not admitted for their children, particularly when the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a third party are at stake, or against them and vice-versa; relatives for one another; lawyers for their clients; accomplices or enemies for or against one another; <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a> against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, except their own interests are at stake, or there are no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to testify; minors or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in criminal cases tried criminally, unless their testimony is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, or they testify in favor of the accused. Clerics, unless compelled by <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>, are not allowed to testify against the accused when sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> is to be imposed (see <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">IRREGULARITY</a>). There are many exceptions to these general statements. A witness is more easily admitted in favour of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than against him, and in civil than in criminal trials. No one is tolerated as a witness in his own case. Hence, those who are engaged in a similar cause, a judge who has adjudicated a like case, etc. are excluded. False witnesses are those who under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> prevaricate or conceal the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that they are bound to tell: they are guilty of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, and if convicted are <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> in law. Notaries or others by altering or falsifying documents substantially become guilty of <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/05542d.htm">ESPOUSALS</a>; <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">PROOF</a>; <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">EXAMINATION</a>.)
