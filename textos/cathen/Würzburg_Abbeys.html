<h1>W&uuml;rzburg Abbeys</h1>  

<p><em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">DIOCESE OF W&Uuml;RZBURG</a> <em>and</em> <a href="../cathen/15720a.htm">UNIVERSITY OF W&Uuml;RZBURG ABBEYS</a>;

<p>The city of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> was the seat of four <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, namely, the Holy Redeemer's, or <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian's</a>; St. Andrew's, later known as St. Burchard's; St. Stephen's; and the Scotch Abbey of St. James.
<h2>Abbey of the Holy Redeemer (S. Salvatoris)</h2>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, also called after <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a>, who was buried there, was founded by St. Burchard, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, about 745. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had charge of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (Salvatorm&uuml;nster) and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The latter gained considerable renown. Probably owing to laxity in observance of the rule, Bishop Bernwelf of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> replaced the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in 786 by canons who led a common life and were popularly styled Brothers of <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a>. The expelled <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, more than fifty in number, found a home at the Abbey of Neustadt on the Main, where Bishop Megingaud, who had resigned the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">See of W&uuml;rzburg</a>, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>.
<h2>St. Andrew's Abbey (afterwards St. Burchard's)</h2>

<p>St. Andrew's was founded by St. Burchard shortly after 748, and soon became famous for its <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. After a period of decline in the tenth century it was reformed in 988 by Bishop Hugo of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, who rebuilt the church and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and placed Arnold, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Hirasu, as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> over it. On 14 October, 984, this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had transferred thither the body of St. Burchard, and from that time the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became known as St. Burchard's Abbey. Church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> having been destroyed by fire about 1030, Abbot Wilemuth rebuilt both (1033- 42), and in 1042 Bishop <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> dedicated the new church in presence of <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a> and six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Yielding to the request of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 4 February, 1464, changed the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church into a collegiate church, and permitted the former <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to remain as canons.
<h2>St. Stephen's Abbey</h2>

<p>Founded by Henry of Rothenburg, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, about 1013, for canons who followed the Rule of <a href="../cathen/03729b.htm">St. Chrodegang</a>. In 1057 Bishop Adalbero replaced the canons by thirty <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Ansbach. After a short period of decline in the first half of the fifteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> joined the Bursfeld reform in 1459. After suffering another period of decline in the latter half of the sixteenth century, it continued in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> until its secularization in 1803. Since then the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> have been used as a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The historian Ignaz Gropp (1695-1758) was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Stephen's. He wrote the history of several Franconian <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and edited "Collectio novissima scriptorum et rerum Wireceburgensium a saecula XVI hactenus gestarum" (4 vols., Frankfort and <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 1741-50).
<h2>St. James's Abbey (St. Jakob zu den Schotten)</h2>

<p>Founded as a Scotch <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by Bishop Embrico of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> about 1134. Its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was Bl. Macarius (1139-53) who with a few other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had come from the Scotch <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. In 1146 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He died in 1153, and has always been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 24 January. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at St. James's were all <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> or Scotch until 1497, when their number had dwindled down to one or two. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was then given over to German <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and in 1506 it was united to the Bursfeld Congregation. From 1506-16 the famous <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Johannes Trithemius</a> was its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. In 1547 the whole <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had died out, and its revenues went to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. Upon the request of John Whyte, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Scotch <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, it was again restored to the Scotch <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by Bishop Julius in 1595, and prospered for some time. Its last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Placidus Hamilton, who, though very learned, lacked the qualities of a good ruler, resigned and retired to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1763. From that time till its secularization in 1803 it was ruled by <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>. At its secularization it numbered eight <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The buildings are now used as a military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>.
