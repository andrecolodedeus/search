<h1>Xaverian Brothers</h1>  

<p>(CONGREGATION OF THE BROTHERS OF ST. FRANCIS XAVIER).

<p>An institute of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, founded under episcopal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> by <a href="../cathen/13284a.htm">Theodore James Ryken</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, in the year 1839. To obtain the views of American <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> as to the merits of his project to establish a teaching congregation, he came to America (1837), and received approval from seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who gave him testimonial letters. Returning to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, he laid his plan before Mgr Boussens, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, who granted his sanction on condition that <a href="../cathen/13284a.htm">Ryken</a> should first make a year's <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> under the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> at St-Trond. After completing the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> <a href="../cathen/13284a.htm">Ryken</a> established his congregation at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. From the beginning trials and difficulties threatened the existence of the new institute. Subjects did not come or failed to persevere, and the means of subsistence were to be had only by painful effort. In June 1840, the brotherhood consisted of three members. In the following year the generosity of a banker of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, Dujardin, enabled the community to purchase the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> known as "Het Walletje", from the moat that surrounded it, and here the brothers established their mother-house. An unknown benefactor also left a considerable sum of money with the request that it be devoted to helping missionary work. The words of Sallust, "Concordia res parvae crescunt", were adopted by the brothers as their motto. A boys' sodality was opened at Het Walletje, followed shortly by a primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the same place; the work of catechizing was taken up at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Notre-Dame, and some attention was given to the training of deaf-mutes. The brothers' first grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> (1844) and in the following year a second <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the same rank was established there. Already the progressive character of the youthful institute was shown by its sending several members to St-Trond Normal School for higher professional training. In 1846 the brothers were called to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was begun at <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury</a>, Lancashire, but in 1856 the community removed to <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>. It was at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> that the brothers popularized the May devotions, and promoted the wearing of the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> of Mount Carmel.

<p>On 10 July, 1854, the founder sailed from Havre to take the direction of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, at the invitation of Bishop Martin J. Spalding, who had long desired the Xaverians to come to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The pioneers were Brothers Paul, Hubert, Stanislaus, Stephen, and Bernardine. The Xaverians took charge of several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> there, and finally (1864) opened an institution under their own auspices, which still exists as St. Xavier's College, and had an attendance of five hundred students in 1910. When Bishop Spalding became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (1864), he invited the congregation to conduct St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys. The Xaverians decided to make Baltimore the centre of their activities in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and they purchased a site just beyond the western limits of the city, where in 1876 a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was opened. The first general chapter was held at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> (1869); meanwhile the brothers were extending their work in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. They had established a house for <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> at Hammersmith (1861), near the Normal Training College, in order that the young members might follow the courses there. Two years later a new mission was accepted. The Duchess of <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>, an American of the Caton <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, had just founded an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at Hastings, Sussex, and the Xaverians were asked to take charge. By a coincidence, the land on which St. Mary's Industrial School, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, stands is known as the Duchess of <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a> estate. The foundation at Hastings was removed to Mayfield, and was gradually diverted from its original plan as an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, and became a successful boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which has at present several fine buildings. The main structure, Gothic in its features, was designed by <a href="../cathen/12558b.htm">Pugin</a>. Clapham College, adjoining Clapham Common, London, has developed from a small beginning made in the early sixties, to an influential position among English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges. It is a centre for the Oxford local examinations. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Collegiate Institute, as the brothers' principal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> is called, was removed to an attractive site at <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a> Park, in the suburbs of that city, in 1905. The following year a new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened. Since 1875 <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> has formed one of the three provinces into which the institute was then divided; American and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> being the other two. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the brothers founded, in connection with the mother-house, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Institut St. Francoios-Xavier, which has at present (1911) over seven hundred students. Other houses were founded at Thourout, Huthoulst, Heyst, and Zedelghem.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the congregation has made its greatest gains. The membership in the American province (1911) numbers 127 professed, 19 scholastics, 21 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 20 aspirants. The Xaverian missions in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> comprise 5 colleges, 6 academies, 15 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 5 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 4 homes for boys. At Baltimore, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, is Mt. St. Joseph's College, adjoining the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Archdiocese of Boston</a>, which the congregation entered in 1882, it conducts <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Lowell, Lawrence, Somerville, East Boston, Danvers, and Newton Highlands. Other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> are at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and Milbury. At Manchester, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, and at Deep River, <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, are Xaverian missions also. The <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Diocese of Richmond</a> has a number of institutions under the care of the brothers &#151; two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Old Point Comfort, and academies at Norfolk, <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a>, and Newport News. In the <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Diocese of Wheeling</a> there are two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>: the Cathedral High School, and Elm Grove Training School. Besides St. Xavier's College, the city of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a> has three smaller establishments managed by the institute. In Detroit, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, they conduct a boy's home. To as great an extent as possible the brothers engage in secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> work, regarding this as their particular sphere; though it is found advantageous to undertake <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> also. A notable secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> conducted by the Xaverians is St. John's Preparatory College, Danvers, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, established in 1906.

<p>Since its foundation the institute has had three superiors-general: the founder, Brother Francis, who resigned in 1860; Brother Vincent (1860-96); and from 1896, Brother John Chrysostom. The American province has had three <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>: Brother Alexius, from 1875 to 1900; Brother Dominic, from 1900 to 1907; and Brother Isidore, chosen in 1907. The entire congregation is under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>; and it is governed by its constitution and by a rule similar to that practised by other religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, having simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The constitution of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> provides that all its members shall be <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>; no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are admitted to membership. The brothers are to bind themselves by the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion, and are to dedicate themselves to the instruction of youth, in any country to which they may be sent, and in which they may live according to the spirit of their congregation. Its members are not restricted to teaching elementary branches. Candidates for membership are admitted as <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> for three months if they have attained their sixteenth year; younger applicants are rated as aspirants, and their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and training are provided for until they are old enough to become <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulant</a> completes his term he begins, if he is deemed a satisfactory subject, a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of two years. Then the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are taken. These <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are final. After five years as a professed member the Xaverian brother may make application to take a fourth <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability &#151; by which he binds himself more closely to the congregation, and becomes eligible for superiorship, and to act as delegate to the general chapter, which is held every six years and acquires the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to vote for the elective offices. The superior-general is elected by delegates chosen by the brothers who have the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability. His term of office is for six years, and he is eligible for re-election. The <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> are nominated by the superior-general, assisted by the suffrages of the brothers of the province concerned, without being bound, however, to appoint the one receiving the most votes. The <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> have the same term of office as the superior-general, and may be re-appointed. The superior-general, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>, and local superiors are assisted in their administrative work by councils, two or three members to a council. Father Van Kerkhoven, S.J., an early friend of the congregation, framed the Rule of the Xaverian Brothers. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> granted a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of encouragement to the superior-general, Brother Vincent, on the occasion of the latter's visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1865. According to the terms of the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> "Conditae a Christo", such recognition ranks the institute with the approved congregations.
