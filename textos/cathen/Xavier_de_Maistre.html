<h1>Xavier de Maistre</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> romance writer, younger brother of <a href="../cathen/09554a.htm">Joseph-Marie, Comte de Maistre</a>, b. at Chambery, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, in 1763; d. at St. Petershurg, 12 June, 1852. Being an officer in the <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a> Army when <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> was reunited to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1792, he became expatriated like his brother. In 1799 he was in the Austro-Russian army in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He followed General Suvaroff to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, but, his protector having fallen into disgrace, was reduced to earn his living by <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, being a landscape artist of great ability. The arrival of his brother Joseph as envoy extraordinary of the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, changed his situation. He entered the Admiralty Office and became in 1805, librarian of the Admiralty Museum; he was then named to the staff of the army, took part in the Caucasian War, was made a general, and married a lady-in-waiting of the Empress. From that time he looked on himself as a Russian subject. He did not visit <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> again till 1825. After a short stay in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1839; he returned to St. Petersburg, where he died at the age of eighty-nine.

<p>It may be said that de Maistre became a writer by chance. When a young officer at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, he was arrested for <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duelling</a>. Having been sentenced to remain in his quarters for forty-two days he composed his "Voyage autour de ma chambre". He added some chapters later, but did not judge the work worthy of being published; but his brother, however, having read the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, had it printed (1794). It is a delightful chat with the reader, filled with delicate observations, in which an artless grace, humour, and spontaneous wit are wedded to a gentle and somewhat dreamy philosophy. In 1811 appeared "Le L&eacute;preux de la cit&eacute; d'Aoste". This little dialogue, of about thirty pages, between an isolated <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> and a passing soldier (the author), breathes of touching spirit of resignation, and unites an impressive simplicity of form with suppressed emotion and exalted moral and religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. It is a little gem, a masterpiece. The same must be said of the two novels published some years later: "Les prisonniers du Caucase" and "La jeune Sib&eacute;rienne". In the former the author relates the vicissitudes of the captivity of Major Kascambo, who has fallen, with his ordnance, into an ambuscade. "La jeune Sib&eacute;rienne" is the story of a young girl who comes from <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a> to St. Petersburg to ask for the pardon of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. It is the fact round which Madame Cottin has woven her romance "Elisabeth, ou les exil&eacute;s de la Sib&eacute;rie", but the story of Xavier de Maistre is by far the truer to life and more pathetic. In 1825 de Maistre wrote, as a pendant to his first work, in the same vein, and with the same charm, the "Exp&eacute;dition nocturne autour de ma chambre."

<p>Xavier de Maistre, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, has written only booklets, but these booklets are masterpieces of their kind. His style is ingenious, graceful, and brilliant, while its simplicity, lucidity, and rhythm wonderfully enhance its charm for readers. He may be regarded as one of the first among French authors of the second rank.
