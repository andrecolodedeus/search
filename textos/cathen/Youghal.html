<h1>Youghal</h1>  

<p>The Wardenship of Youghal, in the <a href="../cathen/04072a.htm">Diocese of Cloyne</a>, was founded by Thomas, Eighth Earl of Desmond, the charter being <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 Dec., 1464, and was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It was endowed with a large number of rectories and vicarages in the <a href="../cathen/04072a.htm">Diocese of Cloyne</a>, and also had four vicarages in Ardfert. By the terms of the foundation, the wardenship consisted of a warden, eight fellows, and eight singing-men (vicars choral), and the <a href="../cathen/05421b.htm">endowment</a> was about &pound;600 per annum. Three years later the noble founder was hanged by the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (15 Feb. 1468), and a stormy period ensued on account of the Wars of the Roses, in which the Earls of Desmond were involved. The ninth earl was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by his own servants on 7 Dec., 1487. Two years later the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04072a.htm">Cloyne</a> resigned; and his successor, Blessed Thady MacCarthy (<a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1895), died in exile as a <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessor</a> at <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a> (24 Oct., 1492). The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> warden was Thomas Allen (1533), after whom came the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Roger Skiddy, who had various preferments under Edward VI, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">Dean</a> of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> by Queen Elizabeth in 1562. He is described as "Warden of Youghal" in 1567. Sixty years later all the endowments were acquired by the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Earl of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and in 1639 the rectory was united to the wardenship. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> succession of wardens was maintained as late as 1709, when Father Richard Harnet held the position, which was then merely titular. The warden's house is now the picturesque residence of Sir Henry A. Blake, and is more generally known as "Sir Walter Raleigh's House".
