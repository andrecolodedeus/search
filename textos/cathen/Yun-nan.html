<h1>Yun-nan</h1>  

<p>The Mission of Yun-nan includes the whole Province of Yun-nan which is situated in the southwestern corner of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. It adjoins Tonkin, <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, and the Chinese provinces of Sz-Chuen, Kwei chou, and Kwang-si. It is mountainous and its climate is like that of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It has about 18,000,000 inhabitants, mostly Chinese, divided into many different tribes, as Y-jen, Miao-tse, Lo-los, Shans, Lissous. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> population is 900,000.

<p>In 1658 Yun-nan was entrusted to the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the <a href="../cathen/14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Bishop Pallu, who had no means at his disposal to evangelize it. In 1699, Father Leblanc was made <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. He arrived there in 1702 accompanied by Father Danry. They found only four <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whom they used as catechists. Father Leblanc settled at Yun-nan-sen, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the province, bought a piece of ground, and began building a church. Father Danry by 1706 had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> more than 1000 Chinese. In that year, Emperor Kang-hsi banished the missionaries and Father Danry left <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, while Father Leblanc sought concealment in Fokien and Tch&eacute;-kiang; he died in 1720, shortly after being made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Troad. Bishop Enjobert de Marillat, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Sz-Chuen, administrated Yun-nan till 1780 when Yun-nan was united to Sz-chuen and Father Gleyo went to Yun-nan, where he established many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities. In 1810, Yun-nan was separated from Sz-Chuen. Mgr. Ponsot became <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philomedia (1843-1880). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population at this time was 4000. There was only one <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1847 a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> stopped the progress of evangelization. In 1856 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> numbered 6597. The Treaty of Pekin was not published in Yun-nan until 1865. In 1874 Father Baptifaud was killed at Pien-kio by the rebels. In 1881 Father Terrasse and fourteen <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were massacred at Chang-yu, and 20 Dec., 1910, Father M&eacute;rigot was killed at Tsing-in. The present <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> is Mgr. De Gorostarzu, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aila in 1907. He resides at Yun-nan-sen.

<p>In 1889 the mission comprised 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 25 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries, 7 <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 53 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 25 students, and 10,221 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1910, there were 2 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 31 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries, 15 <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 92 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 21 students, and 102 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 2112 pupils and 12,234 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
