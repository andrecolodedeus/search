<h1>Yuracar&eacute; Indians</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivian</a> tribe living between Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Cochabamba in the wooded regions and plains adjoining the mountains, on the Eastern slopes of the Andes, close to the R&iacute;o Beni and Rio Marmor&eacute;. They are tall, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are very handsome. They have oval countenances, aquiline noses, very dark eyes, while their skin is almost as white as that of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. The Yuracar&eacute; are excellent hunters and make good warriors; they were of a roving disposition, but the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12688b.htm">Paraguayan Reductions</a> succeeded in establishing a mission among them, which flourished until the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a>. The standard of morality among the Yuracar&eacute; was very low. The marriage bond was readily dissolved, but <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> was not practised. They were distributed in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, living without any form of government. Men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were separated at meals, but there was no subordination between husband and wife or relatives, though the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were generally treated as slaves by the children.

<p>They were an extremely <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> race, but they adored neither nature nor a superior being. They believed in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but had no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of future rewards or punishments. The dead, who were mourned for a long period, were buried with their bows and arrows, as they were supposed to have gone to a delightful region under the earth, where the woods abounded with peccaries and the hunting never failed. The Yuracar&eacute; live entirely by hunting; they consider it lawful to commit <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>, and practice <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duelling</a>, which is carried out according to rules laid down by <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a>. They make it a rule never to advise their children, leaving them to form their own standard of conduct.
