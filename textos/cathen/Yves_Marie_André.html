<h1>Yves Marie Andr&eacute;</h1>  

<p>Mathematician, b. 22 May, 1675, at Chateaulin, in Lower Brittany; d. at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, 25 February, 1764. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1693. Although distinguished in his scholastic studies, he was, on account of his Gallicanism, <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesianism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, assigned to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies and made royal professor of mathematics at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a> where he remained for thirty-nine years. A literary essay on "The Beautiful" won him great fame, and is considered a classic. During his lifetime the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and religious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which he could not express as a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> were openly espoused when he was secularized. He condemned his former associates for their action against <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a>, and was a strong anti-Ultramontane. He was intimately associated with <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>, and kept up an extensive correspondence with him. While in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> his Gallicanism and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> made it impossible to appoint him to any responsible office. He obstinately refused to change his views. On the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a> he withdrew to the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of Caen, and the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> provided him with a pension. Although his best work by far is his "Essay on the Beautiful", there is considerable ability in his "Trait&eacute; de l'homme". He wrote a poem on the "Art of Conversation", which was translated into English in 1777. Several posthumous works were published, among which was one with the curious title, "Man as a static Machine; a Hydraulic Machine; a Pneumatic Machine; and a Chemical Machine". Though the work was never found, it is pretty certain that he wrote a "A Life of Malebranche". Victor Cousin had much to do with publishing the posthumous letters of Father Andr&eacute;, to whom we owe as many as eighteen works, some of them in folio, on <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, hydrography, optics, physics, civil and military architecture, along with treatises on literary subjects, sermons, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instructions, etc.
