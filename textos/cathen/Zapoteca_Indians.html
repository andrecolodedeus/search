<h1>Zapoteca Indians</h1>  

<p>A powerful and numerous Mexican tribe located chiefly in <a href="../cathen/11180a.htm">Oaxaca</a> and Guerrero, forming with the Mixteca and Mazateca the Zapotecan linguistic stock. At the time of the conquest of Mexico they were independent of the <a href="../cathen/02169b.htm">Aztec</a>, whom they resembled in customs; they were defeated by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> only after several campaigns between 1522 and 1527, not submitting finally till 1551. They were a sedentary race and well advanced in civilization, living in large villages and towns, in houses constructed with stone and mortar. They recorded the principal events in their history by means of hieroglyphics, and in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> they made use of a cotton armour. The well-known ruins of Mitla have been attributed to them and were claimed by them to be the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of their ancestors.

<p>They had an elaborate religious system, and human <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered. The modern Zapotecas are very intelligent, progressive, and hard-working; they make good soldiers and political leaders, and are excellent citizens. Benito Juarez, President of Mexico, was a full-blooded Zapoteca. They number almost 300,000, and with their kinsmen 750,000. Many of them still speak only their native Indian language. Though they are now <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, some of their ancient <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices, such as burying money with the dead, still survive. The first missionaries among the Zapotecas were Bartolom&eacute; de Olmeda, a <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarian</a>, and Juan D&iacute;az, a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the natives in Quechula near Tepeaca for having overthrown their idols.
