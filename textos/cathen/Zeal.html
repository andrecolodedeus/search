<h1>Zeal</h1>  

<p>(From <em>delos</em>, a derivative of <em>deo</em> "to boil", to "throb with heat"), is "a necessary effect of love", being "the vehement movement of one who loves to [secure] the object of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>" (<em>vehemens motus amantis in rem amatam</em>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/2028.htm#article4">Summa Theol. I-II:28:4</a>). Here the distinctive note is in the vehemence, or intensity, of the action to which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> impels, an intensity which is proportioned to that of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> felt. As there is two kinds of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the <em>amor concupiscentiae</em>, which is self-regarding, and the <em>amor amicitiae</em>, which is altruistic, two corresponding kinds of zeal might be distinguished, but by usage the term is restricted to the zeal prompted by the amor amicitiae; indeed in its religious sense it is applied solely to the zeal inspired by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the ardent endeavours and works undertaken to promote His glory. Here again we can subdivide according as this zeal for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> manifests itself in works of devotedness directed towards the fulfillment of the first or the second of the two great Commandments. In the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/psa063.htm#vrs10">Psalm 63:10</a>; <a href="../bible/num025.htm#vrs11">Numbers 25:11</a>; <a href="../bible/tit002.htm#vrs14">Titus 2:14</a>, etc.) it is mostly used in the first of these applications; in the phrase "zeal for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>" it is used in the second, and in this sense it is much the more common among religious writers.

<p>Zeal, being <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in action, just on that account tends to remove as far as lies in its power all that is injurious or hostile to the object of its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; it has thus its antipathies as well as its attractions. Moreover, since, though itself appertaining to the will, it presupposes an exercise of judgment as to the appropriate means for the attainment of its object, we must further distinguish <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> zeal, according as the judgment guiding it is sound or unsound. Thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> zeal was zeal throughout, but it was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> zeal in the days when he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> zeal when he became its Apostle. "Caritas Christi urget nos" are the words with which this Apostle described the promptings within his own breast of this zeal which contributed so powerfully to lay the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And it is a zeal of like nature which, enkindled in the breasts of so many generations of ardent followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has, in its co-operation with the lavish gifts of the Holy Spirit, built that Church up into the greatest marvel of human history. For it is the zeal of all those devout <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which, as distinguished from the lukewarmness of the ordinary <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, has sent forth the Apostles and missionaries to their lives of self-sacrifice, has filled the sanctuaries with an unfailing supply of good <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> with throngs of fervent religious, which has organized, sustained, and developed so splendid an array of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> to meet almost every conceivable need of suffering humanity.
