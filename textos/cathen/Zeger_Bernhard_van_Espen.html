<h1>Zeger Bernhard van Espen</h1>  

<p>(also called ESPENIUS)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> canonist, born at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 9 July, 1646; died at Amersfoort, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, 2 Oct., 1728. He completed his higher studies at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1673, and doctor of civil and canon law in 1675. He soon began to teach canon law at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> where he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to lecture only for six weeks during the summer vacation; the professor might explain one or other important chapter of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>, at his choice. He never accepted any other chair at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and he resigned even this position in order to devote himself entirely to study. He was consulted by all classes on account of his profound learning in canon law, and his famous work, "Jus canonicum universum", although it raised numerous just criticisms, still remains remarkable. The author is accused, not without reason, of having borrowed considerably from the works of his predecessors, notably from <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, yet it must be recognized that Van Espen possessed the art of setting forth in a lucid and intelligible way the discipline of the ancient Church; he also cast light upon questions which up to his time had been very obscure. His clear and concise style gives to his work a value which the labours of his predecessors do not possess. He collected the most recent legislative decisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and discussed them with judgment, except where party spirit blinded him. He had also the incontestable merit of showing with precision the special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> recognized his authority in this matter. On the other hand he was a strenuous defender of the Gallican theories. He misconstrued the right of religious authority and exaggerated beyond measure the right of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. It may be added, however, that he exalted and combated in turn all power, even the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. He exalted the power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in order to lessen that of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of an extinct chapter in order to combat the powers of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He gained for himself unpleasant <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> conflicts, by denying the importance of the famous distinction between right and fact with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Jansen; he declared that it was of little consequence to admit that Jansen had taught the propositions condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> (1713) provided the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> itself was rejected.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> quarrels led to Van Espen's ruin. On being consulted by the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Cornelius Steenoven, he pronounced in favour of this <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, which had been performed without the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. An unsuccessful attempt has been made to justify Van Espen's conduct in this matter, on the ground that he merely declared that episcopal <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> performed by a single <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was valid. This was not the whole question, nor was it indeed the principal question, viz. to determine whether an episcopal <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, performed without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent, was admissible. His action in this matter and his <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> doctrines brought about his suspension <em>a divinis</em> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. The latter summoned him to make a declaration of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. At the order of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> condemned and deprived (1728) Van Espen of his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> functions. In the meantime he fled, and took refuge first at Maastricht, and afterwards at Amersfoort, where he found protection in the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> community, and where he died. The Augustinian D&eacute;sirant, professor at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, is accused of having fabricated <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> documents in the controversy with Van Espen. This struggle is known as the "Forgery of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>". D&eacute;sirant was condemned by the academical authorities and banished forever from his native country. The best edition of the works of Van Espen, all of which are on the Index, is that published in four volumes at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 1753. A fifth volume, "Supplementum ad varias collectiones operum", was published at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1768, and contains numerous biographical details.
