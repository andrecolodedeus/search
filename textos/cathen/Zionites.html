<h1>Zionites</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visionary</a> fanatics which flourished in the eighteenth century at Ronsdorf in the Duchy of Berg, now part of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of the Rhine. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> sprang from a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Philadelphian <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> founded at Elberfeld in 1726 by Elias Eller and the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> Daniel Schleiermacher. Eller was the foreman of a factory owned by a rich <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. He read eagerly the writings of ancient and modern visionaries, and then formed an apocalyptic, millenarian system of his own. He made such an impression on the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, twenty years his senior, that she married him. Thus he obtained the means and influence to draw adherents around himself. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> Schleiermacher, grandfather of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, was also duped by Eller. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was the daughter of a baker, Anna van Bushel, who had dreams and visions and saw apparitions. After the death of his wife, Eller married her. She called herself mother of Zion, her husband father of Zion, and prophesied that she would bear the saviour of the world. The new order of things was to begin in 1730. Her first child was a daughter, but Eller was able to console the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> with Scriptural texts. A son born in 1733 died two years later. Eller made himself the central point of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality was replaced by the craving for coarse and sensual pleasures. In 1737 the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> left Elberfeld and founded Ronsdorf which soon prospered, and, through Eller's influence, was raised by the State in 1745 to the rank of a city. Eller took the most important offices for himself, lived with his wife in great pomp, and governed tyrannically. When Eller's wife died suddenly in 1744 <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> arose in the mind of Schleiermacher, who was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Ronsdorf. He confessed his mistake, and sought to open the eyes of the deceiving leader, but Eller managed to maintain himself until death. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was carried on by the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> who took Schleiermacher's place, by Eller's stepson Bolckhaus, and continued to exist until 1768. The new <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> chosen in this year and his successors brought back the inhabitants of Ronsdorf to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The after effects of the movement could be traced into the nineteenth century.
