<h1>Zu&ntilde;i Indians</h1>  

<p>A Pueblo tribe residing at Zu&ntilde;i on the bank of the Rio Zu&ntilde;i near the boundary of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, and in the adjoining villages of Nutria, Ojo Caliente, and Pescado. The name Zu&ntilde;i is a Spanish corruption of the Keresan <em>Sunifisti</em>, and was first used by Antonio de Espajo in 1583; the natives however called themselves Ashiwi (from <em>Shiwi</em>, flesh) and their territory Shiwona. They were discovered by Fray Marcos de Niza, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionary in 1539. Fray Marcos accompanied by a <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> Estavanico and some Indian guides had set out in that year to prepare the way for his fellow missionaries in unexplored regions. Estavanico had been sent forward to inspect the unknown lands; when Fray Marcos arrived in Arizona after passing through Sonora he learned that Estavanico had been killed. Nevertheless, he continued his journey and got sight of Hawikuh, one of the seven Zu&ntilde;i villages or pueblos. Owing to the hostility of the inhabitants, he was forced to return to Mexico, where he published an account of his journey, relating what he had heard of the Kingdom of Civola. This glowing description of the region led to the expedition of <a href="../cathen/04379e.htm">de Coronado</a> in 1540, the little army being accompanied by <a href="../cathen/11385a.htm">Fray Juan de Padilla</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/04379e.htm">Coronado</a>, after storming Hawikuh, discovered that Fray Marcos had been misled by the reports of the Indians, and that C&iacute;vola's rich cities were only seven ordinary Indian <em>pueblos</em>, none containing over 500 houses. In 1598 Fray Andres Corchado was sent to preach to the Zu&ntilde;i and the neighbouring tribes. This first permanent mission among the former was begun at Hawikuh in 1629 by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. On 22 February, 1632, Fray Francisco Letrado, and, five days later, Fray Martin de Arvide were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the Zu&ntilde;. When the <a href="../cathen/01592a.htm">Apache</a> attacked Hawikuh on 7 August, 1670, and destroyed the Zu&ntilde;i church, another <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Fray Padro de Avila y Ayala, gained a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown. In 1680 the Zu&ntilde;i joined in the Pueblo rising, killed their missionary, and fled, as they usually did when stricken with fear, to their fortress of Taaiyalone. The mission was continued until the nineteenth century, when it decayed from a want of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and resources.

<p>Recently, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Government, the Zu&ntilde;, who now number about 1640 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, are becoming civilized, and are learning to speak English. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries are again working among them. Of the twenty-two Zu&ntilde;i pueblos mentioned in historical times only Nutria, Ojo Caliente, Pescado, and Zu&ntilde;i are still in existence. The Zu&ntilde;i were the first of the Pueblo tribes met by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, and have changed but little in character since that time. They were in general peaceful unless much provoked, tenacious of their traditional practices and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and serious, yet at times very witty. Their features are clear cut, noses aquiline, and lips thin; contrary to most of the Pueblo tribes very many of them are long-headed. Albinos, with light golden hair and pink-gray or blue eyes, are not unfrequently met among them.

<p>The term Pueblo Indians (so called form the Spanish <em>pueblo</em>, a village) was applied to denote those <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> living permanently in groups of adobe or stone houses in <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a>, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, and the adjoining part of Mexico, and in prehistoric times in <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> and <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>. It now includes 5 tribes of Keresan, 6 of Shoshonean, 15 of Tanoan stock, and the Zu&ntilde;. The first great exploration of the Pueblo country was by <a href="../cathen/04379e.htm">de Coronado</a> in 1540-2. In 1581 Francisco S&aacute;nchez* Chamuscado and three <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Augustin Rodr&iacute;guez, Francisco Lopez, and Juan de Santa Maria, were slain by the Tigua Indians near the Rio Grande. Seventeen years later Juan de Onate visited this region, and, dividing it up into districts, had each district entrusted to the care of a missionary, thus definitively bringing the Pueblo into contact with civilization; but the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> available retarded the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian truth</a>. In 1630, in answer to an appeal, thirty more Franciscans came to the mission and worked with great success, until August, 1680, when disputes having arisen between the civil and <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, the Indians broke into rebellion, destroyed the missions and the religious archives, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> twenty-one of the thirty-three <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> as well as several hundred colonists. Again in 1696 an insurrection occurred and some more of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> lost their lives, but since then the Indians have in general remained tranquil, though in 1847 Governor Bent was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the Taos, incited by Mexicans; on the other hand the Zu&ntilde;i in particular have been very friendly and faithful to the Americans, supporting them in the Mexican War.

<p>In the northern part of the Pueblo region the village dwellings were generally constructed of sandstone or lava blocks; in the southern most of the houses were of adobe. The houses were generally several stories high, with ladders or steps on the outside, the roof of one story serving as a kind of veranda for the story above. The ground floor, evidently for reasons of defence, had no door, entrance being made by means of movable ladders. The houses were owned and built by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the men supplying the materials. The pottery and weaving of the Pueblo Indians are the finest in the present territory of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; while the basket work of the Hopi in particular is highly esteemed. The northern Pueblo were adept agriculturists, and made use of a system of irrigation. Corn and cotton were extensively grown. At present, beans, chile, melons, and pumpkins are carefully cultivated. Fish is never eaten, and there are few domesticated animals except the turkey and dog. The Pueblo men usually wore a jacket and trousers of deerskin, though now they use woollens; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> wear a cotton shirt and a woollen blanket passing over the right and under the left shoulder, and caught at the waist with a long coloured sash.

<p>Each tribe is formed of a certain number of clans, descent being through the maternal line; formerly the clan was presided over by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The Zu&ntilde;i had many <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> dealing with agriculture, magic, religion, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, etc. These <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> could be entered only after severe ordeals had been successfully borne. As part of an initiation <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> among this tribe chosen men clad only in the breech-cloth had to walk to a lake forty-five miles distant, under the blazing sun, to deposit a plume-stick and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for rain; while one of the trials to be undergone by a candidate for admission to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the Bow, was to sit unclad for hours on a large ant-hill. The rituals of the Pueblo contain many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; thus the Zu&ntilde;i have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for food, health, and rain. Prayer-sticks, that is sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings to the spirits, were largely used by the Pueblo. These sticks are usually made of cottonwood about seven inches long, and vary in shape, colour, and the feather attached, according to the nature of the petitions, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>. The stick is intended to represent the god to whom the feathers convey the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that are breathed into the spirit of the plumes. The Hopi had a special prayer-stick to which a small bag of sacred meal was attached. Green and blue prayer-sticks are often found in the Pueblo graves and especially in the ceremonial graves of <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a>. Polygamy among the Indians is unknown; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the more important element in married life; she has the power to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> the husband for trifling reasons, and he then returns to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> home, the children, if any, belonging to the mother. In former times the government was in the hands of the Indian priests; since the Spanish conquest, however, purely civil affairs are controlled by an elected body. The population of the Pueblo has remained practically stationary for the last hundred years, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> containing about 8400 inhabitants in the year 1887.
