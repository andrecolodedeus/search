<h1>&AElig;terni Patris</h1>  

<p>An encyclical letter of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> (issued 4 August, 1879); not to be confused with the <a href="../cathen/01176a.htm">apostolic letter of the same name</a> written by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>.

<p>Its purpose was the revival of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>, according to the mind of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. It opens with the consideration that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although officially the teacher of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> only, has always been interested in the cultivation of every branch of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, especially of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> on which the right cultivation of other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> in great measure depends. But the Pope declares that the actual condition of thought makes it a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for him to do something for the study of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> philosophy; because many present evils are to be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> philosophy, inasmuch as, since man is naturally led by reason, whither the reason leads the will easily follows. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> then shows how rational philosophy prepares the motives of credibility in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and explains and vindicates <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> unfolded by reason cannot contradict the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; hence, although in the pursuit of natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> may justly use its own method, principles, and arguments, yet not so as to withdraw from the authority of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> next shows, by extracts from many <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, what reason helped by revelation can do for the progress of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Then came the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, who brought together and bound into one harmonious whole, by a system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>. Since it was the work of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, to unite divine and human <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> could never have succeeded, as it did succeed, if their philosophy had not been a complete system.

<p><a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> then marks out <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> as the prince of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, for which he finds evidence in the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, and even of those outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, one of whom boasted that if the works of St. Thomas were taken away he would fight and defeat the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. That accounts for the unrelenting <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which has been made against <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> arose. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> points out how some have turned away from it, but passes on to show how it can help in the pursuit of metaphysical and social <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. It also insists that St. Thomas constantly founded his reasons and arguments on experiments; in the course of the centuries which have passed since his time, experiments have, of course, been disclosing facts and secrets of nature; nevertheless the writings of St. Thomas bear witness that the experimental spirit was as strong in him as it is in us. Hence, in the Pope's appeal to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> to, help in restoring and spreading the "wisdom" (<em>sapientiam</em>) of St. Thomas, he repeats, <em>Sapientiam Sancti Thomae dicimus</em>, because, as he explains, he does not at all ask to have the excessive subtleties of some scholastics revived, nor opinions which later investigations have exploded. The purpose of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> was the revival of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">St. Thomas's philosophy</a> and the continuing of his spirit of investigation, but not necessarily the adoption of every argument and opinion to be found in the works of the scholastics. It is worthy of remark that <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, following up the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, addressed (15 October, 1879) a letter to Cardinal de Luca in which, besides ordering that the philosophy of St. Thomas be taught in all the Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, he founded the "Accademia di San Tommaso", and made provision for a new edition of St. Thomas's works. The Accademia has done much to help on the movement thus inaugurated, and a Collegium of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers have ever since been working at the new (Leonine) edition of St. Thomas. A great part of the work has already been done, but all will not be completed for some years to come.
