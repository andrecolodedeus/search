<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> fought against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> fled from before the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and fell down wounded in mount Gelboe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> drew near pursuing after <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and his sons, and they killed <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and Abinadab, and Melchisua the sons of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the battle grew hard against <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and the archers reached him, and wounded him with arrows.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and mock me. But his armourbearer would not, for he was struck with fear: so <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> took his sword, and fell upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when his armourbearer saw it, to wit, that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> died, and his three sons, and all his house fell together.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the next day the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> taking away the spoils of them that were slain, found <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and his sons lying on mount Gelboe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when they had stripped him, and out off his head, and taken away his armour, they sent it into their land, to be carried about, and shown in the temples of the idols and to the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And his armour they <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of their god, and his head they fastened up in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jabes Galaad had heard this, to wit, all that the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had done to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> died for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, because he transgressed the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he had commanded, and kept it not: and moreover consulted also a witch,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And trusted not in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: therefore he slew him, and transferred his kingdom to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the son of Isai.</span></p>
