<div class="h1a">David is made king. He takes the castle of Zion. A catalogue of his valiant men.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> gathered themselves to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, saying: We are thy bone, and thy flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Yesterday also, and the day before when <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and thou shalt be ruler over them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> came to the king to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> made a covenant with them before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and they anointed him king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> which he spoke in the hand of Samuel.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thou shalt not come in here. But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took the castle of Sion, which is the city of David.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said: Whosoever shall first strike the Jebusites, shall be the head and chief <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>. And Joab the son of Sarvia went up first, and was made the general.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> dwelt in the castle, and therefore it was called the city of David,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he built the city round about from Mello all round, and Joab built the rest of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went on growing and increasing, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> was with him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> These are the chief of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, who helped him to be made king over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which he spoke to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And this is the number of the heroes of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Jesbaam the son of Hachamoni the chief among the thirty: he lifted up his spear against three hundred wounded by him at one time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And after him was <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> his uncle's son the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He was with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in Phesdomim, when the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were gathered to that place to battle: and the field of that country was full of barley, and the people fled from before the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> stood in the midst of the field, and defended it: and they slew the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave a great deliverance to his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And three of the thirty <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> went down to the rock, wherein <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was, to the <a href="../cathen/01162a.htm">cave of Odollam</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> encamped in the valley of Raphaim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was in a hold, and the garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> longed, and said: O that some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would give me water of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cistern</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, which is in the gate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And these three broke through the midst of the camp of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and drew water out of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cistern</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, which was in the gate, and brought it to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to drink: and he would not drink of it, but rather offered it to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should do this in the sight of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and should drink the blood of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: for with the danger of their lives they have brought me the water. And therefore he would not drink. These things did the three most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai the brother of Joab</a>, he was chief of three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And illustrious among the second three, and their <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>: but yet he attained not to the first three.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias the son of Joiada</a> a most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of Cabseel, who had done many acts: he slew the two ariels of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: and he went down, and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow. <span class="stiki"><strong>Two ariels...</strong> That is, two lions, or lion-like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; for <em>Ariel</em> in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> signifies a lion.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he slew an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, whose stature was of five cubits, and who had a spear like a weaver's beam: and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked away the spear, that he held in his hand, and slew him with his own spear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> These things did <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias the son of Joiada</a>, who was renowned among the three <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> ones,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the first among the thirty, but yet to the three he attained not: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> made him of his council.</span></p>
