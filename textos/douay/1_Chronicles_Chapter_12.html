<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now these are they that came to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to Siceleg, while he yet fled from <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> the son of Cis, and they were most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> and excellent warriors,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Bending the bow, and using either hand in hurling stones with slings, and shooting arrows: of the brethren of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul of Benjamin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The chief was Ahiezer, and Joas, the sons of Samoa of Gabaath, and Jaziel, and Phallet the sons of Azmoth, and Beracha, and <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> an <a href="../cathen/01457a.htm">Anathothite</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Samaias of Gabaon, the stoutest amongst the thirty and over the thirty; <a href="../cathen/08333c.htm">Jeremiah</a>, and Jeheziel and Johanan, and Jozabad of Gaderoth;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Eluzai, and Jerimuth, and Baalia, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and Saphatia the Haruphite;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Elcana, and Jesia, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jesbaam of Carehim:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Joela, and Zabadia the sons of Jeroham of <a href="../cathen/06332a.htm">Gedor</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> From Gaddi also there went over to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, when he lay hid in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and excellent warriors, holding shield and spear: whose faces were like the faces of a lion, and they were swift like the roebucks on the mountains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Ezer the chief, Obdias the second, Eliab the third,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Masmana the fourth, <a href="../cathen/08333c.htm">Jeremiah</a> the fifth,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> These were of the <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">sons of Gad</a>, <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army: the least of them was <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> over a hundred soldiers, and the greatest over a thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> These are they who passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> in the first month, when it is used to flow over its banks: and they put to flight all that dwelt in the valleys both toward the east and toward the west.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And there came also of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> to the hold, in which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> abode.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went out to meet them, and said: If you are come peaceably to me to help me, let my heart be joined to you: but if you plot against me for my enemies whereas I have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> in my hands, let the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers see, and judge.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But the spirit came upon Amasai the chief among thirty, and he said: We are thine, O <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and for thee, O son of Isai: peace, peace be to thee, and peace to thy helpers. For thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> helpeth thee. So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> received them, and made them <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the band.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And there were some of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> that went over to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, when he came with the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> against <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> to fight: but he did not fight with them: because the lords of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> taking counsel sent him back, saying: With the danger of our heads he will return to his master <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So when he went back to Siceleg, there fled to him of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, Ednas and Jozabad, and Jedihel, and Michael, and Ednas, and Jozabad, and Eliu, and Salathi, <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of thousands in <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> These helped <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> against the rovers: for they were all most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and were made commanders in the army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Moreover day by day there came some to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to help him till they became a great number, like the army of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And this is the number of the chiefs of the army who came to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, when he was in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, to transfer to him the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
