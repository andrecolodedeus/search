<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> He made also houses for himself in the city of David: and built a place for the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>, and pitched a <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> for it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: No one ought to carry the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath chosen to carry it, and to minister unto himself for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he gathered all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> together into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> might be brought into its place, which he had prepared for it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> also, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Of the children of Caath, Uriel was the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Lest as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> at first struck us, because you were not present, the same should now also come to pass, by our doing some thing against the law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>, to carry the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a> took the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had commanded, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, upon their shoulders, with the staves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> spoke to the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, to appoint some of their brethren to be singers with musical instruments, to wit, on psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, that the joyful noise might resound on high.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they appointed <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, Hemam the son of Joel, and of his brethren Asaph the son of Barachias: and of the sons of Merari, their brethren: Ethan the son of Casaia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And with them their brethren: in the second rank, Zacharias, and Ben, and Jaziel, and Semiramoth, and Jahiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a>, and Maasias, and <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a>, and Eliphalu, and Macenias, and Obededom, and Jehiel, the porters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, sounded with cymbals of brass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and Maasias, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a>, sung mysteries upon psalteries.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a>, and Eliphalu, and Macenias and Obededom, and Jehiel and Ozaziu, sung a song of victory for the octave upon harps.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Chonenias chief of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, presided over the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a>, to give out the tunes: for he was very skilful. <span class="stiki"><strong>The prophecy, to give out the tunes...</strong> Singing praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is here called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a>: the more, because these singers were often <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Barachias, and Elcana, were doorkeepers of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Sebenias, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharias, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a>, and Eliezer the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, sounded with trumpets, before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>: and Obededom and Jehias were porters of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> over thousands, went to bring the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> out of the house of Obededom with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had helped the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> who carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>, they offered in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> seven oxen, and seven rams.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> that carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, and the singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and Chonenias the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> among the singers: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> also had on him an <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> of linen.</span>
