<div class="h1a">David's purpose to build a temple is rewarded by most ample promises. David's thanksgiving.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was dwelling in his house, he said to <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan the prophet</a>: Behold I dwell in a house of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> is under skins.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Do all that is in thy heart: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now that night the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came to <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Go, and speak to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my servant: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and in a tent,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Abiding with all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I have given a place my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> waste them, as at the beginning,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Since the days that I gave judges to my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will build thee a house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> speak to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> came and sat before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: Who am I, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and hast made me remarkable above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> What can <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> add more, seeing thou hast thus <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> thy servant, and known him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shown all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> there is none like thee: and here is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And thou hast made thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, art become their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now therefore, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And let thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his servant remaineth before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> before thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And now O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thou art <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and thou hast <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to thy servant such great benefits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And thou hast begun to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessest</a> it, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, it shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> for ever.</span></p>
