<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> defeated the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> them, and took away Geth, and her daughters out of the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he defeated <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> were made <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> servants, and brought him gifts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> defeated also Adarezer king of Soba of the land of Hemath, when he went to extend his dominions as far as the river Euphrates.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and he houghed all the chariot horses, only a hundred chariots, which he reserved for himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> came also to help Adarezer king of Soba: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slew of them likewise two and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he put a garrison in <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, that <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> also should serve him, and bring gifts. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> assisted him in all things to which he went.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took the golden quivers which the servants of Adarezer had, and he brought them to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer, he brought very much brass, of which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He sent Adoram his son to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> to desire peace of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown Adarezer: for Thou was an enemy to Adarezer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And all the vessels of gold, and silver and brass <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, with the silver and gold which he had taken from all the nations, as well from <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">sons of Ammon</a>, as from the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai the son of Sarvia</a> slew of the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a> in the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he put a garrison in <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> should serve <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> preserved <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in all things to which he went.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> reigned over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and executed judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> among all his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army, and Josaphat the son of Ahilud recorder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, were the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: and Susa, scribe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias the son of Joiada</a> was over the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi: and the sons of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> were chief about the king.</span></p>
