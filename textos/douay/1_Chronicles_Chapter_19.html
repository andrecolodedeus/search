<div class="h1a">The Ammonites abuse David's ambassadors: both they and their confederates are overthrown.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now it came to pass that Naas the king of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> died, and his son reigned in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: I will show kindness to Hanon the son of Naas: for his father did a favour tome. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father. But when they were come into the land of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, to comfort Hanon,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The princes of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> said to Hanon: Thou thinkest perhaps that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to do honour to thy father hath sent comforters to thee: and thou dost not take notice, that his servants are come to thee to consider, and search, and spy out thy land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beards</a> of the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and cut away their garments from the buttocks to the feet, and sent them away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when they were gone, they sent word to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, who sent to meet them (for they had suffered a great affront) and ordered them to stay at <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> till their <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beards</a> grew and then to return.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> saw that they had done an injury to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, Hanon and the rest of the people sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia and out of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> Maacha, and out of Soba.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha, with his people. And they came and camped over against Medaba. And the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> gathered themselves together out of their cities, and came to battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> came out and put their army in array before the gate of the city: and the kings, that were come to their aid, stood apart in the field.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Wherefore Joab understanding that the battle was set against him before and behind, chose out the bravest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and marched against the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a> his brother, and they went against the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said: If the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> be too strong for thee, I will help thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and let us behave ourselves manfully for our people, and for the cities of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in his sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So Joab and the people that were with him, went against the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> to the battle: and he put them to flight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> seeing that the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> were fled, they likewise fled from <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a> his brother, and went into the city: and Joab also returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> seeing that they had fallen before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, sent messengers, and brought to them the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> that were beyond the river: and Sophach, general of the army of Adarezer, was their leader.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and he gathered together all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and passed the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and came upon them, and put his army in array against them, and they fought with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> fled before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slew of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and Sophach the general of the army. <span class="stiki"><strong>Seven thousand chariots...</strong> That is, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who fought in chariots.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when the servants of Adarezer saw themselves overcome by <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, they went over to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and served him: and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> would not help the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> any more.</span></p>
