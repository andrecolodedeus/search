<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass after the course of a year, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab gathered together an army and the strength of the troops, and wasted the land of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>: and went and besieged Rabba. But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> stayed at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">most precious stones</a>, and he made himself a diadem of it: he took also the spoils of the city which were very great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the people that were therein he brought out: and made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they were cut and bruised to pieces: in this manner <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> dealt with all the cities of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>: and he returned with all his people to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> After this there arose a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> at Gazer against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Another battle also was fought against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, in which Adeodatus the son of Saltus a <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehemite</a> slew the brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> There was another battle also in Geth, in which there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand and foot: who also was born of the stock of Rapha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">reviled</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: but <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of Samaa the brother of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slew him. These were the sons of Rapha in Geth, who fell by the hand of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his servants.</span></p>
