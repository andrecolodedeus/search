<div class="h1a">David's sin in numbering the people is punished by a pestilence: which ceases upon his offering sacrifice in the threshing floor of Ornan.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> rose up against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and moved <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to number <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people: Go, and number <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a> even to <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, and bring me the number of them that I may know it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Joab answered: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> make his people a hundred times more than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the king's word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went through all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he gave <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the number of them, whom he had surveyed: and all the number of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was found to be eleven hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that drew the sword: and of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> four hundred and seventy thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The number, etc...</strong> The difference of the numbers here and <a href="../douay/2sa024.htm">2 Samuel 24</a> is to be accounted for, by supposing the greater number to be that which was really found, and the lesser to be that which Joab gave in.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a> and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> he did not number: for Joab unwillingly executed the king's orders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was displeased with this thing that was commanded: and he struck <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> exceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of thy servant, for I have done foolishly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a> the seer of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Go, and speak to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and tell him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one which thou wilt, and I will do it to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a> was come to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, he said to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: choose which thou wilt:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Either three years famine: or three months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or three days to have the sword of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and pestilence in the land, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> destroying in all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Three years famine...</strong> Which joined with the three foregoing years of famine mentioned, <a href="../douay/2sa021.htm">2 Samuel 21</a> and the seventh year of the land's resting, would make up the seven years proposed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <a href="../douay/2sa024.htm#verse13">2 Samuel 24:13</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a>: I am on every side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent a pestilence upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And there fell of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> seventy thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he sent an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> stood by the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. <span class="stiki"><strong>Ornan...</strong> Otherwise Areuna.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> lifting up his eyes, saw the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> standing between <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: it is I that have done the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a> to tell <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, to go up, and build an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went up, according to the word of <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a>, which he spoke to him in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Ornan said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>: I will give it all willingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much as it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> free cost.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sicles of gold of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> weight. <span class="stiki"><strong>Six hundred sicles, etc...</strong> This was the price of the whole place, on which the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was afterwards built; but the price of the oxen was fifty sicles of silver. <a href="../douay/2sa024.htm#verse24">2 Samuel 24:24</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he built there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and he offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, and he called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he heard him by sending fire from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: and he put up his sword again into the sheath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> seeing that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> made in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ia">altar of holocausts</a>, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> could not go to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> there to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a>.</span></p>
