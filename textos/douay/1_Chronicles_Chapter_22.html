<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: This is the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">house of God</a>, And this is the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he commanded to gather together all the <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a> of the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and out of them he appointed stonecutters to hew stones and polish them, to build the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> prepared in abundance iron for the nails of the gates, and for the closures and joinings: and of brass an immense weight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar trees</a> were without number, which the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyrians</a> brought to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> my son is very young and tender, and the house which I would have to be built to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, must be such as to be renowned in all countries: therefore I will prepare him necessaries. And therefore before his death he prepared all the charges.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he called for <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> his son: and commanded him to build a house to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: My son, it was my desire to have built a house to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying: Thou hast shed much blood, and fought many battles, so thou cannot not build house to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, after shedding so much blood before me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The son, that shall be born to thee, shall be a most quiet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for I will make him rest from all his enemies round about: and therefore he shall be called Peaceable: and I will give peace and quietness to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> all his days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He shall build a house to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him: and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now then, my son, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be with thee, and do thou prosper, and build the house to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, as he hath spoken of thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also give thee wisdom and understanding, that thou mayest be able to rule <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and to keep the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For then thou shalt be able to prosper, if thou keep the commandments, and judgments, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to teach <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and act manfully, fear not, nor be dismayed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Behold I in my <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty</a> have prepared the charges of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, of gold a hundred thousand talents, and of silver a million of talents: but of brass, and of iron there is no weight, for the abundance surpasseth all account: timber also and stones I have prepared for all the charges.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thou hast also workmen in abundance, hewers of stones, and masons, and carpenters, and of all trades the most skilful in their work,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> In gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, whereof there is no number. Arise then, and be doing, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will be with thee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> also charged all the princes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to help <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> his son,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Give therefore your hearts and your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to seek the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> and arise, and build a sanctuary to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>, and the vessels <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, may be brought into the house, which is built to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
