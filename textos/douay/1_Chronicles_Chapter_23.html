<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he gathered together all the princes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> were numbered from the age of thirty years, and upwards: and there were found of them thirty-eight thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Of these twenty-four thousand were chosen, and distributed unto the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and six thousand were the overseers and judges.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Moreover four thousand were porters: and as many singers singing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with the instruments, which he had made to sing with.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> distributed them into courses by the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a>, to wit, of Gerson, and of Caath, and of Merari.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the sons of Semei were Leheth, and Ziza, and Jaus, and Baria: these were the sons of Semei, four.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Leheth was the first, Ziza the second: but Jaus and Baria had not many children, and therefore they were counted in one <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and in one house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The sons of Caath were Amram, and Isaar, <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, and Oziel, four.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The sons of Musi: Moholi, and Eder, and Jerimoth, three.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> These are the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a> in their kindreds and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, princes by their courses, and the number of every head that did the works of the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> from twenty years old and upward.</span>
