<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And to Semei his son were born sons, heads of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>: for they were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of great valour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The sons then of Semeias were Othni, and Raphael, and Obed, Elizabad, and his brethren most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and Eliu, and Samachias.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Among these were the divisions of the porters, so that the chiefs of the wards, as well as their brethren, always ministered in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they cast lots equally, both little and great, by their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> for every one of the gates.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the lot of the east fell to Selemias. But to his son Zacharias, a very wise and learned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the north gate fell by lot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And to Obededom and his sons that towards the south: in which part of the house was the council of the ancients.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Subael the son of Gersom, the son of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was chief over the treasures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> His brethren also, Eliezer, whose son Rohobia, and his son Isaias, and his son Joram, and his son Zechri, and his son Selemith.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And all these things that Samuel the seer and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> the son of Cis, and <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Sarvia had <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>: and whosoever had <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> those things, they were under the hand of Selemith and his brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But Chonenias and his sons were over the Isaarites, for the business abroad over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to teach them and judge them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And of the <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebronites</a> Hasabias, and his brethren most able <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, a thousand seven hundred had the charge over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> westward, in all the works of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and for the service of the king.</span>
