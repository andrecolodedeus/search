<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And for the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ib">altar of incense</a>, he gave the purest gold: and to make the likeness of the chariot of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> spreading their wings, and covering the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> All these things, said he, came to me written by the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that I might understand all the works of the pattern.</span></p>
