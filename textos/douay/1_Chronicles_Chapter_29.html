<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> said to all the assembly: <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> my son, whom alone <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath chosen, is as yet young and tender: and the work is great, for a house is prepared not for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I with all my ability have prepared the expenses for the house of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Gold for vessels of gold, and silver for vessels of silver, brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood: and onyx stones, and stones like alabaster, and of divers colours, and all manner of <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>, and marble of Paros in great abundance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now over and above the things which I have offered into the house of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I give of my own proper goods, gold and silver for the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of my God</a>, beside what things I have prepared for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Three thousand talents of gold of the gold of <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a>: and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And gold for wheresoever there is need of gold: and silver for wheresoever there is need of silver, for the works to be made by the hands of the artificers: now if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is willing to offer, let him fill his hand to day, and offer what he pleaseth to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then the heads of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and the princes of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of thousands, and of <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">hundreds</a>, and the overseers of the king's <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a> promised,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> before all the multitude, and he said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> art thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, our father from eternity to eternity.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Thine are riches, and thine is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, thou hast dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now therefore our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we give thanks to thee, and we praise thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to promise thee all these things? all things are thine: and we have given thee what we received of thy hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For we are sojourners before thee, and strangers, as were all our fathers. I Our days upon earth are as a shadow, and there is no stay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, is from thy hand, and all things are thine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I know my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that thou provest hearts, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> simplicity, wherefore I also in the simplicity of my heart, have joyfully offered all these things: and I have seen with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> thy people, which are here present, offer thee their <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> our fathers, keep for ever this will of their heart, and let this mind remain always for the worship of thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And give to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> my son a perfect heart, that he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and do all things: and build the house, for which I have provided the charges.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> commanded all the assembly: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Bless</a> ye the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> victims to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and they offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> the next day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every thing prescribed most abundantly for all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they ate, and drank before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that day with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And they anointed the second time <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. And they anointed him to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to be prince, and Sadoc to be <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> sat on the throne of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> as king instead of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father, and he pleased all: and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And all the princes, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of power, and all the sons of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> gave their hand, and were subject to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> magnified <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and gave him the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a reign, such as no king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the son of Isai reigned over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the days that he reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, were forty years: in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> he reigned seven years, and in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> three and thirty years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Now the acts of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> first and last are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan the prophet</a>, and in the book of <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad the seer</a>:</span>
