<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Be ye followers of me, as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me and keep my <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">ordinances</a> as I have delivered them to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the head of every man is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: and the head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the man: and the head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a> with his head covered disgraceth his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But every <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a> with her head not covered disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The man indeed ought not to cover his head: because he is the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the man.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For the man is not of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the man.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For the man was not created for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for the man.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore ought the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to have a power over her head, because of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>A power...</strong> that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband: and this, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> adds, because of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are present in the assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But yet neither is the man without the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without the man, in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is of the man, so also is the man by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: but all things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> You yourselves judge. Doth it become a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> uncovered?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Doth not even <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself teach you that a man indeed, if he nourish his <a href="../cathen/07113a.htm">hair</a>, it is a shame unto him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> nourish her <a href="../cathen/07113a.htm">hair</a>, it is a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to her; for her <a href="../cathen/07113a.htm">hair</a> is given to her for a covering.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now this I <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">ordain</a>: not praising you, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For first of all I hear that when you come together in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, there are <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> among you. And in part I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For there must be also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>: that they also, who are approved may be made manifest among you. <span class="stiki"><strong>There must be also heresies...</strong> By reason of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and perversity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart; not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> or appointment; who nevertheless draws <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> out of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and firm <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and making their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> more remarkable.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Lord's supper</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Lord's supper...</strong> So the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> here calls the <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">charity feasts</a> observed by the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and reprehends the abuses of the <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinthians</a>, on these occasions; which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">eucharistic sacrifice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">sacrament</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> What, have you no houses to eat and to drink in? Or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> ye the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For I have received of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> that which also I delivered unto you, that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">same night</a> in which he was betrayed, took <a href="../cathen/02749a.htm">bread</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye and eat: This is my <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">body</a>, which shall be delivered for you. This do for the commemoration of me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> In like manner also the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, after he had supped, saying: This <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is the new testament in my blood. This do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For as often as you shall eat this <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">bread</a> and drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, you shall show the death of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, until he come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Therefore, whosoever shall eat this <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">bread</a>, or drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> unworthily, shall be guilty of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">body and of the blood of the Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Or drink...</strong> Here <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> translators corrupted the text, by putting <em>and drink</em> (contrary to the original) instead of <em>or drink</em>. <strong>Guilty of the body, etc., not discerning the body, etc...</strong> This demonstrates the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">real presence of the body and blood of Christ</a>, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be guilty of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">body and blood of Christ</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned for not discerning the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Lord's body</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But let a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> himself: and so let him eat of that <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">bread</a> and drink of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Drink of the chalice...</strong> This is not said by way of <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">command</a>, but by way of allowance, viz., where and when it is agreeable to the practice and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For he that <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">eateth and drinketh</a> unworthily <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">eateth and drinketh</a> <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment</a> to himself, not discerning the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">body of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you: and many sleep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judged</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But whilst we are <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judged</a>, we are chastised by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that we be not condemned with this world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment</a>. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.</span></p>
