<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Follow after <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">spiritual gifts</a>; but rather that you may <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Prophesy...</strong> That is, declare or expound the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For he that <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speaketh in a tongue</a> speaketh not unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> heareth. Yet by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> he speaketh <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Not unto men...</strong> Viz., so as to be heard, that is, so as to be understood by them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But he that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesieth</a> speaketh to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto edification and exhortation and comfort.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He that <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speaketh in a tongue</a> edifieth himself: but he that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesieth</a>, edifieth the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I would have you all to <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speak with tongues</a>, but rather to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>. For greater is he that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesieth</a> than he that <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speaketh with tongues</a>: unless perhaps he interpret, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> may receive edification.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But now, brethren, if I come to you <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speaking with tongues</a>, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> or in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or in <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> or in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what is piped or harped?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what is said? For you shall be speaking into the air.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world: and none is without voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If then I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian: and he that speaketh a barbarian to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So you also, forasmuch as you are <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">spirits</a>, seek to abound unto the edifying of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of spirits...</strong> Of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">spiritual gifts</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And therefore he that <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speaketh by a tongue</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that he may interpret.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For if I <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">pray in a tongue</a>, my <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayeth</a>: but my understanding is without fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> What is it then? I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also with the understanding, I will sing with the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, I will sing also with the understanding.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Else, if thou shalt <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, to thy <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>? Because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not what thou sayest. <span class="stiki"><strong>Amen...</strong> The unlearned, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you are then <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, will not be qualified to join with you by saying <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> to your <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>. The use or abuse of <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">strange tongues</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> here speaks, does not regard the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">public liturgy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, (in which <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">strange tongues</a> were never used), but certain conferences of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> (<a href="../douay/1co014.htm#verse26">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>, etc.), in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their various <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">gifts of the Spirit</a>, common in those primitive times; amongst which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> prefers that of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesying</a> before that of <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speaking strange tongues</a>, because it was more to the public edification. Where also not, that the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, used in our <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, is so far from being a strange or unknown tongue, that it is perhaps the best known tongue in the world.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For thou indeed givest thanks well: but the other is not edified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> I thank my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I speak with all your <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">tongues</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also: than ten thousand words in a <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">tongue</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Brethren, do not become children in sense. But in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> be children: and in sense be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> In the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people: and neither so will they hear me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Wherefore <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">tongues</a> are for a sign, not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believers</a> but to unbelievers: but <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecies</a>, not to unbelievers but to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believers</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> If therefore the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> come together into one place, and all <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speak with tongues</a>, and there come in unlearned persons or <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a>, will they not say that you are <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">mad</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But if all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>, and there come in one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not or an unlearned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, he is convinced of all: he is judged of all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The secrets of his heart are made manifest. And so, falling down on his face, he will <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, affirming that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is among you indeed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> How is it then, brethren? When you come together, every one of you hath a <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psalm</a>, hath a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, hath a <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelation</a>, hath a <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">tongue</a>, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> If any <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speak with a tongue</a>, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course: and let one interpret.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> and speak to himself and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And let the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> speak, two or three: and let the rest judge.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But if any thing be <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For you may all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>, one by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are subject to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> keep silence in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>: for it is not permitted them to speak but to be subject, as also the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> saith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But if they would learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to speak in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Or did the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a> come out from you? Or came it only unto you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> If any seem to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or spiritual, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, he shall not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Wherefore, brethren, be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>: and forbid not to <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speak with tongues</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But let all things be done decently and according to order.</span></p>
