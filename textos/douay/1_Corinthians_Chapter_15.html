<div class="h1a">Christ's resurrection and ours. The manner of our resurrection.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now I make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you, brethren, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> By which also you are <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in vain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">died for our sins</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And that he was buried: and that he <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose again</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And that he was seen by <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>, and after that by the eleven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> After that, he was seen by <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>: then by all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For I am the least of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who am not worthy to be called an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, because I <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I am what I am. And his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in me hath not been void: but I have laboured more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For whether I or they, so we preach: and so you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be preached, that he <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">arose again from the dead</a>, how do some among you say that there is no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But if there be no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be not <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>, then is our preaching vain: and your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is also vain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Yea, and we are found <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: because we have given testimony against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he hath <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised up Christ</a>, whom he hath not <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised up</a>, if the dead <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise not again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For if the dead <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise not again</a>, neither is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be not <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>, your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is vain: for you are yet in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then they also that are fallen asleep in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are perished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> If in this life only we have <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we are of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most miserable.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen from the dead</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of them that sleep:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For by a <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">man</a> came death: and by a <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">man</a> the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, so also in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> all shall be made alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But every one in his own order: the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: then they that are of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">coming</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Afterwards the end: when he shall have delivered up the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God and the Father</a>: when he shall have brought to nought all principality and power and virtue.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the enemy, death, shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be all in all. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Son also himself shall be subject unto him...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> will be subject to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, according to his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, even after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a>; and also the whole <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">mystical body of Christ</a> will be entirely subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> him in every thing.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Otherwise, what shall they do that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the dead, if the dead <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise</a> not again at all? Why are they then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for them? <span class="stiki"><strong>That are baptized for the dead...</strong> Some think the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> here alludes to a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> then in use; but others, more probably, to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penitential</a> labours, performed by the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed; or to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of afflictions and sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Why also are we in danger every hour?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> I die daily, I protest by your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, brethren, which I have in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> If (according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>) I fought with beasts at <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, what doth it profit me, if the dead <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise</a> not again? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let us eat and drink, etc...</strong> That is, if we did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we were to <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again from the dead</a>, we might live like the impious and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who have no <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Be not seduced: <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Evil</a> communications corrupt <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> manners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Awake, ye <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not. For some have not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I speak it to your shame.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will say: How do the dead <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a>? Or with what manner of body shall they come?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Senseless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be: but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, another of beasts, other of birds, another of fishes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> One is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the sun, another the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the moon, and another the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the stars. For star differeth from star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> So also is the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>. It is sown in corruption: it shall <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise</a> in incorruption.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> It is sown in dishonour: it shall rise in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. It is sown in weakness: it shall <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise</a> in power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> It is sown a natural body: it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> The first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made into a <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">last Adam</a> into a quickening <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: afterwards that which is spiritual.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> The first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was of the earth, earthly: the second <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a>, such also are they that are <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> Behold, I tell you a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. We shall all indeed <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a>: but we shall not all be changed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a> incorruptible. And we shall be changed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And when this mortal hath put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Now the sting of death is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and the power of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> But thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hath given us the victory through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable: always abounding in the work of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that your labour is not in vain in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
