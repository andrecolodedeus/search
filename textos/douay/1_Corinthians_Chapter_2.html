<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For I judged not myself to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything among you, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: and him crucified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I was with you in weakness and in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and in much trembling.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom, but in showing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> and power:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> That your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might not stand on the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but on the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Howbeit we speak wisdom among the <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But we speak the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, a wisdom which is hidden, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordained before the world, unto our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Which none of the princes of this world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. For if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would never have crucified the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord of glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard: neither hath it entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But to us <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> them by his <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> searcheth all things, yea, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">deep things</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is in him? So the things also that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now, we have received not the spirit of this world, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are given us from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Which things also we speak: not in the learned words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom, but in the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But the sensual <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perceiveth not these things that are of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. For it is foolishness to him: and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined. <span class="stiki"><strong>The sensual man &mdash; the spiritual man...</strong> The sensual <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is either he who is taken up with sensual pleasures, with carnal and worldly affections; or he who measureth <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">divine mysteries</a> by <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">natural reason</a>, sense, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom only. Now such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has little or no notion of the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whereas the spiritual <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is he who, in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, takes not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense for his guide: but submits his judgment to the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, which he is commanded to hear and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hath <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to remain to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a> with his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, and to direct her in all things by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of truth</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the spiritual <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> judgeth all things: and he himself is judged of no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For who hath <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that he may instruct him? But we have the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></p>
