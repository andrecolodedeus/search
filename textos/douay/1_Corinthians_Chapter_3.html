<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I gave you milk to drink, not meat: for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able: for you are yet carnal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For, whereas there is among you <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envying</a> and contention, are you not carnal and walk you not according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For while one saith: I indeed am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: and another: I am of Apollo: are you not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? What then is Apollo and what is <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of him whom you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: and to every one as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I have planted, Apollo watered: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave the increase.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that giveth the increase.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now he that planteth and he that watereth, are one. And every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For we are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> coadjutors. You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> husbandry: you are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> building.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> According to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation: and another buildeth thereon.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For other foundation no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can lay, but that which is laid: which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now, if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> build upon this foundation, gold, silver, <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>, wood, hay, stubble: <span class="stiki"><strong>Upon this foundation...</strong> The foundation is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>: or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in him, working through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. The building upon this foundation gold, silver, and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>, signifies the more perfect preaching and practice of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>; the wood, hay, and stubble, such preaching as that of the <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinthian</a> teachers (who affected the pomp of words and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eloquence) and such practice as is mixed with much imperfection, and many lesser <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now the day of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and his fiery trial, (in the <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular judgment</a> immediately after death), shall make manifest of what sort every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work has been: of which, during this life, it is hard to make a judgment. For then the fire of <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">God's judgment</a> shall try every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work. And they, whose works, like wood, hay, and stubble, cannot abide the fire, shall suffer loss; these works being found to be of no value; yet they themselves, having built upon the right foundation, (by living and dying in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in the state of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, though with some imperfection), shall be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a> yet so as by fire; being liable to this punishment, by reason of the wood, hay, and stubble, which was mixed with their building.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work shall be manifest. For the day of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire. And the fire shall try every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work, of what sort it is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">reward</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, yet so as by fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that you are the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwelleth in you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> violate the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him shall <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> destroy.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deceive himself. If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And again: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> therefore <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For all things are yours, whether it be <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> or Apollo or <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>, or the world, or <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, or death, or things present, or things to come.
