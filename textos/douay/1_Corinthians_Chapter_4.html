<div class="h1a">God's ministers are not to be judged. He reprehends their boasting of their preachers and describes the treatment the apostles every where met with.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Let a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so account of us as of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the dispensers of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Here now it is required among the dispensers that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be found <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> day. But neither do I judge my own self.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For I am not conscious to myself of anything. Yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Therefore, judge not before the time: until the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have praise from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes: that in us you may learn that one be not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">puffed up</a> against the other for another, above that which is written.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For who distinguisheth thee? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received, and if thou hast received, why dost thou <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as if thou hadst not received it?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> You are now full: you are now become rich: you reign without us; and I would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For I think that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath set forth us <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the last, as it were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> appointed to death. We are made a spectacle to the world and to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> We are fools for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, but you are wise in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: we are weak, but you are strong: you are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, but we without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no fixed abode.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And we labour, working with our own hands. We are <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">reviled</a>: and we <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a>. We are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>: and we suffer it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> We are <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>: and we entreat. We are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all, even until now.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I write not these things to confound you: but I <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">admonish</a> you as my dearest children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For if you have ten thousand instructors in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet not many fathers. For in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, I have begotten you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For this cause have I sent to you <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Timothy</a>, who is my dearest son and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>: as I teach every where in every <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But I will come to you shortly, if the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will: and will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not in speech, but in power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> What will you? Shall I come to you with a rod? Or in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and in the spirit of meekness?</span></p>
