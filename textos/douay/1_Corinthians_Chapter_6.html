<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust: and not before the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge who are the most <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is able to judge between his brethren?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But brother goeth to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> with brother: and that before unbelievers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have law suits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">defrauded</a>? <span class="stiki"><strong>A fault...</strong> Lawsuits can hardly ever be without a fault, on the one side or the other; and oftentimes on both sides.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But you do wrong and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">defraud</a>: and that to your brethren.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that the unjust shall not possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> All things are lawful to me: but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me: but I will not be brought under the power of any. <span class="stiki"><strong>All things are lawful, etc...</strong> That is, all indifferent things are indeed lawful, inasmuch as they are not prohibited; but oftentimes they are not expedient; as in the case of lawsuits, etc. And much less would it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing, how indifferent soever.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Meat for the belly and the belly for the meats: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall destroy both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for the body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised up the Lord</a> and will <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">raise us up</a> also by his power.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But he who is joined to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is one spirit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Fly fornication. Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> doth is without the body: but he that committeth fornication <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> against his own body.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in your body.</span></p>
