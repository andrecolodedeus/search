<h1>1 Corinthians Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">Lessons relating to marriage and celibacy. Virginity is preferable to a married state.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now concerning the things whereof you <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">wrote</a> to me: It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife: and let every <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> have her own husband. <span class="stiki"><strong>Have his own wife...</strong> That is, keep to his wife, which he hath. His meaning is not to exhort the unmarried to <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>: on the contrary, he would have them rather continue as they are, (<a href="../douay/1co007.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 7:8</a>). But he speaks here to them that are already <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a>; who must not depart from one another, but live together as they ought to do in the <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> state.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Let the husband render the debt to his wife: and the wife also in like manner to the husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The wife hath not power of her own body: but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body: but the wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, for a time, that you may give yourselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: and return together again, lest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> you for your in<a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But I speak this by indulgence, not by <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">commandment</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>By indulgence...</strong> That is, by a condescension to your weakness.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as myself. But every one hath his proper gift from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: one after this manner, and another after that.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But I say to the unmarried and to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>: It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for them if they so continue, even as I.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But if they do not <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">contain</a> themselves, let them <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>. For it is better to <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> than to be burnt. <span class="stiki"><strong>If they do not contain, etc...</strong> This is spoken of such as are free, and not of such as, by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, have given their first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to whom if they will use proper means to obtain it, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will never refuse the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continency</a>. Some translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, <em>if they cannot contain</em>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But to them that are <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a>, not I, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandeth</a> that the wife <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">depart</a> not from her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And if she <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">depart</a>, that she remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For to the rest I speak, not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. If any brother hath a wife that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not and she consent to dwell with him: let him not <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put her away</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>I speak, not the Lord...</strong> Viz., by any express commandment, or ordinance.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And if any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> hath a husband that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not and he consent to dwell with her: let her not <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For the unbelieving husband is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> wife: and the unbelieving wife is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> husband. Otherwise your children should be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: but now they are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Is sanctified...</strong> The meaning is not, that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the husband or the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving party, or their children, in the state of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but that it is very often an occasion of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctification</a>, by bringing them to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath called us in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For how <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> thou, O wife, whether thou shalt <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">save</a> thy husband? Or how <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> thou, O <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whether thou shalt <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">save</a> thy wife?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> hath distributed to every one, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath called every one: so let him walk. And so in all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> I teach.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Is any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> called, being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>? Let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> called in uncircumcision? Let him not be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">Circumcision</a> is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> abide in the same calling in which he was <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">called</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Wast thou <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">called</a>, being a <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondman</a>? Care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For he that is called in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, being a <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondman</a>, is the freeman of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondman</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> You are <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">bought with a price</a>: be not made the <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondslaves</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Brethren, let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wherein he was called, therein abide with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Now, concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give <a href="../cathen/04435a.htm">counsel</a>, as having obtained mercy of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, to be faithful.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> I think therefore that this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the present necessity: that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so to be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Art thou <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">bound</a> to a wife? Seek not to be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">loosed</a>. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But if thou take a wife, thou hast not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. And if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>, she hath not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> This therefore I say, brethren: The time is short. It remaineth, that they also who have wives be as if they had none:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they that weep, as though they wept not: and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not: and they that buy as if they possessed not:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And they that use this world, as if they used it not. For the fashion of this world passeth away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: how he may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may please his wife. And he is divided.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> thinketh on the things of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. But she that is <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> thinketh on the things of the world: how she may please her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, without impediment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> think that he seemeth dishonoured with regard to his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will. He <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> not if she <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let him do what he will; he sinneth not, etc...</strong> The meaning is not, as libertines would have it, that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may do what they will and not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, provided they afterwards <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>; but that the father, with regard to the giving his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>, may do as he pleaseth; and that it will be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to him if she <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> For he that hath determined, being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will: and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, doth well.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Therefore both he that giveth his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> doth well: and he that giveth her not doth better.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her husband die, she is at liberty. Let her <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> to whom she will: only in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But more <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel. And I think that I also have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a>.</span></p>
