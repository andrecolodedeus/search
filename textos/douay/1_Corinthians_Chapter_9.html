<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Am I not I free? Am not I an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>? Have not I seen <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>? Are not you my work in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And if unto others I be not an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostleship</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> My defence with them that do examine me is this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Have not we power to eat and to drink?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Have we not power to carry about a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a sister as well as the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren of the Lord</a> and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>? <span class="stiki"><strong>A woman, a sister...</strong> Some erroneous translators have corrupted this text by rendering it, a sister, a wife: whereas, it is certain, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> had no wife (<a href="../douay/1co007.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 7:7-8</a>) and that he only speaks of such devout <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as, according to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish nation</a>, waited upon the preachers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, and supplied them with necessaries.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Or I only and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, have not we power to do this?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Who serveth as a soldier, at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Speak I these things according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? Or doth not the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> also say; these things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For it is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> take care for oxen?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> and he that thrasheth, in <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> to receive fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that they who work in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">holy place</a> eat the things that are of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">holy place</a>; and they that serve the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> partake with the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So also the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> ordained that they who preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> should live by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to die rather than that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should make my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> void.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For if I preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, it is no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to me: for a necessity lieth upon me. For woe is unto me if I preach not the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>It is no glory...</strong> That is, I have nothing to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, a dispensation is committed to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> What is my reward then? That preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, I may deliver the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> without charge, that I abuse not my power in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I became to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, that I might gain the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> To them that are under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, as if I were under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, (whereas myself was not under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>), that I might gain them that were under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>. To them that were without the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, as if I were without the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, (whereas I was not without the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but was in the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>), that I might gain them that were without the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that I might <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">save</a> all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And I do all things for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel's</a> sake, that I may be made partaker thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize. So run that you may obtain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And every one that striveth for the mastery refraineth himself from all things. And they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown: but we an incorruptible one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But I <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">chastise</a> my body and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway. <span class="stiki"><strong>I chastise, etc...</strong> Here <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> shows the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of self-denial and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, to subdue the flesh, and its inordinate desires.</span></span></p>
