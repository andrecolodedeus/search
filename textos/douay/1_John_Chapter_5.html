There is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto death. For that I say not that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ask. <span class="stiki"><strong>A sin which is not to death, etc...</strong> It is hard to determine what <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> here calls a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not to death, and a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is unto death. The difference can not be the same as betwixt <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are called venial and mortal: for he says, that if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for his brother, who commits a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is not to death, life shall be given him: therefore such a one had before lost the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and been guilty of what is commonly called a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And when he speaks of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is unto death, and adds these words, <em>for that I say not that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ask</em>, it cannot be supposed that <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> would say this of every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only of some heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which are very seldom remitted, because such sinners very seldom repent. By a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> therefore which is unto death, interpreters commonly understand a wilful <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when a sinner, hardened by his own ingratitude, becomes deaf to all <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">admonitions</a>, will do nothing for himself, but runs on to a final impenitence. Nor yet does <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> say, that such a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is never remitted, or cannot be remitted, but only has these words, for that I say not that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ask the remission: that is, though we must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all sinners whatsoever, yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> can not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining always their petitions, as <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> said before (<a href="../douay/1jo005.htm#verse14">verse 14</a>). Whatever exposition we follow on this verse, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> teacheth us from the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">holy scriptures</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> desires not the death of any sinner, but that he be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> and live (<a href="../douay/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). Though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be as red as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow (<a href="../douay/isa003.htm#verse18">Isaiah 3:18</a>). It is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that every one come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so great but which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is willing to forgive, and has left a power in his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> to remit the most enormous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: so that no sinner need despair of pardon, nor will any sinner persist, but by his own fault. <strong>A sin unto death...</strong> Some understand this of final impenitence, or of dying in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; which is the only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that never can be remitted. But, it is probable, he may also comprise under this name, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and some other such heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as are seldom and hardly remitted: and therefore he gives little encouragement, to such as <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for these sinners, to expect what they ask.</span></span>
