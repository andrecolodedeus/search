<h1>1 Kings</h1>

<h2>The First Book of Kings, also called the Third Book of Kings</h2>

<p>This and the following book are called by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">holy fathers</a> the third and fourth book of Kings; but by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, the first and second. They contain the history of the kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, from the beginning of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>. As to the writer of these books, it seems most probable they were not written by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; nor at one time; but as there was all along a succession of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who recorded, by <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">divine inspiration</a>, the most remarkable things that happened in their days, these books seem to have been written by these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. See <a href="../douay/2ch009.htm#verse29">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch012.htm#verse15">12:15</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch013.htm#verse22">13:22</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch020.htm#verse34">20:34</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch026.htm#verse22">26:22</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch032.htm#verse32">32:32</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08652a.htm">THIRD AND FOURTH KINGS</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/1ki001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> King David growing old, Abisag a Sunamitess is brought to him. Adonias pretending to reign, Nathan and Bethsabee obtain that Solomon should be declared and anointed king.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> David, after giving his last charge to Solomon, dieth. Adonias is put to death: Abiathar is banished: Joab and Semei are slain.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> Solomon marrieth Pharao's daughter. He sacrificeth in Gabaon: in the choice which God gave him he preferreth wisdom. His wise judgment between the two harlots.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Solomon's chief officers. His riches and wisdom.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> Hiram king of Tyre agreeth to furnish timber and workmen for building the temple: the number of workmen and overseers.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> The building of Solomon's temple.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> Solomon's palace, his house in the forest, and the queen's house: the work of the two pillars: the sea (or laver) and other vessels.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> The dedication of the temple: Solomon's prayer and sacrifices.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> The Lord appeareth again to Solomon: he buildeth cities: he sendeth a fleet to Ophir.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> The queen of Saba cometh to king Solomon: his riches and glory.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> Solomon by means of his wives falleth into idolatry: God raiseth him adversaries, Adad, Razon, and Jeroboam: Solomon dieth.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> Roboam, following the counsel of young men alienateth from him the minds of the people. They make Jeroboam king over ten tribes: he setteth up idolatry.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> A prophet sent from Juda to Bethel foretelleth the birth of Josias, and the destruction of Jeroboam's altar. Jeroboam's hand offering violence to the prophet withereth, but is restored by the prophet's prayer: the same prophet is deceived by another prophet, and slain by a lion.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> Ahias prophesieth the destruction of the family of Jeroboam. He dieth, and is succeeded by his son Nadab. The king of Egypt taketh and pillageth Jerusalem. Roboam dieth and his son Abiam succeedeth.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> The acts of Abiam and of Asa kings of Juda. And of Nadab and Baasa kings of Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> Jehu prophesieth against Baasa: his son Ela is slain and all his family destroyed by Zambri. Of the reign of Amri father of Achab.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> Elias shutteth up the heaven from raining. He is fed by ravens, and afterwards by a widow of Sarephta. He raiseth the window's son to life.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> Elias cometh before Achab. He convinceth the false prophets by bringing fire from heaven: he obtaineth rain by his prayer.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> Elias, fleeing from Jezabel, is fed by an angel in the desert; and by the strength of that food walketh forty days, till he cometh to Horeb, where he hath a vision of God.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> The Syrians besiege Samaria: they are twice defeated by Achab: who is reprehended by a prophet for letting Benadad go.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> Kaboth, for denying his vineyard to king Achab, is by Jezabel's commandment, falsely accused and stoned to death. For which crime Elias denounceth to Achab the judgments of God: upon his humbling himself the sentence is mitigated.
<br><a href="../douay/1ki022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> Achab believing his false prophets, rather than Micheas, is slain in Ramoth Galaad. Ochozias succeedeth him. Good king Josaphat dieth, and his son Joram succeedeth him.
