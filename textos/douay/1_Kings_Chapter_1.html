<div class="h1a">King David growing old, Abisag a Sunamitess is brought to him. Adonias pretending to reign, Nathan and Bethsabee obtain that Solomon should be declared and anointed king.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with clothes he was not warm.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> His servants therefore, said to him: Let us seek for our Lord the king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom and warm our lord the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So they sought a beautiful young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, in all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and they found Abisag, a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the damsel was exceedingly beautiful, and she slept with the king, and served him, but the king did not know her.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/07106a.htm">Haggith</a>, exalted himself, saying: I will be king. And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to run before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done this? And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he conferred with Joab, the son of Sarvia, and with <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who furthered <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias'</a> side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> army, was not with <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all his brethren, the king's sons, and all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, the king's servants:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, his brother, he invited not.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> said to Bethsabee, the mother of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: Hast thou not heard that <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/07106a.htm">Haggith</a>, reigneth, and our lord <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> knoweth it not?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now then, come, take my counsel, and save thy life, and the life of thy son <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Go, and get thee in to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to me, thy handmaid, saying: <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> reign?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after thee, and will fill up thy words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber. Now the king was very old, and Abisag, the Sunamitess, ministered to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king said to her: What is thy will?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> She answered, and said: My lord, thou didst <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to thy handmaid, by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And behold, now <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> reigneth, and thou, my lord the king, knowest nothing of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He hath killed oxen, and all fat cattle, and many rams, and invited all the king's sons, and <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Joab, the general of the army: but <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, thy servant, he invited not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And now, my lord, O king, the eyes of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the king, after thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I, and my son, <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, shall be accounted offenders.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> As she was yet speaking with the king, <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, came.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they told the king, saying: <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, is here. And when he was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to the ground,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> said: My lord, O king, hast thou said: Let <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Because he is gone down to day, and hath killed oxen, and fatlings, and many rams, and invited all the king's sons, and the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army, and <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">king Adonias</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But me, thy servant, and Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, thy servant, he hath not invited.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not told me, thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> answered, and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was come in to the king, and stood before him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> The king <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a>, and said: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, who hath delivered my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> out of all distress,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Even as I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to thee, by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And Bethsabee, bowing with her face to the earth, worshipped the king, saying: May my lord <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> live for ever.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> also said: Call me Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>. And when they were come in before the king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set my son <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And let Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, anoint him there king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>, answered the king, saying: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>: so say the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my lord the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath been with my lord the king, so be he with <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> So Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, went down, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> upon the mule of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, and brought him to Gihon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, took a horn of oil out of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and anointed <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: and they sounded the trumpet, and all the people said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes, and rejoiced with a great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and the earth rang with the noise of their cry.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now the feast was at an end. Joab also, hearing the sound of the trumpet, said: What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> While he yet spoke, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, came: and <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> said to him: Come in, because thou art a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and bringest <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> news.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> answered <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>: Not so: for our lord, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, hath appointed <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> king;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And hath sent with him Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>, and the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and they have set him upon the king's mule:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan, the prophet</a>, have anointed him king, in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again: this is the noise that you have heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Moreover, <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And the king's servants going in, have <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> our lord <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, saying: May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> make the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> greater than thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> in his bed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And he said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who hath given this day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Then all the guests of <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> were afraid, and they all arose, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went his way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> fearing <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, arose and went, and took hold of the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horn of the altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And they told <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, saying: Behold <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> fearing <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>, hath taken hold of the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horn of the altar</a>, saying: Let <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> said: If he be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, there shall not so much as one hair of his head fall to the ground: but if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be found in him, he shall die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> Then <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> sent, and brought him out from the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: and going in, he worshipped <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>: and <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> said to him: Go to thy house.</span></p>
