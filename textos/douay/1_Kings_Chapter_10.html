<div class="h1a">The queen of Saba comes to King Solomon: his riches and glory.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the queen of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a> having heard of the fame of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, came to try him with hard questions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And entering into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with a great train, and riches, and camels that carried spices, and an immense quantity of gold, and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>, she came to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>, and spoke to him all that she had in her heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> informed her of all the things she proposed to him: there was not any word the king was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, and which he could not answer her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when the queen of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a> saw all the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and the house which he had built,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the meat of his table, and the apartments of his servants, and the order of his ministers, and their apparel, and the cupbearers, and the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, which he offered in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, she had no longer any spirit in her;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And she said to the king: The report is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, which I heard in my own country,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom. And I did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them that told me, till I came myself, and saw with my own eyes, and have found that the half hath not been told me: thy wisdom and thy works exceed the fame which I heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> are thy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> are thy servants, who stand before thee always, and hear thy wisdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, whom thou hast pleased, and who hath set thee upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for ever, and hath appointed thee king, to do judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great store, and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>: there was brought no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a> gave to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> (The navy also of Hiram, which brought gold from <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a>, brought from <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a> great plenty of thyine trees, and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the king made of the thyine trees the rails of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and of the king's house: and citterns and harps for singers: there were no such thyine trees as these brought nor seen unto this day.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> gave the queen of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a> all that she desired, and asked of him: besides what he offered her of himself of his royal bounty. And she returned, and went to her own country, with her servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the weight of the gold that was brought to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> every year, was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Besides that which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> brought him that were over the tributes, and the merchants, and they that sold by retail, and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> made two hundred shields of the purest gold: he allowed six hundred sicles of gold for the plates of one shield.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And three hundred targets of fine gold: three hundred pounds of gold covered one target: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Libanus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">King Solomon</a> also made a great throne of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>: and overlaid it with the finest gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> It had six steps: and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were two hands on either side holding the seat: and two lions stood, one at each hand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And twelve little lions stood upon the six steps, on the one side and on the other: there was no such work made in any kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Moreover, all the vessels out of which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> drank, were of gold: and all the furniture of the house of the forest of Libanus was of most pure gold: there was no silver, nor was any account made of it in the days of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For the king's navy, once in three years, went with the navy of Hiram by sea to Tharsis, and brought from thence gold, and silver, and elephants' teeth, and apes, and peacocks.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And all the earth desired to see <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a> face, to hear his wisdom, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had given in his heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And every one brought him presents, vessels of silver and of gold, garments, and armour, and spices, and horses, and mules, every year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> gathered together chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he bestowed them in fenced cities, and with the king in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he made silver to be as plentiful in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as stones: and <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a> to be as common as sycamores which grow in the plains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And horses were brought for <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and Coa: for the king's merchants bought them out of Coa, and brought them at a set price.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And a chariot of four horses came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, for six hundred sicles of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And after this manner did all the kings of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethites</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, sell horses.</span></p>
