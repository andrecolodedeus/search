<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Of the nations concerning which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: You shall not go in unto them, neither shall any of them come into yours: for they will most certainly turn away your hearts to follow their gods. And to these was <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> joined with a most ardent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he had seven hundred wives as queens, and three hundred <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> turned away his heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when he was now old, his heart was turned away by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to follow strange gods: and his heart was not perfect with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was the heart of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> worshipped Astarthe, the goddess of the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a>, the idol of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> did that which was not pleasing before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and did not fully follow the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> built a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> for Chamos, the idol of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, on the hill that is over against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and for <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a>, the idol of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he did in this manner for all his wives that were strangers, who burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to their gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, because his mind was turned away from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who had appeared to him twice;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not follow strange gods: but he kept not the things which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> therefore said to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: Because thou hast done this, and hast not kept my covenant, and my precepts, which I have commanded thee, I will divide and rend thy kingdom, and will give it to thy servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Nevertheless, in thy days I will not do it, for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Neither will I take away the whole kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my servant, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which I have chosen. <span class="stiki"><strong>One tribe...</strong> Besides that of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, his own native <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> raised up an adversary to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, Adad, the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomite</a>, of the king's seed, in <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was in <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, and Joab, the general of the army, was gone up to bury them that were slain, and had killed every male in <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> (For Joab remained there six months with all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, till he had slain every male in <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then Adad fled, he and certain <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a> of his father's servants, with him, to go into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and Adad was then a little boy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they arose out of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, and came into Pharan, and they took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with them from Pharan, and went into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and assigned him land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Adad found great favour before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, insomuch that he gave him to wife the own sister of his wife, Taphnes, the queen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son, Genubath; and Taphnes brought him up in the house of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: and Genubath dwelt with <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> among his children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when Adad heard in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slept with his fathers, and that Joab, the general of the army, was dead, he said to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> said to him: Why, what is wanting to thee with me, that thou seekest to go to thy own country? But he answered: Nothing; yet I beseech thee to let me go.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also raised up against him an adversary, Razon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Adarezer, the king of Soba.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he gathered <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> against him, and he became a <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of robbers, when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slew them of Soba: and they went to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and dwelt there, and they made him king in <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he was an adversary to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> all the days of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: and this is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of Adad, and his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and he reigned in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> also, the son of Nabat, an <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Ephrathite</a>, of Sareda, a servant of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, whose mother was <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Sarua, a widow <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, lifted up his hand against the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And this is the cause of his rebellion against him; for <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> built Mello, and filled up the breach of the city of David, his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> was a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> and mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> seeing him a young man ingenious and industrious, made him chief over the tributes of all the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">house of Joseph</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So it came to pass at that time, that <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> went out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ahias, the Silonite, clad with a new garment, found him in the way: and they two were alone in the field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And Ahias taking his new garment, wherewith he was clad, divided it into twelve parts:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>: Take to thee ten pieces: for thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and will give thee ten tribes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the city which I have chosen out of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Because he hath forsaken me, and hath <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> Astarthe, the goddess of the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>, and Chamos, the god of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a>, the god of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>: and hath not walked in my ways, to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> before me, and to keep my precepts, and judgments, as did <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my servant's sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments, and my precepts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But I will take away the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give thee ten tribes:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And to his son I will give one tribe, that there may remain a lamp for my servant, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, before me always in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the city which I have chosen, that my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> might be there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desireth, and thou shalt be king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do what is right before me, keeping my commandments and my precepts, as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my servant, did: I will be with thee, and will build thee up a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> house, as I built a house for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and I will deliver <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And I will for this afflict the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, but yet not for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, therefore, sought to kill <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>: but he arose, and fled into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to Sesac, the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and was in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> till the death of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>.</span></p>
