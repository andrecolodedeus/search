<h1>1 Kings Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">Roboam, following the counsel of young men alienates from him the minds of the people. They make Jeroboam king over ten tribes: he sets up idolatry.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Roboam went to <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>: for thither were all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> come together to make him king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, who was yet in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, a fugitive from the face of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>, hearing of his death, returned out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they sent and called him: and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> came, and all the multitude of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Thy father laid a grievous yoke upon us: now, therefore, do thou take off a little of the grievous service of thy father, and of his most heavy yoke, which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to them: Go till the third day, and come to me again. And when the people was gone,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> King Roboam took counsel with the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that stood before <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, his father, while he yet lived, and he said: What counsel do you give me, that I may answer this people?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They said to him: If thou wilt yield to this people to day, and condescend to them, and grant their petition, and wilt speak gentle words to them, they will be thy servants always.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But he left the counsel of the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that had been brought up with him, and stood before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to them: What counsel do you give me, that I may answer this people, who have said to me: Make the yoke, which thy father put upon us, lighter?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the young men that had been brought up with him, said: Thus shalt thou speak to this people, who have spoken to thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease us. Thou shalt say to them: My little finger is thicker than the back of my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And now my father put a heavy yoke upon you, but I will add to your yoke: my father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and all the people, came to Roboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying: Come to me again the third day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the king answered the people roughly, leaving the counsel of the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which they had given him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying: My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the king condescended not to the people: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was turned away from him, to make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> his word, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias, the Silonite, to <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then the people, seeing that the king would not hearken to them, answered him, saying: What portion have we in <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>? or what inheritance in the son of Isai? Go home to thy dwellings, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: now, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, look to thy own house. So <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> departed to their dwellings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But as for all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> that dwelt in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, Roboam reigned over them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tribute: and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him, and he died. Wherefore king Roboam made haste to get him up into his chariot, and he fled to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> revolted from the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And it came to pass when all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> heard that <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> was come again, that they gathered an assembly, and sent and called him, and made him king over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and there was none that followed the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> but the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a> only. <span class="stiki"><strong>Juda only...</strong> <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> was a small <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>, and so intermixed with the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>, (the very city of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> being partly in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, partly in <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>), that they are here counted but as one <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Roboam came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and gathered together all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>, a hundred fourscore thousand chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, to fight against the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and to bring the kingdom again under Roboam, the son of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Semeias, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Speak to Roboam, the son of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and to all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and the rest of the people, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: You shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> return to his house, for this thing is from me. They hearkened to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, and returned from their journey, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> built <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a> in mount Ephraim, and dwelt there, and going out from thence, he built Phanuel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> said in his heart: Now shall the kingdom return to the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> If this people go up to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and the heart of this people will turn to their lord Roboam, the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and they will kill me, and return to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And finding out a device, he made two golden calves, and said to them: Go ye up no more to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: Behold thy gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who brought thee out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Golden calves...</strong> It is likely, by making his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> in this form, he mimicked the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, among whom he had sojourned, who <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipped</a> their Apis and their Osiris under the form of a bullock.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he set the one in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and the other in <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>Bethel and Dan...</strong> <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> was a city of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> of Ephraim in the southern part of the dominions of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, about six leagues from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a> was in the extremity of his dominions to the north in the confines of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And this thing became an <a href="../cathen/11196a.htm">occasion of sin</a>: for the people went to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the calf as far as <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he made <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> in the high places, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the lowest of the people, who were not of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, after the manner of the feast that was celebrated in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>. And going up to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, he did in like manner in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the calves, which he had made: and he placed in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the high places, which he had made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he went up to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, which he had built in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and went up on the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>.</span></p>
