<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he cried out against the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, and said: O <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold a child shall be born to the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> by <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and he shall immolate upon thee the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the high places, who now burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> upon thee, and he shall burn <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> bones upon thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he gave a sign the same day, saying: This shall be the sign, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken: Behold the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it, shall be poured out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when the king had heard the word of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he had cried out against the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, he stretched forth his hand from the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, saying: Lay hold on him.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> also was rent, and the ashes were poured out from the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, according to the sign which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had given before in the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the king said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: Entreat the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me, that my hand may be restored to me. And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> besought the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the king's hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the king said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: Come home with me to dine, and I will make thee presents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> answered the king: If thou wouldst give me half thy house, I will not go with thee, nor eat bread, nor drink water in this place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For so it was enjoined me by the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> commanding me: Thou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way that thou camest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way that he came into <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now a certain old <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> dwelt in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and his sons came to him, and told him all the works that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had done that day in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>: and they told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And their father said to them: What way went he? His sons showed him the way by which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went, who came out of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he said to his sons: Saddle me the ass. And when they had saddled it, he got up,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And went after the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and found him sitting under a turpentine tree: and he said to him: Art thou the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who camest from <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>? He answered: I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to him: Come home with me to eat bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But he said: I must not return, nor go with thee, neither will I eat bread, or drink water in this place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to me, in the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, saying: Thou shalt not eat bread, and thou shalt not drink water there, nor return by the way thou wentest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He said to him: I also am a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> like unto thee: and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> spoke to me, in the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, saying: Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread, and drink water. He deceived him, <span class="stiki"><strong>An angel spoke to me, etc...</strong> This old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> was indeed a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in thus deceiving the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the more because he pretended a <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelation</a> for what he did.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And brought him back with him: so he ate bread, and drank water in his house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And as they sat at table, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that brought him back:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he cried out to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who came out of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saying: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Because thou hast not been <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and hast not kept the commandment which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> commanded thee,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And hast returned, and eaten bread, and drunk water in the place wherein he commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat bread, nor drink water, thy dead body shall not be brought into the sepulchre of thy fathers.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when he had eaten and drunk, he saddled his ass for the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, whom he had brought back.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when he was gone, a lion found him in the way, and killed him, and his body was cast in the way: and the ass stood by him, and the lion stood by the dead body. <span class="stiki"><strong>Killed him...</strong> Thus the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> often punishes his servants here, that he may spare them hereafter. For the generality of divines are of opinion, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, considered with all its circumstances, was not mortal.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And behold, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> passing by, saw the dead body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city, wherein that old <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> dwelt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who had brought him back out of the way, heard of it, he said: It is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that was disobedient to the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered him to the lion, and he hath torn him, and killed him, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which he spoke to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he said to his sons: Saddle me an ass. And when they had saddled it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he was gone, he found the dead body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten of the dead body, nor hurt the ass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> took up the body of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and laid it upon the ass, and going back brought it into the city of the old <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, to mourn for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he laid his dead body in his own sepulchre: and they mourned over him, saying: Alas! alas, my brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when they had mourned over him, he said to his sons: When I am dead, bury me in the sepulchre wherein the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is buried: lay my bones beside his bones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> For assuredly the word shall come to pass which he hath foretold in the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>: and against all the temples of the high places, that are in the cities of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> After these words, <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> came not back from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> way: but on the contrary, he made of the meanest of the people <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the high places: whosoever would, he filled his hand, and he was made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the high places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And for this cause did the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and was cut off, and destroyed from the face of the earth.</span></p>
