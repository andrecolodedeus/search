<div class="h1a">Ahias prophesies the destruction of the family of Jeroboam. He dies, and is succeeded by his son Nadab. The king of Egypt takes and pillages Jerusalem. Roboam dies and his son Abiam succeeds.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> At that time Abia, the son of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, fell sick.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> said to his wife: Arise, and change thy dress, that thou be not known to be the wife of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and go to Silo, where Ahias, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is, who told me that I should reign over this people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Take also with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a pot of honey, and go to him: for he will tell thee what will become of this child.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam's</a> wife did as he told her: and rising up, went to Silo, and came to the house of Ahias; but he could not see, for his eyes were dim by reason of his age.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to Ahias: Behold the wife of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> cometh in, to consult thee concerning her son, that is sick: thus and thus shalt thou speak to her. So when she was coming in, and made as if she were another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Ahias heard the sound of her feet, coming in at the door, and said: Come in, thou wife of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>: why dost thou feign thyself to be another? But I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Go, and tell <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: For as much as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And rent the kingdom away from the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and gave it to thee, and thou hast not been as my servant, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, who kept my commandments, and followed me with all his heart, doing that which was well pleasing in my sight:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But hast done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> above all that were before thee, and hast made thee strange gods, and molten gods, to provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and hast cast me behind thy back:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore, behold I will bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and will cut off from <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the last in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and I will sweep away the remnant of the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, as dung is swept away till all be clean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Them that shall die of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> in the city, the dogs shall eat: and them that shall die in the field, the birds of the air shall devour: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Arise thou, therefore, and go to thy house: and when thy feet shall be entering into the city, the child shall die,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for he only of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> shall be laid in a sepulchre, because in his regard there is found a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> word from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath appointed himself a king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who shall cut off the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> in this day, and in this time:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> shall strike <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> as a reed is shaken in the water: and he shall root up <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river: because they have made to themselves groves, to provoke the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall give up <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, who hath <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the wife of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> arose, and departed, and came to Thersa: and when she was coming in to the threshold of the house, the child died,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they buried him. And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> mourned for him, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahias, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold they are written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel...</strong> This book, which is often mentioned in the <a href="../douay/1ki000.htm">Book of Kings</a>, is long since lost. For as to the books of <a href="../douay/1ch000.htm">Paralipomenon</a>, or <a href="../douay/1ch000.htm">Chronicles</a>, (which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a> call the words of the days), they were certainly written after the <a href="../douay/1ki000.htm">Book of Kings</a>, since they frequently refer to them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the days that <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> reigned, were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers: and Nadab, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Roboam, the son of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, reigned in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: Roboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned seventeen years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the city which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> chose out of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> to put his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> there. And his mother's <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Naama, an <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonitess</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and provoked him above all that their fathers had done, in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they committed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For they also built them <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, and statues, and groves, upon every high hill, and under every green tree:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> There were also the effeminate in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the people, whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had destroyed before the face of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The effeminate...</strong> Catamites, or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> addicted to unnatural <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac, king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, came up against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he took away the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the king's treasures, and carried all off: as also the shields of gold which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had made:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Roboam made shields of brass instead of them, and delivered them into the hand of the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the shieldbearers, and of them that kept watch before the gate of the king's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when the king went into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, they whose office it was to go before him, carried them: and afterwards they brought them back to the armoury of the shieldbearers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Now the rest of the acts of Roboam, and all that he did, behold they are written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Roboam and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> always.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with them, in the city of David: and his mother's <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Naama, an <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonitess</a>: and Abiam, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
