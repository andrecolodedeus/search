<h1>1 Kings Chapter 15</h1>
<div class="h1a">The acts of Abiam and of Asa kings of Judah. And of Nadab and Baasa kings of Israel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now in the eighteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, Abiam reigned over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He reigned three years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Maacha, the daughter of Abessalom. <span class="stiki"><strong>Maacha, etc...</strong> She is called elsewhere Michaia, daughter of Uriel; but it was common in those days for the same person to have two <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he walked in all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was the heart of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> sake the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave him a lamp in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to set up his son after him, and to establish <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Because <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had done that which was right in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and had not turned aside from any thing that he commanded him, all the days of his life, except the matter of Urias, the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Roboam and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> all the time of his life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the rest of the words of Abiam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>? And there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Abiam and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Abiam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So in the twentieth year of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, reigned Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he reigned one and forty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. His mother's <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Maacha, the daughter of Abessalom. <span class="stiki"><strong>His mother, etc...</strong> That is, his grandmother; unless we suppose, which is not improbable, that the Maacha here <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> is different from the Maacha mentioned, <a href="../douay/1ki015.htm#verse2">verse 2</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as did <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he took away the effeminate out of the land, and removed all the filth of the idols, which his fathers had made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Moreover, he also removed his mother, Maacha, from being the princess in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of Priapus, and in the grove which she had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to him: and he destroyed her den, and broke in pieces the filthy idol, and burnt it by the <a href="../cathen/03475c.htm">torrent Cedron</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But the high places he did not take away. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was perfect with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> all his days: <span class="stiki"><strong>The high places...</strong> There were <em>excelsa</em> or high places of two different kinds. Some were set up, and <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship of idols</a>, or strange gods; and these Asa removed, <a href="../douay/2ch014.htm#verse2">2 Chronicles 14:2</a>; others were only <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but were erected contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, which allowed of no <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> but in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>; and these were not removed by Asa. -- Ibid. <strong>Perfect with the Lord...</strong> Asa had his faults; but never forsook the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he brought in the things which his father had <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a>, and he had <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a>, into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, silver and gold, and vessels.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Asa, and Baasa, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, all their days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Baasa, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, went up against <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and built Rama, that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might go out or come in of the side of Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and in the treasures of the king's house, and delivered it into the hands of his servants: and sent them to Benadad, son of Tabremon, the son of Hezion, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: therefore I have sent thee presents of silver and gold: and I desire thee to come, and break thy league with Baasa, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that he may depart from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Benadad, hearkening to king Asa, sent the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of his army against the cities of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they smote Ahion, and <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">Abeldomum Maacha</a>, and all Cenneroth; that is all the land of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthali</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when Baasa had heard this, he left off building Rama, and returned into Thersa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But king Asa sent word into all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saying: Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be excused: and they took away the stones from Rama, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasa had been building, and with them king Asa built Gabaa of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his strength, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, his father. And Josaphat, his son, reigned in his place.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But Nadab, the son of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> the second year of Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and he reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> two years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and walked in the ways of his father, and in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherewith he made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Baasa, the son of Ahias, of the <a href="../cathen/08201a.htm">house of Issachar</a>, conspired against him, and slew him in Gebbethon, which is a city of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: for Nadab and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> besieged Gebbethon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So Baasa slew him in the third year of Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and reigned in his place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when he was king, he cut off all the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>: he left not so much as one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of his seed, till he had utterly destroyed him, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias, the Silonite:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Because of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, which he had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and wherewith he had made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and for the offence wherewith he provoked the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Asa and Baasa, the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, all their days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> In the third year of Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, Baasa, the son of Ahias, reigned over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in Thersa, four and twenty years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and walked in the ways of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherewith he made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></p>
