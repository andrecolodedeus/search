<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, the son of Hanani, against Baasa, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For as much as I have exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and thou hast walked in the way of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and hast made my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Behold I will cut down the posterity of Baasa, and the posterity of his house, and I will make thy house as the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Him that dieth of Baasa, in the city, the dogs shall eat: and him that dieth of his in the country, the fowls of the air shall devour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But the rest of the acts of Baasa, and all that he did, and his battles, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So Baasa slept with his fathers, and was buried in Thersa: and Ela, his son, reigned in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came in the hand of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, the son of Hanani, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, against Baasa, and against his house, and against all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he had done before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to provoke him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by the works of his hands, to become as the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>: for this cause he slew him; that is to say, <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, the son of Hanani, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And his servant Zambri, who was <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of half the horsemen, rebelled against him: now Ela was drinking in Thersa, and drunk in the house of Arsa, the governor of Thersa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Zambri rushing in, struck him, and slew him, in the seven and twentieth year of Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and he reigned in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when he was king, and sat upon his throne, he slew all the house of Baasa, and he left not one thereof to piss against a wall and all his kinsfolk and friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Zambri destroyed all the house of Baasa, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, that he had spoken to Baasa, in the hand of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of Baasa, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of Ela, his son, who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, provoking the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, with their vanities.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> In the seven and twentieth year of Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, Zambri reigned seven days in Thersa: now the army was besieging Gebbethon, a city of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when they heard that Zambri had rebelled, and slain the king, all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> made Amri their king, who was general over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the camp that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Amri went up, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with him, from Gebbethon, and they besieged Thersa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Zambri, seeing that the city was about to be taken, went into the palace, and burnt himself with the king's house: and he died</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> In his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which he had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and walking in the way of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherewith he made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But the rest of the acts of Zambri, and of his conspiracy and tyranny, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then were the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> divided into two parts: one half of the people followed Thebni, the son of Gineth, to make him king: and one half followed Amri.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But the people that were with Amri, prevailed over the people that followed Thebni, the son of Gineth: and Thebni died, and Amri reigned.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> In the one and thirtieth year of Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, Amri reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> twelve years: in Thersa he reigned six years. <span class="stiki"><strong>In the one and thirtieth year, etc...</strong> Amri began to reign in the seven and twentieth year of Asa; but had not quiet possession of the kingdom till the death of his competitor Thebni, which was in the one and thirtieth year of Asa's reign.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he bought the hill of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> of Semer, for two talents of silver: and he built upon it, and he called the city which he built <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of Semer, the owner of the hill.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And Amri did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and acted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a> above all that were before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he walked in all the way of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, and in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherewith he made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: to provoke the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with their vanities. <span class="stiki"><strong>With their vanities...</strong> That is, their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, their <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calves</a>, vain, false, deceitful things.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amri, and the battles he fought, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And Amri slept with his fathers, and was buried in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Now <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, the son of Amri, reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the eight and thirtieth year of Asa, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he set up an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> for <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, which he had built in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he planted a grove: and <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> did more to provoke the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, than all the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that were before him.</span>
