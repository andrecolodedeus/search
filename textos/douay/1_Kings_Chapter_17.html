<div class="h1a">Elias shuts up the heaven from raining. He is fed by ravens, and afterwards by a widow of Sarephta. He raises the window's son to life.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias the Thesbite</a>, of the inhabitants of Galaad, said to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in whose sight I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to the words of my mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to him, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Get thee hence, and go towards the east, and hide thyself by the torrent of Carith, which is over against the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And there thou shalt drink of the torrent: and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So he went, and did according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>: and going, he dwelt by the torrent Carith, which is over against the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the torrent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But after some time the torrent was dried up: for it had not rained upon the earth.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to him, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Arise, and go to Sarephta of the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>, and dwell there: for I have commanded a widow <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> there to feed thee. <span class="stiki"><strong>Sarephta of the Sidonians...</strong> That is, a city of the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He arose, and went to Sarephta. And when he was come to the gate of the city, he saw the widow <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> gathering sticks, and he called her, and said to her: Give me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when she was going to fetch it, he called after her, saying: Bring me also, I beseech thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And she answered: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> liveth, I have no bread, but only a handful of meal in a pot, and a little oil in a cruise: behold I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it, for me and my son, that we may eat it and die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> said to her: Fear not; but go, and do as thou hast said but first make for me of the same meal a little hearth cake, and bring it to me, and after make for thyself and thy son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: The pot of meal shall not waste, nor the cruise of oil be diminished, until the day wherein the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will give rain upon the face of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> She went, and did according to the word of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>: and he ate, and she, and her house: and from that day</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The pot of meal wasted not, and the cruise of oil was not diminished according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which he spoke in the hand of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And it came to pass after this, that the son of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the mistress of the house, fell sick, and the sickness was very grievous, so that there was no breath left in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And she said to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>: What have I to do with thee, thou <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? art thou come to me, that my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> should be remembered, and that thou shouldst kill my son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> said to her: Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him into the upper chamber where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hast thou afflicted also the widow, with whom I am after a sort maintained, so as to kill her son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he stretched, and measured himself upon the child three times, and cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of this child, I beseech thee, return into his body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard the voice of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the child returned into him, and he revived.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> took the child, and brought him down from the upper chamber to the house below, and delivered him to his mother, and said to her: Behold thy son liveth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>: Now by this I know that thou art a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> in thy mouth is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</span></p>
