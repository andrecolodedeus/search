<div class="h1a">Elias comes before Achab. He convinces the false prophets by bringing fire from heaven: he obtains rain by his prayer.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After many days, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, in the third year, saying: Go, and show thyself to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, that I may give rain upon the face of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> went to show himself to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, and there was a grievous famine in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> called Abdias the governor of his house: now Abdias feared the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> very much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For when <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> killed the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he took a hundred <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and hid them by fifty and fifty in caves, and fed them with bread and water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> said to Abdias: Go into the land unto all fountains of waters, and into all valleys, to see if we can find grass, and save the horses and mules, that the beasts may not utterly perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they divided the countries between them, that they might go round about them: <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> went one way, and Abdias another way by himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And as Abdias was in the way, <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said: Art thou my lord <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he answered: I am. Go, and tell thy master: <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> is here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said: What have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, that thou wouldst deliver me, thy servant, into the hand of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, that he should kill me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when all answered: He is not here: he took an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of every kingdom and nation, because thou wast not found.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And now thou sayest to me: Go and tell thy master: <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> is here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when I am gone from thee, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> will carry thee into a place that I know not: and I shall go in and tell <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>; and he, not finding thee, will kill me: but thy servant feareth the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> from his infancy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Hath it not been told thee, my lord, what I did when <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> killed the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; how I hid a hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, by fifty and fifty in caves, and fed them with bread and water?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And now thou sayest: Go and tell thy master: <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> is here: that he may kill me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> said: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> liveth, before whose face I stand, this day I will show myself unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Abdias therefore went to meet <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, and told him: and <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> came to meet <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when he had seen him, he said: Art thou he that troublest <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said: I have not troubled <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but thou and thy father's house, who have forsaken the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and have followed <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Nevertheless send now, and gather unto me all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, unto <a href="../cathen/03352a.htm">Mount Carmel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> four hundred and fifty, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the groves four hundred, who eat at <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel's</a> table.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> sent to all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and gathered together the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> unto <a href="../cathen/03352a.htm">mount Carmel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> coming to all the people, said: How long do you halt between two sides? If the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, follow him: but if <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, then follow him. And the people did not answer him a word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> said again to the people: I only remain a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> are four hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Let two bullocks be given us, and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it upon wood, but put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Call ye on the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of your gods, and I will call on the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that shall answer by fire, let him be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And all the people answering, said: A very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> proposal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Then <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>: Choose you one bullock and dress it first, because you are many: and call on the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of your gods; but put no fire under.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they took the bullock, which he gave them, and dressed it: and they called on the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> from morning even until noon, saying: O <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered: and they leaped over the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> that they had made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when it was now noon, <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> jested at them, saying: Cry with a louder voice: for he is a god; and perhaps he is talking, or is in an inn, or on a journey; or perhaps he is asleep, and must be awaked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So they cried with a loud voice, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till they were all covered with blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And after midday was past, and while they were <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a>, the time was come of <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and there was no voice heard, nor did any one answer, nor regard them as they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> said to all the people: Come ye unto me. And the people coming near unto him, he repaired the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that was broken down:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he took twelve stones, according to the number of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes of the sons of Jacob</a> to whom the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came, saying: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he built with the stones an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and he made a trench for water, of the breadth of two furrows, round about the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he laid the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it upon the wood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he said: Fill four buckets with water, and pour it upon the burnt <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a>, and upon the wood. And again he said: Do the same the second time. And when they had done it the second time, he said: Do the same also the third time. And they did so the third time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the water run round about the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and the trench was filled with water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And when it was now time to offer the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, came near and said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a>, show this day that thou art the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and I thy servant, and that according to thy commandment I have done all these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Dear me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, hear me: that this people may learn that thou art the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and that thou hast turned their heart again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Then the fire of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> fell, and consumed the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And when all the people saw this, they fell on their faces, and they said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> said to them: Take the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and let not one of them escape. And when they had taken them, <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> brought them down to the torrent Cison, and killed them there.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>: Go up, eat and drink: for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> went up to eat and drink: and <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> went up to the top of <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>, and casting himself down upon the earth, put his face between his knees,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And he said to his servant: Go up, and look towards the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said: There is nothing. And again he said to him: Return seven times.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And at the seventh time: Behold a little cloud arose out of the sea like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> foot. And he said: Go up, and say to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>: Prepare thy chariot, and go down, lest the rain prevent thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And while he turned himself this way and that way, behold the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> grew dark, with clouds and wind, and there fell a great rain. And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> getting up, went away to Jezrahel:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was upon <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and he girded up his loins, and ran before <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, till he came to Jezrahel.</span></p>
