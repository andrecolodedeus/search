<div class="h1a">Elias, fleeing from Jezabel, is fed by an angel in the desert; and by the strength of that food walks forty days, till he comes to Horeb, where he has a vision of God.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> told <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> all that <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> had done, and how he had slain all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> sent a messenger to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, saying: Such and such things may the gods do to me, and add still more, if by this hour tomorrow I make not thy life as the life of one of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> was afraid, and rising up, he went whithersoever he had a mind: and he came to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a> of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and left his servant there,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he went forward, one day's journey into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. And when he was there, and sat under a juniper tree, he requested for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that he might die, and said: It is enough for me, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; take away my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for I am no better than my fathers. <span class="stiki"><strong>That he might die...</strong> <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> requested to die, not out of impatience or pusillanimity, but out of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and that he might no longer be witness of the miseries of his people; and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> they were waging against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his servants. See <a href="../douay/1ki019.htm#verse10">verse 10</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he cast himself down, and slept in the shadow of the juniper tree: and behold an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> touched him, and said to him: Arise and eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He looked, and behold there was at his head a hearth cake, and a vessel of water: and he ate and drank, and he fell asleep again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> came again the second time, and touched him, and said to him: Arise, eat: for thou hast yet a great way to go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he arose, and ate and drank, and walked in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights, unto the mount of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>In the strength of that food, etc...</strong> This bread, with which <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> was fed in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, was a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of the bread of life which we receive in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">blessed sacrament</a>; by the strength of which we are to be supported in our journey through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of this world till we come to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> in a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">happy eternity</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when he was come thither, he abode in a cave and behold the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came unto him, and he said to him: What dost thou here, <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he answered: With zeal have I been zealous for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> have forsaken thy covenant: they have thrown down thy <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, they have slain thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with the sword, and I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it away. <span class="stiki"><strong>I alone am left...</strong> Viz., of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, or of the ten tribes; for in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> was at that time in a very flourishing condition under the kings Asa and Josaphat.

See <a href="../douay/1ki020.htm#verse13">1 Kings 20:13, 28, 35</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said to him: Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> passeth, and a great and strong wind before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, overthrowing the mountains, and breaking the rocks in pieces: but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is not in the wind.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And after the earthquake, a fire: but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is not in the fire. And after the fire, a whistling of a gentle air.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> heard it, he covered his face with his mantle, and coming forth, stood in the entering in of the cave, and behold a voice unto him, saying: What dost thou here, <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>? And he answered:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> With zeal have I been zealous for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> have forsaken thy covenant: they have destroyed thy <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, they have slain thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with the sword; and I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Go, and return on thy way, through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>: and when thou art come thither, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And thou shalt anoint <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, the son of Namsi, to be king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, the son of Saphat, of <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">Abelmeula</a>, thou shalt anoint to be <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in thy room.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall escape the sword of Hazael, shall be slain by <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>: and whosoever shall escape the sword of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, shall be slain by <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Shall be slain by Eliseus...</strong> <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> did not kill any of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> with the material sword: but he is here joined with Hazael and <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, the great instruments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in punishing the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because he foretold to the former his exaltation to the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and the vengeance he would execute against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and anointed the latter by one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, with commission to extirpate the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I will leave me seven thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whose knees have not been bowed before <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and every mouth that hath not worshipped him, <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> the hands.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> departing from thence, found <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, the son of Saphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen: and he was one of them that were ploughing with, twelve yoke of oxen: and when <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> came up to him, he cast his mantle upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he forthwith left the oxen, and run after <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and said: Let me, I pray thee, <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And returning back from him, he took a yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled the flesh with the plough of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate: and rising up, he went away, and followed <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and ministered to him.</span></p>
