<div class="h1a">David, after giving his last charge to Solomon, dies. Adonias is put to death: Abiathar is banished: Joab and Semei are slain.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the days of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I am going the way of all flesh: take thou <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and show thyself a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And keep the charge of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, to walk in his ways, and observe his <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>: that thou mayst understand all thou dost, and whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> That the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, with all their heart, and with all their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there shall not be taken away from thee a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the throne of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Sarvia, hath done to me, what he did to the two <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, the son of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in peace, and put the blood of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. <span class="stiki"><strong>Joab...</strong> These instructions given by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to his son, with relation to Joab and Semei, proceeded not from any rancour of heart, or private pique; but from a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that crimes so public and heinous might not pass unpunished.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Do, therefore, according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a> in peace. <span class="stiki"><strong>To hell...</strong> This word <em>hell</em> doth not here signify the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">place or state of damnation</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">place and state of the dead</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But show kindness to the sons of Berzellai, the Galaadite, and let them eat at thy table: for they met me when I fled from the face of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, thy brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thou hast also with thee Semei, the son of Gera, the son of Jemini, of Bahurim, who <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> me with a grievous <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, when I went to the camp: but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to him by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: I will not kill thee with the sword:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and knowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the days that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> reigned in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, were forty years: in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> he reigned seven years, in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> thirty-three.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> sat upon the throne of his father <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/07106a.htm">Haggith</a>, came to Bethsabee the mother of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>. And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? He answered: It is peaceable.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him: Speak. And he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had preferred me to be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is become my brother's: for it was appointed him by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now therefore, I ask one petition of thee; turn not away my face. And she said to him: Say on.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said I pray thee speak to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> (for he cannot deny thee any thing) to give me Abisag, the Sunamitess, to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then Bethsabee came to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>, to speak to him for <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>: and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee; do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother ask, for I must not turn away thy face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And she said: Let Abisag, the Sunamitess, be given to <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>, thy brother, to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag, the Sunamitess, for <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>? ask for him also the kingdom; for he is my elder brother, and hath <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Joab, the son of Sarvia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: So and so may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do to me, and add more, if <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> hath not spoken this word against his own life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And now, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, who hath established me, and placed me upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my father, and who hath made me a house, as he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>, <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a> shall be put to death this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> sent by the hand of <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>, who slew him, and he died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the king said also to <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: Go to <a href="../cathen/01457a.htm">Anathoth</a>, to thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my father, and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my father endured.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> So <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> from being the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> in Silo.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after <a href="../cathen/01146b.htm">Adonias</a>, and had not turned after <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: and Joab fled into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and took hold on the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horn of the altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>, that Joab was fled into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and was by the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: and <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> sent <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>, saying. Go, kill him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said to him: Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said: I will not come forth, but here I will die. <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a> brought word back to the king, saying: Thus saith Joab, and thus he answered me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the king said to him: Do as he hath said; and kill him, and bury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab, from me, and from the house of my father:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall return his blood upon his own head; because he murdered two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and better than himself: and slew them with the sword, my father, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, not knowing it; <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, the son of Ner, general of the army of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Amasa, the son of Jether general of the army of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever. But to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his seed, and his house, and to his throne, be peace for ever from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> So <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>, went up, and setting upon him slew him, and he was buried in his house in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the king appointed <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a> in his room over the army; and Sadoc, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he put in the place of <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him: Build thee a house in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and dwell there: and go not out from thence any where.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the <a href="../cathen/03475c.htm">brook Cedron</a>, know that thou shalt be put to death: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And Semei said to the king: The saying is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> many days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis, the son of Maacha, the king of Geth: and it was told Semei that his servants were gone to Geth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis, to Geth, to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, that Semei had gone from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to Geth, and was come back.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest to thee by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt go out and walk abroad any where, know that thou shalt die? And thou answeredst me: The word that I have heard is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Why then hast thou not kept the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the commandment that I laid upon thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And the king said to Semei: Thou knowest all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my father: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath returned thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> upon thy own head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, and the throne of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> shall be established before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> So the king commanded <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias, the son of Joiada</a>: and he went out and struck him; and he died.</span></p>
