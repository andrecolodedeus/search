<h1>1 Kings Chapter 20</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Syrians besiege Samaria: they are twice defeated by Achab: who is reprehended by a prophet for letting Benadad go.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Benadad, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, gathered together all his host, and there were two and thirty kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and going up, he fought against <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and besieged it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And sending messengers to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, into the city,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He said: Thus saith Benadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine: and thy wives and thy goodliest children are mine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> answered: According to thy word, my lord, O king, I am thine, and all that I have.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the messengers came again, and said: Thus saith Benadad, who sent us unto thee: Thy silver and thy gold, and thy wives and thy children, thou shalt deliver up to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> To morrow, therefore, at this same hour, I will send my servants to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants: and all that pleaseth them, they shall put in their hands, and take away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> called all the ancients of the land, and said: Mark, and see that he layeth snares for us. For he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver and gold: and I said not nay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And all the ancients, and all the people said to him: Hearken not to him, nor consent to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Wherefore he answered the messengers of Benadad: Tell my lord, the king: All that thou didst send for to me, thy servant at first, I will do: but this thing I cannot do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the messengers returning brought him word. And he sent again, and said: Such and such things may the gods do to me, and more may they add, if the dust of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> answering, said: Tell him: Let not the girded boast himself as the ungirded. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let not the girded, etc...</strong> Let him not boast before the victory: it will then be time to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> when he putteth off his armour, having overcome his adversary.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it came to pass, when Benadad heard this word, that he and the kings were drinking in pavilions, and he said to his servants: Beset the city. And they beset it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And behold a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> coming to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, said to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Hast thou seen all this exceeding great multitude? behold I will deliver them into thy hand this day: that thou mayst know that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> said: By whom? And he said to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: By the servants of the princes of the provinces. And he said: Who shall begin to fight? And he said: Thou.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So he mustered the servants of the princes of the provinces, and he found the number of two hundred and thirty-two: and he mustered after them the people, all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, seven thousand:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they went out at noon. But Benadad was drinking himself drunk in his pavilion, and the two and thirty kings with him, who were come to help him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first. And Benadad sent. And they told him, saying: There are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> come out of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said: Whether they come for peace, take them alive: or whether they come to fight, take them alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> So the servants of the princes of the provinces went out, and the rest of the army followed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And every one slew the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that came against him: and the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> fled, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> pursued after them. And Benadad, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, fled away on horseback with his horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> going out overthrew the horses and chariots, and slew the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> with a great slaughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> (And a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> coming to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, said to him: Go, and strengthen thyself, and know, and see what thou dost: for the next year the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> will come up against thee.)</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But the servants of the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> said to him: Their gods are gods of the hills, therefore they have overcome us: but it is better that we should fight against them in the plains, and we shall overcome them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Do thou, therefore, this thing: Remove all the kings from thy army, and put <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> in their stead:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And make up the number of soldiers that have been slain of thine, and horses, according to the former horses, and chariots, according to the chariots which thou hadst before: and we will fight against them in the plains, and thou shalt see that we shall overcome them. He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> their counsel, and did so.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Wherefore, at the return of the year, Benadad mustered the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, and went up to Aphec, to fight against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> were mustered, and taking victuals, went out on the other side, and encamped over against them, like two little flocks of goats: but the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> filled the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> (And a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> coming, said to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Because the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> have said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the hills, but is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the valleys: I will deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and you shall know that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And both sides set their armies in array one against the other seven days, and on the seventh day the battle was fought: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> slew, of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, a hundred thousand footmen in one day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they that remained fled to Aphec, into the city: and the wall fell upon seven and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that were left. And Benadad fleeing, went into the city, into a chamber that was within a chamber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And his servants said to him: Behold, we have heard that the kings of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> are merciful; so let us put <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloths</a> on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: perhaps he will save our lives.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> So they girded <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloths</a> on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and said to him: Thy servant, Benadad, saith: I beseech thee let me have my life. And he said: If he be yet alive, he is my brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> took this for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> luck: and in haste caught the word out of his mouth, and said: Thy brother Benadad. And he said to them: Go, and bring him to me. Then Benadad came out to him, and he lifted him up into his chariot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he said to him: The cities which my father took from thy father, I will restore: and do thou make thee streets in <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, as my father made in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and having made a league, I will depart from thee. So he made a league with him, and let him go.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Then a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, said to his companion, in the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>: Strike me. But he would not strike.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Then he said to him: Because thou wouldst not hearken to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, behold thou shalt depart from me, and a lion shall slay thee. And when he was gone a little from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Then he found another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and said to him: Strike me. And he struck him and wounded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> So the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> went, and met the king in the way, and disguised himself by sprinkling dust on his face and his eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And as the king passed by, he cried to the king, and said: Thy servant went out to fight hand to hand: and when a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was run away, one brought him to me, and said: Keep this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and if he shall slip away, thy life shall be for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And whilst I, in the hurry, turned this way and that, on a sudden he was not to be seen. And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to him: This is thy judgment, which thyself hast decreed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But he forthwith wiped off the dust from his face, and the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> knew him, that he was one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And he said to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> worthy of death, thy life shall be for his life, and thy people for his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> returned to his house, slighting to hear, and raging came into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span></p>
