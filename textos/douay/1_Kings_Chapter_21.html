<div class="h1a">Kaboth, for denying his vineyard to King Achab, is by Jezabel's commandment, falsely accused and stoned to death. For which crime Elias denounces to Achab the judgments of God: upon his humbling himself the sentence is mitigated.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after these things, Naboth the Jezrahelite, who was in Jezrahel, had at that time a vineyard, near the palace of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> spoke to Naboth, saying: Give me thy vineyard, that I may make me a garden of herbs, because it is nigh, and adjoining to my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard: or if thou think it more convenient for thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Naboth answered him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be merciful to me, and not let me give thee the inheritance of my fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> came into his house <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and fretting, because of the word that Naboth, the Jezrahelite, had spoken to him, saying: I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And casting himself upon his bed, he turned away his face to the wall, and would eat no bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, his wife, went in to him, and said to him: What is the matter that thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is so grieved? and why eatest thou no bread?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he answered her: I spoke to Naboth, the Jezrahelite, and said to him: Give me thy vineyard, and take money for it: or if it please thee, I will give thee a better vineyard for it. And he said: I will not give thee my vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, his wife, said to him. Thou art of great authority indeed, and governest well the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Arise, and eat bread, and be of good cheer; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So she wrote <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> in <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab's</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and sealed them with his ring, and sent them to the ancients, and the chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And this was the tenor of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>: Proclaim a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>, and make Naboth sit among the chief of the people;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And suborn two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, sons of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>, against him and let them bear false witness; that he hath <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the king: and then carry him out, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> him, and so let him die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of his city, the ancients and nobles, that dwelt with him in the city, did as <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> had commanded them, and as it was written in the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> which she had sent to them;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They proclaimed a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>, and made Naboth sit among the chief of the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And bringing two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, sons of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, they made them sit against him: and they, like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, bore witness against him before the people: saying: Naboth hath <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the king. Wherefore they brought him forth without the city, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned him to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they sent to <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, saying: Naboth is <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, and is dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it came to pass, when <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> heard that Naboth was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, and dead, that she said to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>: Arise, and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, who would not agree with thee, and give it thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> heard this, to wit, that Naboth was dead, he arose, and went down into the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, to take possession of it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, the Thesbite, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Arise, and go down to meet <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who is in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: behold he is going down to the vineyard of Naboth, to take possession of it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Thou hast slain: moreover also thou hast taken possession. And after these words thou shalt add: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: In this place, wherein the dogs have licked the blood of Naboth, they shall lick thy blood also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> said to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>: Hast thou found me thy enemy? He said: I have found thee because thou art sold, to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Sold, to do evil in the sight, etc...</strong> That is, so addicted to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as if thou hadst sold thyself to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to be his slave to work all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Behold I will bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon thee, and I will cut down thy posterity, and I will kill of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the last in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And I will make thy house like the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> the son of Nabat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahias: for what thou hast done to provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and for making <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> also, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke, saying: The dogs shall eat <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> in the field of Jezrahel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> If <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field, the birds of the air shall eat him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Now, there was not such another as <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, who was sold to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for his wife, <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, set him on,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he became abominable, insomuch that he followed the idols which the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a> had made, whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed before the face of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> had heard these words, he rent his garments, and put haircloth upon his flesh, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a>, and slept in <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, and walked with his head cast down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, the Thesbite, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Hast thou not seen <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> before me? therefore, because he hath <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> himself, for my sake, I will not bring the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his days, but in his son's days will I bring the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon his house.</span></p>
