<div class="h1a">Achab believing his false prophets, rather than Micheas, is slain in Ramoth Gilead. Ochozias succeeds him. Good King Josaphat dies, and his son Joram succeeds him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And there passed three years without <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And in the third year, Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, came down to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> (And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to his servants: Know ye not that Ramoth Galaad is ours, and we neglect to take it out of the hand of the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>?)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he said to Josaphat: Wilt thou come with me to battle to Ramoth Galaad?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Josaphat said to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: As I am, so art thou: my people and thy people are one: and my horsemen are thy horsemen. And Josaphat said to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Inquire, I beseech thee, this day the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> assembled the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, about four hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and he said to them: Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or shall I forbear? They answered: Go up, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will deliver it into the hand of the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Josaphat said: Is there not here some <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that we may inquire by him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to Josaphat. There is one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> left, by whom we may inquire of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah, the son of Jemla</a>: but I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him, for he doth not <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And Josaphat said: Speak not so, O king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> called an eunuch, and said to him: Make haste, and bring hither <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah, the son of Jemla</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, sat each on his throne, clothed with royal robes, in a <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, by the entrance of the gate of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Sedecias, the son of Chanaana, made himself horns of iron, and said: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: With these shalt thou push <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, till thou destroy it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> in like manner, saying: Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and prosper, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will deliver it into the king's hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the messenger that went to call <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a>, spoke to him, saying: Behold the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with one mouth declare <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to the king: let thy word, therefore, be like to theirs, and speak that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> said to him: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall say to me, that will I speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So he came to the king, and the king said to him: <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a>, shall we go to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall we forbear? He answered him: Go up, and prosper, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall deliver it into the king's hands. <span class="stiki"><strong>Go up, etc...</strong> This was spoken ironically, and by way of jesting at the flattering speeches of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and so the king understood it, as appears by his <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuring</a> <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a>, in the following verse, to tell him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But the king said to him: I adjure thee again and again, that thou tell me nothing but that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said: I saw all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> scattered upon the hills, like sheep that have no shepherd; and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: These have no master: let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of them return to his house in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> (Then the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to Josaphat: Did I not tell thee, that he <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesieth</a> no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me, but always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he added and said: Hear thou, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>: I saw the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sitting on his throne, and all the army of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> standing by him on the right hand and on the left:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Who shall deceive <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that he may go up, and fall at Ramoth Galaad? And one spoke words of this manner, and another otherwise. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Lord said, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> standeth not in need of any counsellor; nor are we to suppose that things pass in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in the manner here described: but this representation was made to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, to be delivered by him in a manner adapted to the common ways and notions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: I will deceive him. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: By what means?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said: I will go forth, and be a lying spirit, in the mouth of all his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Thou shalt deceive him, and shalt prevail: go forth, and do so. <span class="stiki"><strong>Go forth, and do so...</strong> This was not a command, but a permission: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> never ordaineth <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lies</a>; though he often permitteth the <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> spirit to deceive those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <a href="../douay/2th002.htm#verse10">2 Thessalonians 2:10</a>. And in this sense it is said in the following verse, The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> spirit in the mouth of all thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now, therefore, behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given a lying spirit in the mouth of all thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that are here, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Sedecias, the son of Chanaana, came, and struck <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> on the cheek, and said: Hath then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a> left me, and spoken to thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> said: Thou shalt see in the day when thou shalt go into a chamber within a chamber to hide thyself. <span class="stiki"><strong>Go into a chamber, etc...</strong> This happened when he heard the king was slain, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> apprehended that he should be punished for his <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said: Take <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> and let him abide with Amon, the governor of the city, and with Joas, the son of Amalech;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And tell them: Thus saith the king: Put this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction, and water of distress till I return in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> said: If thou return in peace, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath not spoken by me. And he said: Hear, all ye people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, went up to Ramoth-Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to Josaphat: Take thy armour, and go into the battle, and put on thy own garments. But the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> changed his dress, and went into the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> had commanded the two and thirty <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the chariots, saying: You shall not fight against any, small or great, but against the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> only.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> So when the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the chariots saw Josaphat, they suspected that he was the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and making a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> assault, they fought against him: and Josaphat cried out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the chariots perceived that he was not the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they turned away from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bent his bow, shooting at a venture, and chanced to strike the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, between the lungs and the stomach. But he said to the driver of his chariot: Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army, for I am grievously wounded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the battle was fought that day, and the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> stood in his chariot against the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, and he died in the evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the herald proclaimed through all the army, before the sun set, saying: Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> return to his own city, and to his own country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And the king died, and was carried into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: and they buried the king in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And they washed his chariot in the <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and the dogs licked up his blood, and they washed the reins according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> which he had spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, and all that he did, and the house of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> that he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> So <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> slept with his fathers; and Ochozias, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But Josaphat, the son of Asa, began to reign over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, in the fourth year of Acbab, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> He was five and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned five and twenty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Azuba, the daughter of Salai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And he walked in all the way of Asa, his father, and he declined not from it: and he did that which was right in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Nevertheless, he took not away the high places for as yet the people offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the high places. <span class="stiki"><strong>He took not away, etc...</strong> He left some of the high places, viz., those in which they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipped</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but took away all others, <a href="../douay/2ch017.htm#verse6">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>, and note <a href="../douay/1ki015.htm#verse14">1 Kings 15:14</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And Josaphat had peace with the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> But the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and his works which he did, and his battles, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And the remnant also of the effeminate, who remained in the days of Asa, his father, he took out of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And there was then no king appointed in <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> But king Josaphat made navies on the sea, to sail into <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a> for gold: but they could not go, for the ships were broken in <a href="../cathen/01792a.htm">Asiongaber</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Then Ochozias, the son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, said to Josaphat: Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. And Josaphat would not. <span class="stiki"><strong>Would not...</strong> He had been reprehended before for admitting such a partner: and therefore would have no more to do with him.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, his father: and Joram, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
