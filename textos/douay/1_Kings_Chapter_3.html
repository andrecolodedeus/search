<div class="h1a">Solomon marries Pharao's daughter. He sacrifices in Gabaon: in the choice which God gave him he prefers wisdom. His wise judgment between the two harlots.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the kingdom was established in the hand of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and he made affinity with <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: for he took his daughter, and brought her into the city of David: until he had made an end of building his own house, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the wall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But yet the people <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in the high places: for there was no <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> built to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> until that day. <span class="stiki"><strong>High places...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> where they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipped</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but not according to the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>; which allowed of no other places for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> but the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>. Among these high places that of Gabaon was the chiefest, because there was the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>, which had been removed from Silo to Nobe and from Nobe to Gabaon.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, walking in the precepts of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father; only he <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in the high places, and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He went therefore to Gabaon, to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> there: for that was the great high place: a thousand victims for <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, did <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> offer upon that <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, in Gabaon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> in a dream by night, saying: Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> said: Thou hast showed great mercy to thy servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my father, even as he walked before thee in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and an upright heart with thee: and thou hast kept thy great mercy for him, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And now, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, thou hast made thy servant king instead of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my father: and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and come in;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And thy servant is in the midst of the people which thou hast chosen, an immense people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people, and discern between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For who shall be able to judge this people, thy people, which is so numerous?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the word was pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had asked such a thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life nor riches, nor the lives of thy enemies, but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern judgment;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and have given thee a wise and understanding heart, in so much that there hath been no one like thee before thee, nor shall arise after thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Yea, and the things also which thou didst not ask, I have given thee; to wit, riches and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: so that no one hath been like thee among the kings in all days heretofore.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And if thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts and my commandments, as thy father walked, I will lengthen thy days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> awaked, and perceived that it was a dream: and when he was come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he stood before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>, and offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> victims of peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, and made a great feast for all his servants.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then there came two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And one of them said: I beseech thee, my lord, I and this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> dwelt in one house, and I was delivered of a child with her in the chamber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the third day after I was delivered, she also was delivered; and we were together, and no other person with us in the house; only we two.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> child died in the night: for in her sleep she overlaid him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And rising in the dead time of the night, she took my child from my side, while I, thy handmaid, was asleep, and laid it in her bosom: and laid her dead child in my bosom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when I arose in the morning, to give my child suck, behold it was dead: but considering him more diligently, when it was clear day, I found that it was not mine which I bore.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> answered: It is not so as thou sayst, but thy child is dead, and mine is alive. On the contrary, she said; Thou liest: for my child liveth, and thy child is dead. And in this manner they strove before the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then said the king: The one saith, My child is alive, and thy child is dead. And the other answereth: Nay; but thy child is dead, and mine liveth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The king therefore said: Bring me a sword. And when they had brought a sword before the king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Divide, said he, the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whose child was alive, said to the king; (for her bowels were moved upon her child) I beseech thee, my lord, give her the child alive, and do not kill it. But the other said: Let it be neither mine nor thine; but divide it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> The king answered, and said: Give the living child to this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and let it not be killed; for she is the mother thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> heard the judgment which the king had judged, and they feared the king, seeing that the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in him to do judgment.</span></p>
