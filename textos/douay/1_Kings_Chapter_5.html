<h1>1 Kings Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">Hiram king of Tyre agrees to furnish timber and workmen for building the temple: the number of workmen and overseers.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Hiram, king of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, sent his servants to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: for he heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram had always been <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> friend.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> sent to Hiram, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thou knowest the will of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my father, and that he could not build a house to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because of the wars that were round about him, until the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> put them under the soles of his feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given me rest round about; and there is no adversary nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> occurrence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Wherefore I purpose to build a <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon the throne, in thy place, he shall build a house to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Give orders, therefore, that thy servants cut me down <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar trees</a>, out of Libanus, and let my servants be with thy servants: and I will give thee the hire of thy servants whatsoever thou wilt ask: for thou knowest how there is not among my people a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that has skill to hew wood like to the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now when Hiram had heard the words of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, he rejoiced exceedingly, and said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> this day, who hath given to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> a very wise son over this numerous people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Hiram sent to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, saying: I have heard all thou hast desired of me; and I will do all thy desire concerning <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar trees</a>, and fir trees.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> My servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: and I will put them together in floats, on the sea, and convey them to the place, which thou shalt signify to me, and will land them there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt allow me necessaries to furnish food for my household.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So Hiram gave <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar trees</a>, and fir trees, according to all his desire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> allowed Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat, for provision for his house, and twenty measures of the purest oil: thus gave <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> to Hiram every year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave wisdom to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, as he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> him: and there was peace between Hiram and <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and they two made a league together.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> chose workmen out of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the levy was of thirty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand every month, by turns, so that two months they were at home: and Adoniram was over this levy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had seventy thousand to carry burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountain:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Besides the overseers who were over every work, in number three thousand and three hundred, that ruled over the people, and them that did the work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the king commanded that they should bring great stones, costly stones, for the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and should square them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the masons of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and the masons of Hiram, hewed them: and the Giblians prepared timber and stones to build the house.</span></p>
