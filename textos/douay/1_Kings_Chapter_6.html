<div class="h1a">The building of Solomon's temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> came out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the fourth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in the month Zio, (the same is the second month) he began to build a house to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the house, which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> built to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, was threescore cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And there was a porch before the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, of twenty cubits in length, according to the measure of the breadth of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and it was ten cubits in breadth, before the face of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he made in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> oblique windows.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And upon the wall of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, he built floors round about, in the walls of the house, round about the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and the oracle, and he made chambers in the sides round about. <span class="stiki"><strong>Upon the wall, i.e., joining to the wall. -- Ibid. He built floors round about...</strong> Chambers or cells adjoining to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, for the use of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, so contrived as to be between the inward and outward wall of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, in three stories, one above another. -- Ibid. <strong>The oracle...</strong> The inner <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> or holy of holies, where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave his <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracles</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The floor that was underneath was five cubits in breadth, and the middle floor was six cubits in breadth, and the third floor was seven cubits in breadth. And he put beams in the house round about on the outside, that they might not be fastened in the walls of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the house, when it was in building, was built of stones, hewed and made ready: so that there was neither hammer nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the house when it was in building. <span class="stiki"><strong>Made ready, etc...</strong> So the stones for the building of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> eternal <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, (who are the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>), must first be hewn and polished here by many trials and sufferings, before they can be admitted to have a place in that celestial structure.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The door, for the middle side, was on the right hand of the house: and by winding stairs they went up to the middle room, and from the middle to the third.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So he built the house, and finished it: and he covered the house with roofs of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he built a floor over all the house, five cubits in height, and he covered the house with timber of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> As for this house, which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments, walking in them, I will fulfil my word to thee, which I spoke to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> thy father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I will dwell in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and I will not forsake my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> built the house, and finished it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he built the walls of the house on the inside, with boards of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>, from the floor of the house to the top of the walls, and to the roofs, he covered it with boards of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a> on the inside: and he covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he built up twenty cubits with boards of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a> at the hinder part of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, from the floor to the top: and made the inner house of the oracle to be the holy of holies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> itself, before the doors of the oracle, was forty cubits long.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And all the house was covered within with <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>, having the turnings, and the joints thereof artfully wrought, and carvings projecting out: all was covered with boards of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>: and no stone could be seen in the wall at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he made the oracle in the midst of the house, in the inner part, to set there the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in height. And he covered it, and overlaid it with most pure gold. And the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> also he covered with <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the house before the oracle he overlaid with most pure gold, and fastened on the plates with nails of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And there was nothing in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> that was not covered with gold: the whole <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the oracle he covered also with gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he made in the oracle two <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> of olive tree, of ten cubits in height.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> One wing of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> was five cubits, and the other wing of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> was five cubits: that is, in all ten cubits, from the extremity of one wing to the extremity of the other wing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The second <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> also was ten cubits: and the measure, and the work was the same in both the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> That is to say, one <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> was ten cubits high, and in like manner the other <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he set the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> in the midst of the inner <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> stretched forth their wings, and the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> touched the other wall: and the other wings in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> touched one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he overlaid the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> with gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And all the walls of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> round about he carved with divers figures and carvings: and he made in them <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> and palm trees, and divers representations, as it were standing out, and coming forth from the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the floor of the house he also overlaid with gold within and without.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And in the entrance of the oracle, he made little doors of olive tree, and posts of five corners,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And two doors of olive tree: and he carved upon them figures of <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>, and figures of palm trees, and carvings very much projecting; and he overlaid them with gold: and he covered both the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> and the palm trees, and the other things, with gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he made in the entrance of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> posts of olive tree foursquare:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And two doors of fir tree, one of each side: and each door was double, and so opened with folding leaves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he carved <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>, and palm trees, and carved work standing very much out: and he overlaid all with golden plates in square work by rule.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he built the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> with three rows of polished stones, and one row of beams of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> In the fourth year was the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> founded, in the month Zio:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul. (which is the eighth month) the house was finished in all the works thereof, and in all the appurtenances thereof: and he was seven years in building it.</span></p>
