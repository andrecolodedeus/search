<h1>1 Kings Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">Solomon's palace, his house in the forest, and the queen's house: the work of the two pillars: the sea (or laver) and other vessels.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> built his own house in thirteen years, and brought it to perfection.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He built also the house of the forest of Libanus; the length of it was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits: and four galleries between pillars of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>: for he had cut <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar trees</a> into pillars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he covered the whole vault with boards of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>, and it was held up with five and forty pillars. And one row had fifteen pillars,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Set one against another,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And looking one upon another, with equal space between the pillars, and over the pillars were square beams in all things equal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he made a porch of pillars of fifty cubits in length, and thirty cubits in breadth: and another porch before the greater porch, and pillars, and chapiters upon the pillars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He made also the porch of the throne wherein is the seat of judgment; and covered it with <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar wood</a> from the floor to the top.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And in the midst of the porch, was a small house, where he sat in judgment of the like work. He made also a house for the daughter of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> (whom <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had taken to wife) of the same work, as this porch;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and measure, both within and without: from the foundation to the top of the walls, and without, unto the great <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones of ten cubits or eight cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And above there were costly stones of equal measure hewed, and in like manner planks of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the great <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> was made round with three rows of hewed stones, and one row of planks of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>, which also was observed in the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and in the porch of the house.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> sent, and brought Hiram from <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The son of a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow woman</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">tribe of Nephthali</a>, whose father was a Tyrian, an artificer in brass, and full of wisdom, and understanding, and skill to work all work in brass. And when he was come to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>, he wrought all his work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he cast two pillars in brass, each pillar was eighteen cubits high: and a line of twelve cubits compassed both the pillars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He made also two chapiters of molten brass, to be set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And a kind of network, and chain work wreathed together with wonderful art. Both the chapiters of the pillars were cast: seven rows of nets were on one chapiter, and seven nets on the other chapiter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he made the pillars, and two rows round about each network to cover the chapiters, that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and in like manner did he to the other chapiter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of lily work, in the porch of four cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And again there were other chapiters on the top of the pillars above, according to the measure of the pillar over against the network: and of pomegranates there were two hundred, in rows round about the other chapiter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he set up the two pillars in the porch of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and when he had set up the pillar on the right hand, he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof Jachin: in like manner he set up the second pillar, and called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof Booz. <span class="stiki"><strong>Jachin...</strong> That is, firmly established. -- Ibid. <strong>Booz...</strong> That is, in its strength. By recording these <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">holy writ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a> would have us understand the invincible firmness and strength of the pillars on which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, is established.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And upon the tops of the pillars he made lily work: so the work of the pillars was finished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> He made also a molten sea, of ten cubits, from brim to brim, round all about; the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And a graven work, under the brim of it, compassed it for ten cubits going about the sea: there were two rows cast of chamfered sculptures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And it stood upon twelve oxen, of which three looked towards the north, and three towards the west, and three towards the south, and three towards the east: and the sea was above upon them, and their hinder parts were all hid within.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the laver was a hand breadth thick: and the brim thereof was like the brim of a cup, or the leaf of a crisped lily: it contained two thousand bates. <span class="stiki"><strong>Two thousand bates...</strong> That is, about ten thousand gallons. This was the quantity of water which was usually put into it: but it was capable, if brimful, of holding three thousand. See <a href="../douay/2ch004.htm#verse5">2 Chronicles 4:5</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he made ten bases of brass, every base was four cubits in length, and four cubits in breadth, and three cubits high.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the work itself of the bases, was intergraven: and there were gravings between the joinings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And between the little crowns and the ledges, were lions, and oxen, and <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>; and in the joinings likewise above: and under the lions and oxen, as it were bands of brass hanging down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And every base had four wheels, and axletrees of brass: and at the four sides were undersetters, under the laver molten, looking one against another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> The mouth also of the laver within, was in the top of the chapiter: and that which appeared without, was of one cubit all round, and together it was one cubit and a half: and in the corners of the pillars were divers engravings: and the spaces between the pillars were square, not round.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base, were joined one to another under the base: the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they were such wheels as are used to be made in a chariot: and their axletrees, and spokes, and strakes, and naves, were all cast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the four undersetters, that were at every corner of each base, were of the base itself, cast and joined together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And on the top of the base, there was a round compass of half a cubit, so wrought that the laver might be set thereon, having its gravings, and divers sculptures of itself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> He engraved also in those plates, which were of brass, and in the corners, <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>, and lions, and palm trees, in likeness of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> standing, so that they seemed not to be engraven, but added round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> After this manner, he made ten bases, of one casting and measure, and the like graving.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> He made also ten lavers of brass: one laver contained four bates, and was of four cubits: and upon every base, in all ten, he put as many lavers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he set the ten bases, five on the right side of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and five on the left: and the sea he put on the right side of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, over against the east southward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And Hiram made cauldrons, and shovels, and basins, and finished all the work of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> The two pillars and the two cords of the chapiters, upon the chapiters of the pillars: and the two networks, to cover the two cords, that were upon the top of the pillars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks: two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the cords of the chapiters, which were upon the tops of the pillars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And the cauldrons, and the shovels, and the basins. All the vessels that Hiram made for <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, were of fine brass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> In the plains of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, did the king cast them in a clay ground, between Socoth and Sartham.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> placed all the vessels: but for its exceeding great multitude the brass could not be weighed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> made all the vessels for the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of gold, and the table of gold, upon which the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">loaves of proposition</a> should be set:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And the golden candlesticks, five on the right hand, and five on the left, over against the oracle, of pure gold: and the flowers like lilies, and the lamps over them of gold: and golden snuffers,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And pots, and fleshhooks, and bowls, and mortars, and <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, of most pure gold: and the hinges for the doors of the inner house of the holy of holies, and for the doors of the house of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, were of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> finished all the work that he made in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and brought in the things that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father, had <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a>, the silver and the gold, and the vessels, and laid them up in the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span></p>
