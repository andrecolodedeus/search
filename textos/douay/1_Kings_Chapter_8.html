<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And it came to pass, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were come out of the sanctuary, that a cloud filled the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my father, would have built a house to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my father: Whereas, thou hast thought in thy heart to build a house to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, thou hast done well in having this same thing in thy mind.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath performed his word which he spoke.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And I have set there a place for the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, wherein is the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he made with our fathers, when they came out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> stood before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, in the sight of the assembly of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and spread forth his hands towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>,</span>
