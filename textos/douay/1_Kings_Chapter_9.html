<div class="h1a">The Lord appears again to Solomon: he builds cities: he sends a fleet to Ophir.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass when <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had finished the building of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the king's house, and all that he desired and was pleased to do,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> That the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared to him the second time, as he had appeared to him in Gabaon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: I have heard thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and thy supplication, which thou hast made before me: I have <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> this house, which thou hast built, to put my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> there for ever; and my eyes, and my heart, shall be there always.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And if thou wilt walk before me, as thy father walked, in simplicity of heart, and in uprightness: and wilt do all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my ordinances, and my judgments, <span class="stiki"><strong>As thy father walked, in simplicity of heart...</strong> That is, in the sincerity and integrity of a single heart, as opposite to all double dealing and deceit.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for ever, as I <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, thy father, saying: There shall not fail a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of thy race upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But if you and your children, revolting, shall turn away from following me, and will not keep my commandments, and my <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, which I have set before you, but will go and worship strange gods, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> I will take away <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the face of the land which I have given them; and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> which I have <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, I will cast out of my sight; and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be a proverb, and a byword among all people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And this house shall be made an example of: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss, and say: Why hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> done thus to this land, and to this house?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they shall answer: Because they forsook the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who brought their fathers out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and followed strange gods, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> them, and worshipped them: therefore hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> brought upon them all this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when twenty years were ended, after <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had built the two houses; that is, the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the house of the king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> (Hiram, the king of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, furnishing <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> with <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar trees</a>, and fir trees, and gold, according to all he had need of) then <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> gave Hiram twenty cities in the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">land of Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Hiram came out of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, to see the towns which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had given him, and they pleased him not;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he said: Are these the cities which thou hast given me, brother? And he called them the land of Chabul, unto this day. <span class="stiki"><strong>Chabul...</strong> That is, dirty or displeasing.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Hiram sent to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> a hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> This is the sum of the expenses, which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> offered to build the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and his own house, and Mello, and the wall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and Heser, and <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a>, and Gazer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, came up and took Gazer, and burnt it with fire: and slew the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> that dwelt in the city, and gave it for a dowry to his daughter, <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a> wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> built Gazer, and Bethhoron the nether,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Baalath, and Palmira, in the land of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And all the towns that belonged to himself, and were not walled, he fortified; the cities also of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and whatsoever he had a mind to build in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and in Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> All the people that were left of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethites</a>, and Pherezites, and Hevites, and Jebusites, that are not of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Their children, that were left in the land; to wit, such as the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> had not been able to destroy, <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> made tributary unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> made not any to be bondmen, but they were warriors, and his servants, and his princes, and <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, and overseers of the chariots and horses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And there were five hundred and fifty chief officers set over all the works of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and they had people under them, and had charge over the appointed works.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the daughter of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> came up out of the city of David to her house, which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had built for her: then did he build Mello.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> also offered three times every year <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and victims of peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> which he had built to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was finished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> made a fleet in <a href="../cathen/01792a.htm">Asiongaber</a>, which is by Ailath, on the shore of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">land of Edom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Hiram sent his servants in the fleet, sailors that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they came to <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a>; and they brought from thence to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> four hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span></p>
