<h1>1 Maccabees</h1>

<p>These books are so called, because they contain the history of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">people of God</a> under the command of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a> and his brethren: and he, as some will have it, was surnamed <em>Machabeus</em>, from carrying in his ensigns, or standards, those words of <a href="../douay/exo015.htm#verse11">Exodus 15:11</a>, <em>Who is like to thee among the strong, O Lord</em>: in which the initial letters, in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, are M.C.B.E.I. It is not known who is the author of these books. But as to their authority, though they are not received by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, saith <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, (lib. 18, De Civ. Dei, c. 36), they are received by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>: who, in settling her <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">canon of the scriptures</a>, chose rather to be directed by the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> she had received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles of Christ</a>, than by that of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. And as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has declared these two books <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">canonical</a>, even in two <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, viz., <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Florence</a> and <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of their <a href="../cathen/02137b.htm">authenticity</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/09495a.htm">BOOKS OF MACHABEES</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)
