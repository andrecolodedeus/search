<h1>1 Maccabees Chapter 1</h1>
<div class="h1a">The reign of Alexander and his successors: Antiochus rifles and profanes the temple of God: and persecutes unto death all that will not forsake the law of God, and the religion of their fathers.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now it came to pass, after that Alexander the son of Philip the Macedonian, who first reigned in Greece, coming out of the land of Cethim, had overthrown Darius, king of the Persians and <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He fought many battles, and took the strong holds of all, and slew the kings of the earth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he went through even to the ends of the earth: and took the spoils of many nations: and the earth was quiet before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he gathered a power, and a very strong army: and his heart was exalted and lifted up:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he subdued countries of nations, and princes; and they became tributaries to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And after these things, he fell down upon his bed, and knew that he should die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he called his servants, the nobles that were brought up with him from his youth: and he divided his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive. <span class="stiki"><strong>Divided his kingdom, etc...</strong> This is otherwise related by Q. Curtius; though he acknowledges that divers were of that opinion, and that it had been delivered by some authors, lib. 10. But here we find from the sacred text, that he was in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Alexander reigned twelve years, and he died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And his servants made themselves kings, every one in his place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they all put crowns upon themselves after his death, and their sons after them, many years; and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> were multiplied in the earth.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And there came out of them a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> root, Antiochus the Illustrious, the son of king Antiochus, who had been a hostage at Rome: and he reigned in the hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks. <span class="stiki"><strong>Antiochus the Illustrius...</strong> Epiphanes, the younger son of Antiochus the Great, who usurped the kingdom, to the prejudice of his nephew Demetrius, son of his elder brother Seleucus Philopater. -- Ibid. <strong>Of the kingdom of the Greeks...</strong> Counting, not from the beginning of the reign of Alexander, but from the first year of Seleucus Nicator.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> In those days there went out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they persuaded many, saying: Let us go and make a covenant with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> that are round about us: for since we departed from them, many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> have befallen us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the word seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in their eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And some of the people determined to do this, and went to the king: and he gave them license to do after the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they built a place of exercise in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, according to the laws of the nations:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they made themselves prepuces, and departed from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> covenant, and joined themselves to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, and were sold to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the kingdom was established before Antiochus, and he had a mind to reign over the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that he might reign over two kingdoms.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he entered into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great number of ships:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Ptolemee king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; but Ptolemee was afraid at his presence and fled, and many were wounded unto death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he took the strong cities in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and he took the spoils of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And after Antiochus had ravaged <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the hundred and forty-third year, he returned and went up against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, with a great multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a> entered into the sanctuary, and took away the golden <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof, and the table of proposition, and the pouring vessels, and the vials, and the little mortars of gold, and the veil, and the crowns, and the golden ornament that was before the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and he broke them all in pieces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he took the silver and gold, and the precious vessels: and he took the hidden treasures, which he found: and when he had taken all away, he departed into his own country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he made a great slaughter of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and spoke very <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And there was great mourning in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and in every place where they were:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the princes, and the ancients mourned, and the virgins and the young men were made feeble, and the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was changed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Every bridegroom took up lamentation: and the bride that sat in the marriage bed, mourned:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the land was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Jacob</a> was covered with confusion.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And after two full years, the king sent the chief collector of his tributes to the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and he came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with a great multitude. <span class="stiki"><strong>The chief collector, etc...</strong> Apollonius.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he spoke to them peaceable words in deceit; and they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he fell upon the city suddenly, and struck it with a great slaughter, and destroyed much people in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he took the spoils of the city, and burnt it with fire, and threw down the houses thereof, and the walls thereof round about:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And they took the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> captive, and the children, and the cattle they possessed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And they built the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with strong towers, and made it a fortress for them: <span class="stiki"><strong>The city of David...</strong> That is, the castle of Sion.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And they placed there a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> nation, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they fortified themselves therein: and they stored up armour and victuals, and gathered together the spoils of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And laid them up there: and they became a great snare.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And this was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>An evil devil...</strong> That is, an adversary watching constantly to do harm, as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> is always watching and seeking whom he may devour.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And they shed innocent blood round about the sanctuary, and defiled the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> fled away by reason of them and the city was made the habitation of strangers, and she became a stranger to her own seed, and her children forsook her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Her sanctuary was desolate like a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, her festival days were turned into mourning, her <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> into reproach, her honours were brought to nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Her dishonour was increased according to her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and her excellency was turned into mourning.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And king Antiochus wrote to all his kingdom, that all the people should be one: and every one should leave his own law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And all nations consented, according to the word of king Antiochus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And many of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> consented to his service, and they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to idols, and profaned the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And the king sent <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> by the hands of messengers to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and to all the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>; that they should follow the law of the nations of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And should forbid <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonements</a> to be made in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And should prohibit the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and the festival days to be celebrated.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And he commanded the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places to be profaned, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And he commanded <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> to be built, and temples, and idols, and swine's flesh to be immolated, and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> beasts,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And that they should leave their children uncircumcised, and let their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> be defiled with all <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleannesses</a>, and abominations, to the end that they should forget the law, and should change all the justifications of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And that whosoever would not do according to the word of king Antiochus, should be put to death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> According to all these words he wrote to his whole kingdom: and he appointed rulers over the people that should force them to do these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And they commanded the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> Then many of the people were gathered to them that had forsaken the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and they committed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> in the land:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And they drove away the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> into lurking holes, and into the secret places of fugitives.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> On the fifteenth day of the month, Casleu, in the hundred and forty-fifth year, king Antiochus set up the abominable idol of desolation upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they built <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> throughout all the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> round about: <span class="stiki"><strong>The abominable idol, etc...</strong> Viz., the statue of Jupiter Olympius.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And they burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> at the doors of the houses and in the streets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And they cut in pieces, and burnt with fire the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">books of the law of God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And every one with whom the books of the testament of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> were found, and whosoever observed the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, they put to death, according to the edict of the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> Thus by their power did they deal with the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that were found in the cities month after month.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And on the five and twentieth day of the month they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the idol that was over against the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> their children were slain according to the commandment of king Antiochus,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> And they hanged the children about their necks in all their houses: and those that had <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> them, they put to death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And many of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> determined with themselves, that they would not eat <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> things: and they chose rather to die, than to be defiled with <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> meats:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And they would not break the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and they were put to death:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> And there was very great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon the people.</span></p>
