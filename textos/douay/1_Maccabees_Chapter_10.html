<h1>1 Maccabees Chapter 10</h1>
<div class="h1a">Alexander Bales sets himself up for king: both he and Demetrius seek to make Jonathan their friend. Alexander kills Demetrius in battle, and honours Jonathan. His victory over Apollonius.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now in the hundred and sixtieth year, Alexander, the son of Antiochus, surnamed the Illustrious, came up and took <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, and they received him, and he reigned there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And king Demetrius heard of it, and gathered together an exceeding great army, and went forth against him to fight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Demetrius sent a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, with peaceable words, to magnify him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For he said: Let us first make a peace with him, before he make one with Alexander against us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For he will remember all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that we have done against him, and against his brother, and against his nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he gave him authority to gather together a army, and to make arms, and that he should be his confederate: and the hostages that were in the castle, he commanded to be delivered to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and read the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> in the hearing of all the people, and of them that were in the castle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they were struck with great fear, because they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the hostages were delivered to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and he restored them to their parents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and began to build, and to repair the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he ordered workmen to build the walls, and mount Sion round about with square stones for fortification: and so they did.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then the strangers that were in the strong holds, which Bacchides had built, fled away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> left his place, and departed into his own country:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Only in Bethsura there remained some of them, that had forsaken the law, and the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: for this was a place of refuge for them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And king Alexander heard of the promises that Demetrius had made <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>: and they told him of the battles, and the worthy acts that he and his brethren had done, and the labours that they had endured.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he said: Shall we find such another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? now, therefore, we will make him our friend and our confederate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So he wrote a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>, and sent it to him according to these words, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> King Alexander to his brother, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, greetings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> We have heard of thee, that thou art a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of great power, and fit to be our friend:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now therefore, we make thee this day <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of thy nation, and that thou be called the king's friend, (and he sent him a purple robe, and a crown of gold) and that thou be of one mind with us in our affairs, and keep friendship with us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> put on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a> in the seventh month, in the year one hundred and threescore, at the feast day of the tabernacles: and he gathered together an army, and made a great number of arms.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Demetrius heard these words, and was exceeding sorry, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> What is this that we have done, that Alexander hath prevented us to gain the friendship of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to strengthen himself?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> I also will write to them words of request, and offer dignities, and gifts: that they may be with me to aid me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he wrote to them in these words: King Demetrius to the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Whereas you have kept covenant with us, and have continued in our friendship, and have not joined with our enemies, we have heard of it, and are glad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Wherefore now continue still to keep fidelity towards us, and we will reward you with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, for what you have done in our behalf.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And we will remit to you many charges, and will give you gifts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And now I free you, and all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, from tributes, and I release you from the customs of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, and remit the crowns, and the thirds of the seed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the half of the fruit of trees, which is my share, I leave to you from this day forward, so that it shall not be taken of the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and of the three cities that are added thereto out of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, from this day forth, and for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And let <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and free, with the borders thereof: and let the tenths, and tributes be for itself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> I yield up also the power of the castle that is in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and I give it to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, to place therein such <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as he shall choose, to keep it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that hath been carried captive from the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> in all my kingdom, I set at liberty freely, that all be discharged from tributes, even of their cattle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And I will that all the feasts, and the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and the new moons, and the days appointed, and three days before the solemn day, and three days after the solemn day, be all days of immunity and freedom, for all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that are in my kingdom:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall have power to do any thing against them, or to molest any of them, in any cause.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And let there be enrolled in the king's army to the number of thirty thousand of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: and allowance shall be made them, as is due to all the king's forces and certain of them shall be appointed to be in the fortresses of the great king:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And some of them shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom, that are of trust, and let the governors be taken from among themselves, and let them walk in their own laws, as the king hath commanded in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And the three cities that are added to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, out of the country of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, let them be accounted with <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>: that they may be under one, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> no other authority but that of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a> and the confines thereof, I give as a free gift to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places that are in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, for the necessary charges of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And I give every year fifteen thousand sicles of silver out of the king's accounts, of what belongs to me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And all that is above, which they that were over the affairs the years before, had not paid, from this time they shall give it to the works of the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Moreover, the five thousand sicles of silver, which they received from the account of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, every year, shall also belong to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that execute the ministry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And whosoever shall flee into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and in all the borders thereof, being indebted to the king for any matter, let them be set at liberty, and all that they have in my kingdom, let them have it free.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> For the building also, or repairing the works of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, the charges shall be given out of the king's revenues:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> For the building also of the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the fortifying thereof round about, the charges shall be given out of the king's account, as also for the building of the walls in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and the people heard these words, they gave no credit to them, nor received them because they remembered the great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he had done in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for he had afflicted them exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And their inclinations were towards Alexander, because he had been the chief promoter of peace in their regard, and him they always helped.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And king Alexander gathered together a great army, and moved his camp near to Demetrius.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And the two kings joined battle, and the army of Demetrius fled away, and Alexander pursued after him, and pressed them close.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And the battle was hard fought, till the sun went down: and Demetrius was slain that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, with words to this effect, saying: <span class="stiki"><strong>Ptolemee...</strong> Surnamed Philometer.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Forasmuch as I am returned into my kingdom and am set in the throne of my ancestors, and have gotten the dominion, and have overthrown Demetrius and possessed our country,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And have joined battle with him, and both he and his army have been destroyed by us, and we are placed in the throne of his kingdom:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Now, therefore, let us make friendship one with another: and give me now thy daughter to wife, and I will be thy son in law, and I will give both thee and her gifts worthy of thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And king Ptolemee answered, saying: Happy is the day wherein thou didst return to the land of thy fathers, and sattest in the throne of their kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And now I will do to thee as thou hast written but meet me at <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, that we may see one another, and I may give her to thee as thou hast said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> So Ptolemee went out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, with Cleopatra his daughter, and he came to <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, in the hundred and sixty-second year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And king Alexander met him, and he gave him his daughter, Cleopatra: and he celebrated her marriage at <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a> with great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, after the manner of kings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And king Alexander wrote to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, that he should come and meet him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And he went honourably to <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, and he met there the two kings, and he gave them much silver, and gold, and presents: and he found favour in their sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And some pestilent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life, assembled themselves against him, to accuse him: and the king gave no heed to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And he commanded that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan's</a> garments should be taken off, and that he should be clothed with purple: and they did so. And the king made him sit by himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> And he said to his princes: Go out with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> complain against him of any matter, and that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> trouble him for any manner of cause.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> So when his accusers saw his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> proclaimed, and him clothed with purple, they all fled away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And the king magnified him, and enrolled him amongst his chief friends, and made him governor, and partaker of his dominion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> returned into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> In the year one hundred and sixty-five, Demetrius, the son of Demetrius, came from Crete into the land of his fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> And king Alexander heard of it, and was much troubled, and returned to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> And king Demetrius made Apollonius his general, who was governor of Celesyria: and he gathered together a great army, and came to Jamnia: and he sent to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse70">70</span> Saying: Thou alone standest against us, and I am laughed at and reproached, because thou showest thy power against us in the mountains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse71">71</span> Now, therefore, if thou trustest in thy forces, come down to us into the plain, and there let us try one another: for with me is the strength of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse72">72</span> Ask, and learn who I am, and the rest that help me, who also say that your foot cannot stand before our face, for thy fathers have twice been put to flight in their own land:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse73">73</span> And now how wilt thou be able to abide the horsemen, and so great an army in the plain, where there is no stone, nor rock, nor place to flee to?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse74">74</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind: and he chose ten thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and went out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and Simon, his brother, met him to help him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse75">75</span> And they pitched their tents near <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, but they shut him out of the city: because a garrison of Apollonius was in <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, and he laid siege to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse76">76</span> And they that were in the city being affrighted, opened the gates to him: so <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> took <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse77">77</span> And Apollonius heard of it, and he took three thousand horsemen, and a great army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse78">78</span> And he went to <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, as one that was making a journey, and immediately he went forth into the plain: because he had a great number of horsemen, and he trusted in them. And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> followed after him to <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and they joined battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse79">79</span> And Apollonius left privately in the camp a thousand horsemen behind them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse80">80</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> knew that there was an ambush behind him, and they surrounded his army, and cast darts at the people from morning till evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse81">81</span> But the people stood still, as <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> had commanded them: and so their horses were fatigued.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse82">82</span> Then Simon drew forth his army, and attacked the legion: for the horsemen were wearied: and they were discomfited by him, and fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse83">83</span> And they that were scattered about the plain fled into <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and went into <a href="../cathen/02532c.htm">Bethdagon</a>, their idol's <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a>, there to save themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse84">84</span> But <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> set fire to <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and the cities that were round about it, and took the spoils of them and the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a>: and all them that were fled into it, he burnt with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse85">85</span> So they that were slain by the sword, with them that were burnt, were almost eight thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse86">86</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, removed his army from thence and camped against <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>: and they went out of the city to meet him with great honour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse87">87</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> returned into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with his people, having many spoils.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse88">88</span> And it came to pass, when Alexander, the king heard these words, that he honoured <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> yet more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse89">89</span> And he sent him a buckle of gold, as the custom is, to be given to such as are of the royal blood. And he gave him <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>, and all the borders thereof, in possession.</span></p>
