<div class="h1a">Ptolemee invades the kingdom of Alexander: the latter is slain: and the former dies soon after. Demetrius honours Jonathan, and is rescued by the Jews from his own subjects in Antioch. Antiochus the younger favours Jonathan. His exploits in various places.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> gathered together an army, like the sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships: and he sought to get the kingdom of Alexander by deceit, and join it to his own kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he went out into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> with peaceable words and they opened to him the cities, and met him: for king Alexander had ordered them to go forth to meet him, because he was his father in law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now when Ptolemee entered into the cities, he put garrisons of soldiers in every city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when he came near to <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, they showed him the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a> that was burnt with fire, and <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and the suburbs thereof, that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad, and the graves of them that were slain in the battle, which they had made near the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they told the king that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> had done these things, to make him odious: but the king held his peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> came to meet the king at <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and they saluted one another, and they lodged there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> went with the king as far as the river, called Eleutherus: and he returned into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And king Ptolemee got the dominion of the cities by the sea side, even to Seleucia, and he devised <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> designs against Alexander.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he sent ambassadors to Demetrius, saying: Come, let us make a league between us, and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in the kingdom of thy father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For I repent that I have given him my daughter: for he hath sought to kill me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he slandered him, because he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> his kingdom,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he took away his daughter, and gave her to Demetrius, and alienated himself from Alexander, and his enmities were made manifest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Ptolemee entered into <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and set two crowns upon his head, that of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and that of Asia.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now king Alexander was in Cilicia at that time: because they that were in those places had rebelled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when Alexander heard of it, he came to give him battle: and king Ptolemee brought forth his army, and met him with a strong power, and put him to flight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Alexander fled into Arabia, there to be protected: and king Ptolemee was exalted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander's head, and sent it to Ptolemee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And king Ptolemee died the third day after: and they that were in the strong holds were destroyed by them that were within the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Demetrius reigned in the hundred and sixty-seventh year.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> In those days <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> gathered together them that were in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, to take the castle that was in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and they made many engines of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> their own nation, went away to king Demetrius, and told him that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> was besieging the castle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when he heard it, he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: and forthwith he came to <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, and wrote to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> that he should not besiege the castle, but should come to him in haste, and speak to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But when <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> heard this, he bade them besiege it still: and he chose some of the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and put himself in danger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he took gold, and silver, and raiment, and many other presents, and went to the king to <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a> and he found favour in his sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of his nation made complaints against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the king treated him as his predecessors had done before: and he exalted him in the sight of all his friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he confirmed him in the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> and all the honours he had before, and he made him the chief of his friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> requested of the king that he would make <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> free from tribute, and the three governments, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and the confines thereof: and he promised him three hundred talents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the king consented: and he wrote <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> of all these things, to this effect.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> King Demetrius to his brother, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and to the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> We send you here a copy of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> which we have written to Lasthenes, our parent, concerning you, that you might know it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> King Demetrius to Lasthenes, his parent, greetings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> We have determined to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who are our friends, and keep the things that are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> with us, for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will which they bear towards us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> We have ratified, therefore, unto them all the borders of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and the three cities, Apherema, <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a>, and Ramatha, which are added to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and all their confines, to be set apart to all them that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, instead of the payments which the king received of them every year, and for the fruits of the land, and of the trees. <span class="stiki"><strong>Apherema...</strong> is found only in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Greek version</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And as for other things that belonged to us of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and of the tributes, from this time we discharge them of them: the saltpans also, and the crowns that were presented to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> We give all to them, and nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth and for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Now, therefore, see that thou make a copy of these things, and let it be given to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and set upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain, in a conspicuous place.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And king Demetrius, seeing that the land was quiet before him, and nothing resisted him, sent away all his forces, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his own place, except the foreign army, which he had drawn together from the islands of the nations: so all the troops of his fathers <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Now there was one Tryphon who had been of Alexander's party before: who seeing that all the army murmured against Demetrius, went to Emalchuel, the Arabian, who brought up Antiochus, the son of Alexander:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And he pressed him much to deliver him to him, that he might be king in his father's place: and he told him all that Demetrius had done, and how his soldiers <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him. And he remained there many days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> sent to king Demetrius, desiring that he would cast out them that were in the castle in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and those that were in the strong holds: because they fought against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And Demetrius sent to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, saying: I will not only do this for thee, and for thy people, but I will greatly honour thee, and thy nation, when opportunity shall serve.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Now, therefore, thou shalt do well if thou send me <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to help me: for all my army is gone from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> sent him three thousand <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>: and they came to the king, and the king was very glad of their coming.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And they that were of the city assembled themselves together, to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and would have killed the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And the king fled into the palace: and they of the city kept the passages of the city, and began to fight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And the king called the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to his assistance: and they came to him all at once, and they all dispersed themselves through the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And they slew in that day a hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they set fire to the city, and got many spoils that day, and delivered the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And they that were of the city saw that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had got the city as they would: and they were discouraged in their minds, and cried to the king, making supplication, and saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Grant us peace, and let the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cease from assaulting us, and the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And they threw down their arms, and made peace, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm, and were renowned throughout the kingdom, and returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with many spoils.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> So king Demetrius sat in the throne of his kingdom: and the land was quiet before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And he falsified all whatsoever he had said, and alienated himself from <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and did not reward him according to the benefits he had received from him, but gave him great trouble.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And after this Tryphon returned, and with him Antiochus, the young boy, who was made king, and put on the diadem.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And there assembled unto him all the hands which Demetrius had sent away, and they fought against Demetrius who turned his back and fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And Tryphon took the elephants, and made himself master of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And young Antiochus wrote to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, saying: I confirm thee in the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>, and I appoint thee ruler over the four cities, and to be one of the king's friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And he sent him vessels of gold for his service, and he gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And he made his brother, Simon, governor, from the borders of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> even to the confines of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the river, and all the forces of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> gathered themselves to him to help him, and he came to <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, and they met him honourably out of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And he went from thence to <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>: and they that were in <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> shut him out: and he besieged it, and burnt all the suburbs round about, and took the spoils.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> made supplication to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and he gave them the right hand: and he took their sons for hostages, and sent them to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and he went through the country, as far as <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> heard that the generals of Demetrius were come treacherously to <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, with a great army, purposing to remove him from the affairs of the kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> And he went against them: but left his brother, Simon, in the country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And Simon encamped against Bethsura, and assaulted it many days, and shut them up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And they desired him to make peace, and he granted it them: and he cast them out from thence, and took the city, and placed a garrison in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and his army encamped by the water of <a href="../cathen/06413a.htm">Genesar</a>, and before it was light they were ready in the plain of Asor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> And behold the army of the strangers met him in the plain, and they laid an ambush for him in the mountains: but he went out against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> And they that lay in ambush rose out of their places, and joined battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse70">70</span> And all that were on <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan's</a> side fled, and none was left of them, but <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, and Judas, the son of Calphi, chief <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse71">71</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> rent his garments, and cast earth upon his head, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse72">72</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> turned again to them to battle, and he put them to flight, and they fought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse73">73</span> And they of his part that fled saw this, and they turned again to him, and they all with him pursued the enemies, even to <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>, to their own camp, and they came even thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse74">74</span> And there fell of the aliens in that day three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> returned to Jerusalem.</span></p>
