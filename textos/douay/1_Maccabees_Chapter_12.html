<div class="h1a">Jonathan renews his league with the Romans and Lacedemonians. The forces of Demetrius flee away from him. He is deceived and made prisoner by Tryphon.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> saw that the time served him, and he chose certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and sent them to Rome, to confirm and to renew the amity with them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he sent <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to the Spartans, and to other places, according to the same form.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they went to Rome, and entered into the senate house, and said: <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, have sent us to renew the amity, and alliance, as it was before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they gave them <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to their governors in every place, to conduct them into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> with peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And this is a copy of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> which <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> wrote to the Spartans:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and the ancients of the nation, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the rest of the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to the Spartans, their brethren, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> There were <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> sent long ago to <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, from Arius, who reigned then among you to signify that you are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a> received the ambassador with honour and received the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>, wherein there was mention made of the alliance, and amity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> We, though we needed none of these things having for our comfort the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> books that are in our hands,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Chose rather to send to you to renew the brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers to you altogether: for there is a long time passed since you sent to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> We, therefore, at all times without ceasing, both in our festivals, and other days wherein it is convenient, remember you in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> that we offer, and in our observances, as it is meet and becoming to remember brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And we rejoice at your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But we have had many troubles and wars on every side; and the kings that are round about us have fought against us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But we would not be troublesome to you, nor to the rest of our allies and friends, in these wars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For we have had help from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and we have been delivered, and our enemies are <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> We have chosen, therefore, Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater, the son of <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a>, and have sent them to the Romans, to renew with them the former amity and alliance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And we have commanded them to go also to you, and salute you, and to deliver you our <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>, concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And now you shall do well to give us an answer hereto.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And this is the copy of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> which he had sent to <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Arius, king of the Spartans, to <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> It is found in writing concerning the Spartans, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that they are brethren, and that they are of the stock of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And now since this is come to our knowledge, you do well to write to us of your prosperity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And we also have written back to you, That our cattle, and our <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>, are yours: and yours, ours. We, therefore, have commanded that these things should be told you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> heard that the generals of Demetrius were come again with a greater army than before to fight against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> So he went out from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and met them in the land of Amath: for he gave them no time to enter into his country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he sent spies into their camp, and they came back, and brought him word that they designed to come upon them in the night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when the sun was set, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> commanded his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to watch, and to be in arms all night long ready to fight, and he set sentinels round about the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the enemies heard that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were ready for battle: and they were struck with fear and dread in their heart: and they kindled fires in their camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and they that were with him, knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> pursued after them, but overtook them not: for they had passed the river Eleutherus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> turned upon the Arabians, that are called Zabadeans: and he defeated them, and took the spoils of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he went forward, and came to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and passed through all that country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Simon also went forth, and came as far as <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, and the neighbouring fortresses, and he turned aside to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, and took possession of it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> (For he heard that they designed to deliver the hold to them that took part with Demetrius) and he put a garrison there to keep it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> came back, and called together the ancients of the people; and he took a resolution with them to build fortresses in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And to build up walls in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and raise a mount between the castle and the city, to separate it from the city, that so it might have no communication, and that they might neither buy nor sell.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And they came together to build up the city: for the wall that was upon the brook, towards the east, was broken down, and he repaired that which is called Caphetetha:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And Simon built Adiada in Sephela, and fortified it, and set up gates and bars.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Now when Tryphon had conceived a design to make himself king of Asia and to take the crown, and to stretch out his hand against king Antiochus:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Fearing lest <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> would not suffer him, but would fight against him: he sought to seize upon him, and to kill him. So he rose up and came to <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> went out to meet him with forty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> chosen for battle, and came to <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Now when Tryphon saw that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> came with a great army, he durst not stretch forth his hand against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> But received him with honour, and commended him to all his friends, and gave him presents: and he commanded his troops to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him, as himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>: Why hast thou troubled all the people, whereas we have no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Now, therefore, send them back to their own houses: and choose thee a few <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that may be with thee, and come with me to <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, and I will deliver it to thee, and the rest of the strong holds, and the army, and all that have any charge, and I will return and go away: for this is the cause of my coming.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him, and did as he said: and sent away his army, and they departed into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> But he kept with him three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: of whom he sent two thousand into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and one thousand went with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Now as soon as <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> entered into <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, they of <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a> shut the gates of the city, and took him: and all them that came in with him they slew with the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Then Tryphon sent an army and horsemen into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and into the great plain, to destroy all <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan's</a> company.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> But they, when they understood that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and all that were with him, were taken and slain, encouraged one another, and went out ready for battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> Then they that had come after them, seeing that they stood for their lives, returned back.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Whereupon they all came peaceably into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and they bewailed <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and them that had been with him, exceedingly: and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> mourned with great lamentation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> Then all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> that were round about them, sought to destroy them. For they said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> They have no prince, nor any to help them: now therefore, let us make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon them, and take away the memory of them from amongst <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
