<h1>1 Maccabees Chapter 13</h1>
<div class="h1a">Simon is made captain general in the room of his brother. Jonathan is slain by Tryphon. Simon is favoured by Demetrius: he takes Gaza, and the castle of Jerusalem.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now Simon heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great army to invade the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and to destroy it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And seeing that the people was in dread and in fear, he went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and assembled the people,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And exhorted them, saying: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought for the laws, and the sanctuary, and the distresses that we have seen:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> By reason whereof all my brethren have lost their lives for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> sake, and I am left alone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And now far be it from me to spare my life in any time of trouble: for I am not better than my brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I will avenge then my nation and the sanctuary, and our children, and wives: for all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> are gathered together to destroy us out of mere malice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the spirit of the people was enkindled as soon as they heard these words:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they answered with a loud voice, saying: Thou art our leader in the place of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, thy brother:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Fight thou our battles, and we will do whatsoever thou shalt say to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So gathering together all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, he made haste to finish all the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and he fortified it round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he sent <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, and with him a new army, into <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, and he cast out them that were in it, and himself remained there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Tryphon removed from <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a> with a great army, to invade the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> was with him in custody.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But Simon pitched in Addus, over against the plain.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when Tryphon understood that Simon was risen up in the place of his brother, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and that he meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers to him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Saying: We have detained thy brother, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, for the money that he owed in the king's account, by reason of the affairs which he had the management of.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But now send a hundred talents of silver, and his two sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will release him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now Simon knew that he spoke deceitfully to him; nevertheless, he ordered the money and the children to be sent, lest he should bring upon himself a great <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who might have said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Because he sent not the money and the children therefore is he lost.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> So he sent the children and the hundred talents and he lied, and did not let <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> go.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And after this, Tryphon entered within the country, to destroy it: and they went about by the way that leadeth to Ador: and Simon and his army marched to every place whithersoever they went. <span class="stiki"><strong>Simon and his army marched to every place whithersoever they went...</strong> That is, whithersoever Tryphon and his horsemen went in order to oppose them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they that were in the castle, sent messengers to Tryphon, that he should make haste to come through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and send them victuals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night; but there fell a very great snow, and he came not into the country of Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when he approached to Bascama, he slew <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and his sons there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Tryphon returned, and went into his own country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And Simon sent, and took the bones of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, his brother, and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> bewailed him with great lamentation: and they mourned for him many days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his brethren, a building lofty to the sight, of polished stone, behind and before:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he set up seven pyramids, one against another, for his father, and his mother, and his four brethren:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And round about these he set great pillars; and upon the pillars, arms, for a perpetual memory; and by the arms, ships carved, which might be seen by all that sailed on the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> This is the sepulchre that he made in Modin, even unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But Tryphon, when he was upon a journey with the young king, Antiochus, treacherously slew him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he reigned in his place, and put on the crown of Asia: and brought great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon the land.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And Simon built up the strong holds of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, fortifying them with high towers, and great walls, and gates and bars: and he stored up victuals in the fortresses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And Simon chose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end that he should grant an immunity to the land; for all that Tryphon did, was to spoil.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And king Demetrius, in answer to this request, wrote a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> in this manner:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> King Demetrius to Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and friend of kings, and to the ancients, and to the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, greeting:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> The golden crown, and the palm, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a firm peace with you, and to write to the king's chief officers to release you the things that we have released.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> For all that we have decreed in your favour shall stand in force. The strong holds that you have built, shall be your own.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And as for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it: and the crown which you owed: and if any other thing were taxed in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, now let it not be taxed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> In the year one hundred and seventy, the yoke of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> was taken off from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> began to write in the instruments, and public records, The first year under Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>, and prince of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> In those days Simon besieged <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and camped round about it, and he made engines, and set them to the city, and he struck one tower, and took it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And they that were within the engine leapt into the city: and there was a great uproar in the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And they that were in the city went up, with their wives and children, upon the wall, with their garments rent, and they cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And they said: Deal not with us according to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, but according to thy mercy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And Simon being moved, did not destroy them but yet he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein there had been idols, and then he entered into it with hymns, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And having cast out of it all <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, he placed in it <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that should observe the law: and he fortified it, and made it his habitation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> But they that were in the castle of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were hindered from going out and coming into the country, and from buying and selling: and they were straitened with hunger, and many of them perished through famine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And they cried to Simon for peace, and he granted it to them: and he cast them out from thence and cleansed the castle from <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleannesses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, in the year one hundred and seventy-one, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and harps, and cymbals, and psalteries, and hymns, and canticles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And he ordained that these days should be kept every year with gladness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And he fortified the mountain of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> that was near the castle, and he dwelt there himself, and they that were with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And Simon saw that John, his son, was a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and he made him <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of all the forces: and he dwelt in Gazara.</span></p>
