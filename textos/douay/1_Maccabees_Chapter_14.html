<h1>1 Maccabees Chapter 14</h1>
<div class="h1a">Demetrius is taken by the king of Persia. Judea flourishes under the government of Simon.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the year one hundred and seventy-two king Demetrius assembled his army, and went into <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a> to get him succours to fight against Tryphon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Arsaces, the king of Persia and <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>, heard that Demetrius was entered within his borders, and he sent one of his princes to take him alive, and bring him to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he went, and defeated the army of Demetrius: and took him, and brought him to Arsaces, and he put him into custody.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And all the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> was at rest all the days of Simon, and he sought the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of his nation: and his power, and his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> pleased them well all his days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And with all his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> he took <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> for a haven, and made an entrance to the isles of the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he enlarged the bounds of his nation, and made himself master of the country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he gathered together a great number of captives, and had the dominion of Gazara, and of Bethsura, and of the castle: and took away all <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> out of it, and there was none that resisted him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> tilled his land with peace, and the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> yielded her increase, and the trees of the fields their fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The ancient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> sat all in the streets, and treated together of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the land, and the young men put on them <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the robes of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he provided victuals for the cities, and he appointed that they should be furnished with ammunition, so that the fame of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was renowned even to the end of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He made peace in the land, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> rejoiced with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sat under his vine, and under his fig tree: and there was none to make them afraid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> There was none left in the land to fight against them: kings were discomfited in those days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he strengthened all those of his people that were brought low, and he sought the law, and took away every <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the sanctuary, and multiplied the vessels of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> was dead: and they were very sorry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But when they heard that Simon, his brother, was made <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> in his place, and was possessed of all the country, and the cities therein:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> They wrote to him in tables of brass, to renew the friendship and alliance which they had made with <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and with <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, his brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they were read before the assembly in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. And this is the copy of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> that the Spartans sent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The princes and the cities of the Spartans, to Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and to the ancients, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the rest of the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, their brethren, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The ambassadors that were sent to our people, have told us of your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and honour, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: and we rejoiced at their coming.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And we registered what was said by them in the councils of the people, in this manner: Numenius, the son of Antiochus, and Antipater, the son of <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a>, ambassadors of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, came to us to renew the former friendship with us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And it pleased the people to receive the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> honourably, and to put a copy of their words in the public records, to be a memorial to the people of the Spartans. And we have written a copy of them to Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And after this Simon sent Numenius to Rome, with a great shield of gold, of the weight of a thousand pounds, to confirm the league with them. And when the people of Rome had heard</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> These words, they said: What thanks shall we give to Simon, and his sons:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For he hath restored his brethren, and hath driven away in fight the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from them: and they decreed him liberty, and registered it in tables of brass, and set it upon pillars in mount Sion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And this is a copy of the writing. The eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the year one hundred and seventy-two, being the third year under Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, at Asaramel,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> In a great assembly of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and of the people, and the princes of the nation, and the ancients of the country, these things were notified: Forasmuch as there have often been wars in our country,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And Simon, the son of <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a>, of the children of Jarib, and his brethren, have put themselves in danger, and resisted the enemies of their nation, for the maintenance of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, and the law: and have raised their nation to great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> gathered together his nation, and was made their <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and he was laid to his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And their enemies desired to tread down and destroy their country, and to stretch forth their hands against their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Then Simon resisted and fought for his nation, and laid out much of his money, and armed the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of his nation, and gave them wages.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he fortified the cities of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and Bethsura that lieth in the borders of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, where the armour of the enemies was before: and he placed there a garrison of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he fortified <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, which lieth by the sea: and Gazara, which bordereth upon <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, wherein the enemies dwelt before, and he placed <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> here: and furnished them with all things convenient for their reparation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the people seeing the acts of Simon, and to what <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> he meant to bring his nation, made him their prince and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, because he had done all these things, and for the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he kept to his nation, and for that he sought by all means to advance his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> were taken away out of their country, and they also that were in the city of David, in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the castle, out of which they issued forth, and profaned all places round about the sanctuary, and did much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to its purity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And he placed therein <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for the defence of the country, and of the city, and he raised up the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And king Demetrius confirmed him in the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> According to these things he made him his friend, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> him with great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> For he had heard that the Romans had called the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> their friends, and confederates, and brethren, and that they had received Simon's ambassadors with honour:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, had consented that he should be their prince and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> for ever, till there should arise a faithful <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And that he should be chief over them, and that he should have the charge of the sanctuary, and that he should appoint rulers over their works, and over the country, and over the armour, and over the strong holds;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And that he should have care of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places; and that he should be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> by all, and that all the writings in the country should be made in his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>; and that he should be clothed with purple and gold:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And that it should not be lawful for any of the people, or of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to disannul any of these things, or to gainsay his words, or to call together an assembly in the country without him: or to be clothed with purple, or to wear a buckle of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And whosoever shall do otherwise, or shall make void any of these things, shall be punished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And it pleased all the people to establish Simon, and to do according to these words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And Simon accepted thereof, and was well pleased to execute the office of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>, and to be <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>, and prince of the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and to be chief over all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of the sanctuary, in a conspicuous place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And that a copy thereof should be put in the treasury, that Simon, and his sons, may have it.</span></p>
