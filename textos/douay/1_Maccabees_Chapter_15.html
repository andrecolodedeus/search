<div class="h1a">Antiochus son of Demetrius honours Simon. The Romans write to various nations in favour of the Jews. Antiochus quarrels with Simon, and sends troops to annoy him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And king Antiochus, the son of Demetrius, sent <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> from the isles of the sea to Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and prince of the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and to all the people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the contents were these: King Antiochus to Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and to the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Forasmuch as certain pestilent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge the kingdom, and to restore it to its former estate; and I have chosen a great army, and have built ships of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I design to go through the country, that I may take revenge of them that have destroyed our country, and that have made many cities desolate in my realm.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now, therefore, I confirm unto thee all the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblations</a> which all the kings before me remitted to thee, and what other gifts soever they remitted to thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I give thee leave to coin thy own money in thy country:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And let <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and free, and all the armour that hath been made, and the fortresses which thou hast built, and which thou keepest in thy hands, let them remain to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And all that is due to the king, and what should be the king's hereafter, from this present and for ever, is forgiven thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when we shall have recovered our kingdom, we will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> thee, and thy nation, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, with great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so that your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be made manifest in all the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> In the year one hundred and seventy-four, Antiochus entered into the land of his fathers, and all the forces assembled to him, so that few were left with Tryphon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And king Antiochus pursued after him, and he fled along by the sea coast and came to <a href="../cathen/05133b.htm">Dora</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For he perceived that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> were gathered together upon him, and his troops had forsaken him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Antiochus camped above <a href="../cathen/05133b.htm">Dora</a> with a hundred and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and eight thousand horsemen:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he invested the city, and the ships drew near by sea: and they annoyed the city by land, and by sea, and suffered none to come in, or to go out.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Numenius, and they that had been with him, came from the city of Rome, having <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> written to the kings, and countries, the contents whereof were these:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Lucius, the consul of the Romans, to king Ptolemee, greeting. <span class="stiki"><strong>Ptolemee...</strong> Surnamed Physeon, brother and successor to Philometer.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The ambassadors of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, our friends, came to us, to renew the former friendship and alliance, being sent from Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they brought also a shield of gold of a thousand pounds.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> It hath seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> therefore to us, to write to the kings and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries: and that they should give no aid to them that fight against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And it hath seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us to receive the shield of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> If, therefore, any pestilent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are fled out of their country to you, deliver them to Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, that he may punish them according to their law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> These same things were written to king Demetrius, and to Attalus, and to Ariarathes, and to Arsaces, <span class="stiki"><strong>Attalus, etc...</strong> Attalus was king of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamus</a>; Ariarathes was king of Cappadocia; and Arsaces was king of the Parthians.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And to all the countries: and to Lampsacus and to the Spartans, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samus, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Alicarnassus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>, and Phaselis, and Gortyna, and Gnidus, and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and Cyrene.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they wrote a copy thereof to Simon, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and to the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But king Antiochus moved his camp to <a href="../cathen/05133b.htm">Dora</a> the second time, assaulting it continually, and making engines: and he shut up Tryphon, that he could not go out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And Simon sent to him two thousand chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to aid him, silver also, and gold, and abundance of furniture.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he would not receive them, but broke all the covenant that he had made with him before, and alienated himself from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he sent to him Athenobius, one of his friends, to treat with him, saying: You hold <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> and Gazara, and the castle that is in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which are cities of my kingdom:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Their borders you have wasted, and you have made great havoc in the land, and have got the dominion of many places in my kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Now, therefore, deliver up the cities that you have taken, and the tributes of the places whereof you have gotten the dominion without the borders of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But if not, give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and for the havoc that you have made, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: or else we will come and fight against you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> So Athenobius, the king's friend came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Simon and his magnificence in gold, and silver, and his great equipage, and he was astonished, and told him the king's words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And Simon answered him, and said to him: We have neither taken other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> land, neither do we hold that which is other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a>, but the inheritance of our fathers, which was for some time <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> possessed by our enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But we having opportunity, claim the inheritance of our fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And as to thy complaints concerning <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> and Gazara, they did great harm to the people, and to our country: yet for these we will give a hundred talents. And Athenobius answered him not a word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But returning in a rage to the king, made report to him of these words, and of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Simon, and of all that he had seen, and the king was exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And Tryphon fled away by ship to Orthosias.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And the king appointed Cendebeus <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the sea coast, and gave him an army of footmen and horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he commanded him to march with his army towards <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>: and he commanded him to build up <a href="../cathen/06332a.htm">Gedor</a>, and to fortify the gates of the city, and to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the people. But the king himself pursued after Tryphon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And Cendebeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people, and to ravage <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and to take the people prisoners, and to kill, and to build <a href="../cathen/06332a.htm">Gedor</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And he placed there horsemen, and an army: that they might issue forth, and make incursions upon the ways of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, as the king had commanded him.</span></p>
