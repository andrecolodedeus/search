<h1>1 Maccabees Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">The sons of Simon defeat the troops of Antiochus. Simon with two of his sons are treacherously murdered by Ptolemee his son in law.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then John came up from Gazara, and told Simon, his father, what Cendebeus had done against their people. <span class="stiki"><strong>John...</strong> He was afterwards surnamed Hircanus, and succeeded his father in both his dignities of <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and prince. He conquered the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a>, and obliged them to a conformity with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>; and destroyed the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John, and said to them: I and my brethren, and my father's house, have fought against the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from our youth even to this day: and things have prospered so well in our hands, that we have delivered <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> oftentimes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And now I am old, but be you instead of me, and my brethren, and go out, and fight for our nation: and the help from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> be with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then he chose out of the country twenty thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and horsemen, and they went forth against Cendebeus: and they rested in Modin.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they arose in the morning, and went into the plain: and behold a very great army of footmen and horsemen came against them, and there was a running river between them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he and his people pitched their camp over against them, and he saw that the people were afraid to go over the river, so he went over first: then the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> seeing him, passed over after him. <span class="stiki"><strong>He...</strong> Viz., John.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he divided the people, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: but the horsemen of the enemies were very numerous.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they sounded the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> trumpets: and Cendebeus and his army were put to flight: and there fell many of them wounded, and the rest fled into the strong hold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> At that time, Judas, John's brother, was wounded: but John pursued after them, till he came to Cedron, which he had built: <span class="stiki"><strong>Cedron...</strong> Otherwise called Gedon, the city that Cendebeus was fortifying.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they fled even to the towers that were in the fields of <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and he burnt them with fire. And there fell of them two thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and he returned into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> in peace.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now Ptolemee, the son of Abobus, was appointed <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> in the plain of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and he had abundance of silver and gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For he was son in law of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And his heart was lifted up, and he designed to make himself master of the country, and he purposed treachery against Simon and his sons, to destroy them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now Simon, as he was going through the cities that were in the country of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and taking care for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ordering of them, went down to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, he and <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> and Judas, his sons, in the year one hundred and seventy-seven, the eleventh month: the same is the month Sabath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the son of Abobus received them deceitfully into a little fortress, that is called Doch, which he had built: and he made them a great feast, and hid <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when Simon and his sons had drunk plentifully, Ptolemee and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> rose up, and took their weapons, and entered into the banqueting place, and slew him, and his two sons, and some of his servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he committed a great treachery in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and rendered <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Ptolemee wrote these things, and sent to the king that he should send him an army to aid him, and he would deliver him the country, and their cities, and tributes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he sent others to Gazara to kill John: and to the tribunes he sent <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to come to him, and that he would give them silver, and gold, and gifts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he sent others to take <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the mountain of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now one running before, told John in Gazara, that his father and his brethren were slain, and that he hath sent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to kill thee also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But when he heard it, he was exceedingly afraid: and he apprehended the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that came to kill him, and he put them to death: for he knew that they sought to make him away.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And as concerning the rest of the acts of John, and his wars, and the worthy deeds, which he bravely achieved, and the building of the walls, which he made, and the things that he did:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Behold, these are written in the book of the days of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, from the time that he was made <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> after his father.</span></p>
