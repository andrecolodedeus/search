<div class="h1a">The zeal and success of Mathathias. His exhortation to his sons at his death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In those days arose <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a>, the son of John, the son of Simeon, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the sons of Joarib, from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and he abode in the mountain of Modin:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he had five sons: John, who was surnamed Gaddis:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Simon, who was surnamed Thasi;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas, who was called Machabeus</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a>, who was surnamed Abaron; and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, who was surnamed Apphus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> These saw the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that were done in the people of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> said: Woe is me, wherefore was I born to see the ruin of my people, and the ruin of the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>, and to dwell there, when it is given into the hands of the enemies?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">holy places</a> are come into the hands of strangers: her <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> is become as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> without honour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The vessels of her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are carried away captive; her old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are murdered in the streets, and her young men are fallen by the sword of the enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> What nation hath not inherited her kingdom, and gotten of her spoils?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> All her ornaments are taken away. She that was free is made a slave.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And behold our sanctuary, and our beauty, and our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is laid waste, and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> have defiled them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> To what end then should we live any longer?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> and his sons rent their garments, and they covered themselves with haircloth, and made great lamentation.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they that were sent from king Antiochus, came thither, to compel them that were fled into the city of Modin, to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and to depart from the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And many of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> consented and came to them: but <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> and his sons stood firm.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they that were sent from Antiochus, answering, said to <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a>: Thou art a ruler, and an honourable, and great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in this city, and adorned with sons, and brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore, come thou first, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the king's commandment, as all nations have done, and the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, and they that remain in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and thou, and thy sons shall be in the number of the king's friends, and enriched with gold, and silver, and many presents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> answered, and said with a loud voice: Although all nations <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> king Antiochus, so as to depart every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the service of the law of his fathers, and consent to his commandments:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> I and my sons, and my brethren will <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the law of our fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be merciful unto us: it is not profitable for us to forsake the law, and the justices of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> We will not hearken to the words of king Antiochus, neither will we <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and transgress the commandments of our law, to go another way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now as he left off speaking these words, there came a certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> in the sight of all to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the idols upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> in the city of Modin, according to the king's commandment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> saw, and was grieved, and his reins trembled, and his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> was kindled according to the judgment of the law, and running upon him he slew him upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Moreover the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom king Antiochus had sent, who compelled them to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, he slew at the same time, and pulled down the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And showed zeal for the law, as Phinees did by Zamri, the son of Salomi.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: Every one that hath zeal for the law, and maintaineth the testament, let him follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they had in the city.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then many that sought after judgment, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, went down into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they abode there, they and their children, and their wives, and their cattle: because afflictions increased upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And it was told to the king's <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to the army that was in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the city of David, that certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who had broken the king's commandment, were gone away into the secret places in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and that many were gone after them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And forthwith they went out towards them, and made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they said to them: Do you still resist? come forth, and do according to the edict of king Antiochus, and you shall live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And they said: We will not come forth, neither will we <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the king's edict, to profane the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And they made haste to give them battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But they answered them not, neither did they <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">cast a stone</a> at them, nor stopped up the secret places,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Saying: Let us all die in our innocency: and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth shall be witnesses for us, that you put us to death wrongfully.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> So they gave them battle on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>: and they were slain, with their wives, and their children, and their cattle, to the number of a thousand persons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> and his friends heard of it, and they mourned for them exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said to his neighbour: If we shall all do as our brethren have done, and not fight against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> for our lives, and our justifications, they will now quickly root us out of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And they determined in that day, saying: Whosoever shall come up against us to fight on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>, we will fight against him: and we will not all die, as our brethren that were slain in the secret places.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Then was assembled to them the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/01800b.htm">Assideans</a>, the stoutest of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, every one that had a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will for the law. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Assideans...</strong> A set of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that led a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>; and were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And all they that fled from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, joined themselves to them, and were a support to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And they gathered an army, and slew the sinners in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and the wicked <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in their indignation: and the rest fled to the nations for safety.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> and his friends went round about, and they threw down the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And they <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> all the children whom they found in the confines of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that were uncircumcised: and they did <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiantly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And they pursued after the children of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and the work prospered in their hands:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And they recovered the law out of the hands of the nations, and out of the hands of the kings: and they yielded not the horn to the sinner. <span class="stiki"><strong>They yielded not the horn, etc...</strong> That is, they suffered not the power of Antiochus, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to abolish the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Now the days drew near that <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a> should die, and he said to his sons: Now hath <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and chastisement gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of indignation:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Now, therefore, O my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And call to remembrance the works of the fathers, which they have done in their <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>: and you shall receive great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and an everlasting <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Was not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> found faithful in temptation, and it was reputed to him unto <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, in the time of his distress, kept the commandment, and he was made lord of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Phinees, our father, by being fervent in the zeal of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, received the covenant of an everlasting <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Jesus</a>, whilst he fulfilled the word, was made ruler in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Jesus...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>, for bearing witness before the congregation, received an inheritance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, by his mercy, obtained the throne of an everlasting kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, while he was full of zeal for the law, was taken up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> Ananias and Azarias and Misael, by believing, were delivered out of the flame.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, in his innocency, was delivered out of the mouth of the lions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And thus consider, through all <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>: that none that trust in him, fail in strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And fear not the words of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is dung and worms:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> Today he is lifted up, and tomorrow he shall not be found, because he is returned into his earth and his thought is come to nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> You, therefore, my sons, take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and behave manfully in the law: for by it you shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of counsel: give ear to him always, and he shall be a father to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> and strong from his youth up, let him be the leader of your army, and he shall manage the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> And you shall take to you all that observe the law: and revenge ye the wrong of your people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> Render to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> their reward, and take heed to the precepts of the law.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> And he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them, and was joined to his fathers.</span>
