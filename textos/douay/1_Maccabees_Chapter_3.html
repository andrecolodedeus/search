<div class="h1a">Judas Maccabee succeeds his father, and overthrows Apollonius and Seron. A great army is sent against him out of Syria. He prepares his people for battle by fasting and prayer.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then his son <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas, called Machabeus</a>, rose up in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And all his brethren helped him, and all they that had joined themselves to his father, and they fought with cheerfulness the battle of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he got his people great honour, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girt his warlike armour about him in battles, and protected the camp with his sword.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion's whelp roaring for his prey.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he pursued the wicked and sought them out, and them that troubled his people he burnt with fire:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And his enemies were driven away for fear of him, and all the workers of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> were troubled: and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> prospered in his hand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he grieved many kings, and made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a> glad with his works, and his memory is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> for ever.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he went through the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and destroyed the wicked out of them, and turned away <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he was renowned even to the utmost part of the earth, and he gathered them that were perishing.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Apollonius gathered together the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and a numerous and great army from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> understood it, and went forth to meet him: and he overthrew him, and killed him: and many fell down slain, and the rest fled away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he took their spoils, and <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> took the sword of Apollonius, and fought with it all his lifetime.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Seron, <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the army of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, heard that <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> had assembled a company of the faithful, and a congregation with him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he said I will get me a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the kingdom, and will overthrow <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and those that are with him, that have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> the edict of the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he made himself ready; and the host of the wicked went up with him, strong succours, to be revenged of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they approached even as far as Bethoron: and <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> went forth to meet him, with a small company.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>: How shall we, being few, be able to fight against so great a multitude, and so strong, and we are ready to faint with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> today?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> said: It is an easy matter for many to be shut up in the hands of a few: and there is no difference in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to deliver with a great multitude, or with a small company:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For the success of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is not in the multitude of the army, but strength cometh from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> They come against us with an insolent multitude, and with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, to destroy us, and our wives, and our children, and to take our spoils.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But we will fight for our lives, and our laws:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> himself will overthrow them before our face, but as for you, fear them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And as soon as he had made an end of speaking, he rushed suddenly upon them: and Seron, and his host were overthrown before him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he pursued him by the descent of Bethoron, even to the plain, and there fell of them eight hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the rest fled into the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the fear of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and of his brethren, and the dread of them, fell upon all the nations round about them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And his fame came to the king, and all nations told of the battles of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Now when king Antiochus heard these words, he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in his mind: and he sent, and gathered the forces of all his kingdom, an exceeding strong army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he opened his treasury, and gave out pay to the army for a year: and he commanded them, that they should be ready for all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he perceived that the money of his treasures failed, and that the tributes of the country were small, because of the dissension, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he had brought upon the land, that he might take away the laws of old times:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he feared that he should not have as formerly enough for charges and gifts, which he had given before with a liberal hand: for he had abounded more than the kings that had been before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he was greatly perplexed in mind, and purposed to go into Persia, and to take tributes of the countries, and to gather much money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he left Lysias, a nobleman of the blood royal to oversee the affairs of the kingdom from the river Euphrates even to the river of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And to bring up his son, Antiochus, till he came again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he delivered to him half the army, and the elephants: and he gave him charge concerning all that he would have done, and concerning the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And that he should send an army against them to destroy and root out the strength of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and to take away the memory of them from that place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And that he should settle strangers, to dwell in all their coasts, and divide their land by lot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> So the king took the half of the army that remained, and went forth from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, the chief city of his kingdom, in the hundred and forty-seventh year: and he passed over the river Euphrates, and went through the higher countries.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Then Lysias chose Ptolemee, the son of Dorymenus, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the king's friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he sent with them forty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and seven thousand horsemen: to go into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and to destroy it, according to the king's orders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> So they went forth with all their power, and came, and pitched near Emmaus, in the plain country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And the merchants of the countries heard the fame of them: and they took silver and gold in abundance, and servants: and they came into the camp, to buy the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> for slaves: and there were joined to them the forces of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and of the land of the strangers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and his brethren, saw that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> were multiplied, and that the armies approached to their borders: and they knew the orders the king had given to destroy the people, and utterly abolish them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And they said, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his neighbour: Let us raise up the low condition of our people, and let us fight for our people, and our sanctuary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And the assembly was gathered, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and ask mercy and compassion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was not inhabited, but was like a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: there was none of her children that went in or out: and the sanctuary was trodden down: and the children of strangers were in the castle, there was the habitation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was taken away from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and the pipe and harp ceased there.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And they assembled together, and came to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>, over against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: for in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a> was a place of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> heretofore in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And they <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> that day, and put on haircloth, and put ashes upon their heads: and they rent their garments:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And they laid open the books of the law, in which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> searched for the likeness of their idols:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And they brought the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ornaments, and the first fruits and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and stirred up the <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarites</a> that had fulfilled their days:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And they cried with a loud voice toward <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: What shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> For thy holies are trodden down, and are profaned, and thy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are in mourning, and are brought low.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And behold the nations are come together against us, to destroy us: thou knowest what they intend against us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> How shall we be able to stand before their face, unless thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, help us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Then they sounded with trumpets, and cried out with a loud voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And after this, <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> appointed <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> over the people, over thousands, and over <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">hundreds</a>, and over fifties, and over tens.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And he said to them that were building houses, or had <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, that they should return every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his house, according to the law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> So they removed the camp, and pitched on the south side of Emmaus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> said: Gird yourselves, and be <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and be ready against the morning, that you may fight with these nations that are assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> For it is better for us to die in battle, than to see the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of our nation, and of the holies:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> Nevertheless, as it shall be the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, so be it done.</span></p>
