<div class="h1a">Judas routs the king's army. Gorgias flies before him. Lysias comes against him with a great army, but is defeated. Judas cleanses the temple, sets up a new altar, and fortifies the sanctuary.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Gorgias took five thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and a thousand of the best horsemen; and they removed out of the camp by night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> That they might come upon the camp of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and strike them suddenly: and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were of the castle were their guides.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> heard of it, and rose up, he and the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to attack the king's forces that were in Emmaus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For as yet the army was dispersed from the camp <span class="stiki"><strong>The army was dispersed...</strong> That is, in different divisions, not altogether encamped.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Gorgias came by night into the camp of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and found no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and he sought them in the mountains: for he said: These <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> flee from us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when it was day, <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> showed himself in the plain with three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> only, who neither had armour nor swords: <span class="stiki"><strong>Who neither had armour nor swords...</strong> Such as they wished for.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they saw the camp of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> that it was strong, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in breastplates, and the horsemen round about them, and these were trained up to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him: Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Remember in what manner our fathers were saved in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, when <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> pursued them with a great army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And now let us cry to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will have mercy on us, and will remember the covenant of our fathers, and will destroy this army before our face this day:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And all nations shall know that there is one that <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemeth</a> and delivereth <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they went out of the camp to battle, and they that were with <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> sounded the trumpet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they joined battle: and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were routed, and fled into the plain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But all the hindmost of them fell by the sword and they pursued them as far as Gezeron, and even to the plains of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumea</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and of Jamnia: and there fell of them to the number of three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> returned again with his army that followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said to the people: Be not greedy of the spoils; for there is <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> before us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Gorgias and his army are near us in the mountain: but stand ye now against our enemies, and overthrow them, and you shall take the spoils afterwards with safety.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And as <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> was speaking these words, behold part of them appeared, looking forth from the mountain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Gorgias saw that his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were put to flight, and that they had set fire to the camp: for the smoke that was seen declared what was done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when they had seen this, they were seized with great fear, seeing at the same time <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his army in the plain ready to fight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So they all fled away into the land of the strangers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> returned to take the spoils of the camp, and they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and great riches.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And returning home, they sung a hymn, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, because he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because his mercy endureth for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> So <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had a great deliverance that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And such of the strangers as escaped, went and told Lysias all that had happened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when he heard these things, he was amazed and discouraged: because things had not succeeded in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> according to his mind, and as the king had commanded.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So the year following, Lysias gathered together threescore thousand chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they came into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and pitched their tents in Bethoron, and <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> met them with ten thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they saw that the army was strong, and he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> art thou, O Saviour of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who didst break the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the mighty by the hand of thy servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and didst deliver up the camp of the strangers into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and of his armour bearer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Shut up this army in the hands of thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and let them be confounded in their host and their horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Strike them with fear, and cause the boldness of their strength to languish, and let them quake at their own destruction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Cast them down with the sword of them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thee: and let all that know thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> praise thee with hymns.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And they joined battle: and there fell of the army of Lysias five thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when Lysias saw that his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were put to flight, and how bold the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were, and that they were ready either to live, or to die manfully, he went to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and chose soldiers, that they might come again into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> with greater numbers.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and his brethren said: Behold our enemies are discomfited: let us go up now to cleanse the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, and to repair them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And all the army assembled together, and they went up into Mount Sion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> profaned, and the gates burnt, and shrubs growing up in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a> as in a forest, or on the mountains, and the chambers joining to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> thrown down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And they rent their garments, and made great lamentation, and put ashes on their heads:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they fell down to the ground on their faces, and they sounded with the trumpets of alarm, and they cried towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> appointed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to fight against them that were in the castle, till they had cleansed the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And he chose <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> without blemish, whose will was set upon the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And they cleansed the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, and took away the stones that had been defiled into an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he considered about the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ia">altar of holocausts</a> that had been profaned, what he should do with it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel came into their minds, to pull it down: lest it should be a reproach to them, because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> had defiled it; so they threw it down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And they laid up the stones in the mountain of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, in a convenient place, till there should come a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and give answer concerning them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Then they took whole stones, according to the law and built a new <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, according to the former:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And they built up the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, and the things that were within the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and they <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And they made new <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vessels, and brought in the candlestick, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ib">altar of incense</a>, and the table, into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And they put <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and lighted up the lamps that were upon the candlestick, and they gave light in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And they set the loaves upon the table, and hung up the veils, and finished all the works that they had begun to make.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And they arose before the morning on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, (which is the month of Casleu) in the hundred and forty-eighth year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And they offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, according to the law, upon the new <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ia">altar of holocausts</a> which they had made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> According to the time, and according to the day wherein the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> had defiled it, in the same was it <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> anew with canticles, and harps, and lutes, and cymbals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And all the people fell upon their faces, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, him that had prospered them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And they kept the <a href="../cathen/04673b.htm">dedication of the altar</a> eight days, and they offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and of praise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And they adorned the front of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> with crowns of gold, and escutcheons, and they renewed the gates, and the chambers, and hanged doors upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And there was exceeding great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> among the people, and the reproach of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> was turned away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and his brethren, and all the church of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> decreed, that the <a href="../cathen/04673b.htm">day of the dedication of the altar</a> should be kept in its season from year to year for eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu, with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy and gladness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> They built up also at that time Mount Sion, with high walls, and strong towers round about, lest the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should at any time come, and tread it down, as they did before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And he placed a garrison there, to keep it, and he fortified it, to secure Bethsura, that the people might have a defence against <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumea</a>.</span></p>
