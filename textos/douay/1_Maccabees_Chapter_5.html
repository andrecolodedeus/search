<div class="h1a">Judas and his brethren attack the enemies of their country, and deliver them that were distressed. Josephus and Azarius, attempting contrary to order to fight against their enemies, are defeated.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now it came to pass, when the nations round about heard that the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> and the sanctuary were built up, as before, that they were exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they thought to destroy the <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a> that were among them, and they began to kill some of the people, and to persecute them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> fought against the children of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> in <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumea</a>, and them that were in Acrabathane: because they beset the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> round about, and he made a great slaughter of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he remembered the malice of the children of Bean: who were a snare and a stumbling block to the people, by lying in wait for them in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they were shut up by him in towers, and he set upon them, and devoted them to utter destruction, and burnt their towers with fire, and all that were in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then he passed over to the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, where he found a mighty power, and much people, and Timotheus was their <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he fought many battles with them, and they were discomfited in their sight, and he smote them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he took the city of Gazer and her towns, and returned into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> that were in Galaad, assembled themselves together against the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> that were in their quarters, to destroy them: and they fled into the fortress of Datheman.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they sent <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and his brethren, saying: The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> that are round about are gathered together against us to destroy us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they are preparing to come, and to take the fortress into which we are fled: and Timotheus is the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of their host.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now therefore come, and deliver us out of their hands, for many of us are slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And all our brethren that were in the places of Tubin, are killed: and they have carried away their wives, and their children, captives, and taken their spoils, and they have slain there almost a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And while they were yet reading these <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>, behold there came other messengers out of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> with their garments rent, who related according to these words:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Saying, that they of <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a>, were assembled against them, and all <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> is filled with strangers, in order to consume us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and the people heard these words, a great assembly met together to consider what they should do for their brethren that were in trouble, and were assaulted by them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> said to Simon, his brother: Choose thee <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and go, and deliver thy brethren in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>: and I, and my brother <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, will go into the country of Galaad:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he left Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the people, with the remnant of the army in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, to keep it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he commanded them, saying: Take ye the charge of this people; but make no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, till we return.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were allotted to Simon, to go into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>: and eight thousand to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, to go into the land of Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Simon went into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and fought many battles with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> were discomfited before his face, and he pursued them even to the gate of <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And there fell of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> almost three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and he took the spoils of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he took with him those that were in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and in Arbatis, with their wives, and children, and all that they had, and he brought them into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, his brother, passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and went three days' journey through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the Nabutheans met them, and received them in a peaceable manner, and told them all that happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And that many of them were shut up in Barasa, and in Bosor, and in Alima, and in Casphor, and in Mageth, and in Carnaim; all these strong and great cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Yea, and that they were kept shut up in the rest of the cities of Galaad, and that they had appointed to bring their army on the morrow near to these cities, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his army suddenly turned their march into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, to Bosor, and took the city: and he slew every male by the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burnt it with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they removed from thence by night, and went till they came to the fortress.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And it came to pass that early in the morning, when they lifted up their eyes, behold there were people without number, carrying ladders and engines to take the fortress, and assault them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> saw that the fight was begun, and the cry of the battle went up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> like a trumpet, and a great cry out of the city:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he said to his host: Fight ye today for your brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he came with three companies behind them, and they sounded their trumpets, and cried out in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the host of Timotheus understood that it was <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, and they fled away before his face and they made a great slaughter of them, and there fell of them in that day almost eight thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> turned aside to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>, and assaulted, and took it, and he slew every male thereof, and took the spoils thereof, and burnt it with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> From thence he marched, and took Casbon, and Mageth, and Bosor, and the rest of the cities of Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But after this Timotheus gathered another army, and camped over against Raphon, beyond the torrent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> sent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to view the army: and they brought him word, saying: All the nations, that are round about us, are assembled unto him an army exceeding great:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And they have hired the Arabians to help them, and they have pitched their tents beyond the torrent, ready to come to fight against thee. And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> went to meet them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And Timotheus said to the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of his army: When <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his army come near the torrent of water, if he pass over unto us first, we shall not be able to withstand him: for he will certainly prevail over us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But if he be afraid to pass over, and camp on the other side of the river, we will pass over to them, and shall prevail against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> came near the torrent of water, he set the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> of the people by the torrent, and commanded them, saying: Suffer no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to stay behind: but let all come to the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And he passed over to them first, and all the people after him, and all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> were discomfited before them, and they threw away their weapons, and fled to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> that was in Carnaim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he took that city, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> he burnt with fire, with all things that were therein: and Carnaim was subdued, and could not stand against the face of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> gathered together all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> that were in the land of Galaad, from the least even to the greatest, and their wives and children, and an army exceeding great, to come into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And they came as far as Ephron: now this was a great city, situate in the way, strongly fortified, and there was no means to turn from it on the right hand or on the left, but the way was through the midst of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And they that were in the city shut themselves in, and stopped up the gates with stones: and <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> sent to them with peaceable words,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Saying: Let us pass through your land, to go into our own country, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall hurt you; we will only pass through on foot. But they would not open to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> commanded proclamation to be made in the camp, that they should make an assault, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the place where he was.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the army drew near, and he assaulted that city all the day, and all the night; and the city was delivered into his hands:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And they slew every male with the edge of the sword, and he razed the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through all the city over them that were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Then they passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> to the great plain that is over against <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> gathered together the hindmost, and he exhorted the people, all the way through, till they came into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And they went up to mount Sion with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy and gladness</a>, and offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, because not one of them was slain, till they had returned in peace.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> Now in the days that <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, before <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the soldiers, heard of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> success, and the battles that were fought,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And he said: Let us also get us a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and let us go fight against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> that are round about us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And he gave charge to them that were in his army, and they went towards Jamnia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And Gorgias and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went out of the city, to give them battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And Joseph and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued unto the borders of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>: and there fell on that day, of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, about two thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and there was a great overthrow of the people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> Because they did not hearken to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his brethren, thinking that they should do manfully.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> But they were not of the seed of those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by whom <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was brought to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> were magnified exceedingly in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and of all the nations where their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> And the people assembled to them with joyful acclamations.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his brethren went forth and attacked the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">children of Esau</a>, in the land towards the south, and he took Chebron and her towns: and he burnt the walls thereof, and the towers all round it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And he removed his camp to go into the land of the aliens, and he went through <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> In that day some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> fell in battle, while desiring to do manfully they went out unadvisedly to fight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> turned to <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, into the land of the strangers, and he threw down their <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, and he burnt the statues of their gods with fire: and he took the spoils of the cities, and returned into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span></p>
