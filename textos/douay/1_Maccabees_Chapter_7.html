<h1>1 Maccabees Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">Demetrius is made king, and sends Bacchides and Alcimus the priest into Judea, and after them Nicanor, who is slain by Judas with all his army.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the hundred and fifty-first year, Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, departed from the city of Rome, and came up with few <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> into a city of the sea coast, and reigned there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And it came to pass as he entered into the house of the kingdom of his fathers, that the army seized upon Antiochus, and Lysias, to bring them unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when he knew it, he said: Let me not see their face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So the army slew them. And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom:</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And there came to him the wicked and ungodly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> was at the head of them, who desired to be made <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they accused the people to the king, saying: <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his brethren have destroyed all thy friends, and he hath driven us out of our land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now, therefore, send some man whom thou trustest, and let him go, and see all the havoc he hath made amongst us, and in the king's lands: and let him punish all his friends and their helpers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then the king chose Bacchides, one of his friends, that ruled beyond the great river in the kingdom, and was faithful to the king: and he sent him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> To see the havoc that <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> had made: and the wicked <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> he made <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and commanded him to take revenge upon the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they arose, and came with a great army into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and they sent messengers, and spoke to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his brethren with peaceable words, deceitfully.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But they gave no heed to their words: for they saw that they were come with a great army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then there assembled to <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> and Bacchides a company of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, to require things that are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And first the <a href="../cathen/01800b.htm">Assideans</a>, that were among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and they sought peace of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For they said: One that is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> is come, he will not deceive us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he spoke to them peaceably: and he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to them, saying: We will do you no harm, nor your friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him. And he took threescore of them, and slew them in one day, according to the word that is written:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The flesh of thy saints, and the blood of them they have shed round about <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and there was none to bury them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then fear and trembling fell upon all the people: for they said: There is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> among them: for they have broken the covenant, and the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which they made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Bacchides removed the camp from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and pitched in Bethzecha: and he sent, and took many of them that were fled away from him, and some of the people he killed, and threw them into a great pit.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Then he committed the country to <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a>, and left with him troops to help him. So Bacchides went away to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> did what he could to maintain his chief <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they that disturbed the people resorted to him, and they got the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> into their power, and did much hurt in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> saw all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a>, and they that were with him, did to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, much more than the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he went out into all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> round about, and took vengeance upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that had revolted, and they ceased to go forth any more into the country.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> saw that <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and they that were with him, prevailed: and he knew that he could not stand against them, and he went back to the king, and accused them of many crimes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the king sent Nicanor, one of his principal lords, who was a great enemy to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and he commanded him to destroy the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Nicanor came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with a great army, and he sent to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and to his brethren deceitfully, with friendly words,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Saying: Let there be no fighting between me and you: I will come with a few <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to see your faces with peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he came to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and they saluted one another peaceably: and the enemies were prepared to take away <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> by force.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the thing was known to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> that he was come to him with deceit: and he was much afraid of him, and would not see his face any more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And Nicanor knew that his counsel was discovered: and he went out to fight against <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, near Capharsalama.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And there fell of Nicanor's army almost five thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they fled into the city of David.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And after this Nicanor went up into mount Sion: and some of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the people came out to salute him peaceably, and to show him the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> that were offered for the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But he mocked and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> them, and abused them: and he spoke <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, saying: Unless <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his army be delivered into my hands, as soon as ever I return in peace, I will burn this house. And he went out in a great rage.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> went in, and stood before the face of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and weeping, they said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, hast chosen this house for thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> to be called upon therein, that it might be a house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication for thy people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Be avenged of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and his army, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Then Nicanor went out from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and encamped near to Bethoron: and an army of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> joined him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> pitched in Adarsa with three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, when they that were sent by king Sennacherib <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> thee, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> went out, and slew of them a hundred and eighty-five thousand:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Even so destroy this army in our sight today and let the rest know that he hath spoken ill against thy sanctuary: and judge thou him according to his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And the armies joined battle on the thirteenth day of the month, <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a>: and the army of Nicanor was defeated, and he himself was first slain in the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And when his army saw that Nicanor was slain they threw away their weapons, and fled:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And they pursued after them one day's journey from Adazer, even till ye come to Gazara, and they sounded the trumpets after them with signals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And they went forth out of all the towns of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> round about, and they pushed them with the horns, and they turned again to them, and they were all slain with the sword, and there was not left of them so much as one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And they took the spoils of them for a booty, and they cut off Nicanor's head, and his right hand, which he had <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a> stretched out, and they brought it, and hung it up over against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And the people rejoiced exceedingly, and they spent that day with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And he ordained that this day should be kept every year, being the thirteenth of the month of <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> was quiet for a short time.</span></p>
