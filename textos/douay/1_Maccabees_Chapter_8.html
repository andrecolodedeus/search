<h1>1 Maccabees Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="h1a">Judas hears of the great character of the Romans: he makes a league with them.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> heard of the fame of the Romans, that they are powerful and strong, and willingly agree to all things that are requested of them: and that whosoever have come to them, they have made amity with them, and that they are mighty in power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they heard of their battles, and their noble acts which they had done in Galatia, how they had conquered them, and brought them under tribute: <span class="stiki"><strong>They heard, etc...</strong> What is here set down of the history and character of the ancient Romans, is not an assertion, or affirmation of the sacred writer: but only a relation of what <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> had heard of them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And how great things they had done in the land of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and that they had brought under their power the mines of silver and of gold that are there, and had gotten possession of all the place by their counsel and patience:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And had conquered places that were very far off from them, and kings that came against them from the ends of the earth, and had overthrown them with great slaughter: and the rest pay them tribute every year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And that they had defeated in battle Philip and Perses the king of the Ceteans, and the rest that had borne arms against them, and had conquered them: <span class="stiki"><strong>Ceteans...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonians</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And how Antiochus, the great king of Asia, who went to fight against them, having a hundred and twenty elephants, with horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army, was routed by them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And how they took him alive, and appointed to him, that both he and they that should reign after him, should pay a great tribute, and that he should give hostages, and that which was agreed upon,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the country of the Indians, and of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>, and of the Lydians, some of their best provinces: and those which they had taken from them, they gave to king Eumenes. <span class="stiki"><strong>Eumenes...</strong> King of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamus</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And that they who were in Greece, had a mind to go and to destroy them: and they had knowledge thereof,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they sent a general against them, and fought with them, and many of them were slain, and they carried away their wives, and their children captives, and spoiled them, and took possession of their land, and threw down their walls, and brought them to be their servants unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the other kingdoms, and islands, that at any time had resisted them, they had destroyed and brought under their power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But with their friends, and such as relied upon them, they kept amity, and had conquered kingdoms that were near, and that were far off: for all that heard their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, were afraid of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> That whom they had a mind to help to a kingdom, those reigned: and whom they would, they deposed from a kingdom: and they were greatly exalted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And none of all these wore a crown, or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And that they had made themselves a senate house, and consulted daily three hundred and twenty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that sat in council always for the people, that they might do the things that were right:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And that they committed their government to one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> every year, to rule over all their country, and they all <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> one, and there is no envy nor jealousy amongst them. <span class="stiki"><strong>To one man...</strong> There were two consuls: but one only ruled at one time, each in his day. -- Ibid. <strong>No envy, etc...</strong> So <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> had heard: and it was so far <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, with regard to the ancient Romans, that as yet no <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> or jealousy had divided them into such open factions and civil wars, as they afterwards experienced in the time of Marius and Sylla, etc.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> chose Eupolemus, the son of John, the son of Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a>, and he sent them to Rome to make a league of amity and confederacy with them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And that they might take off from them the yoke of the Grecians, for they saw that they oppressed the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with servitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they went to Rome, a very long journey, and they entered into the senate house, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>, and his brethren, and the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, have sent us to you to make alliance and peace with you, and that we may be registered your confederates and friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the proposal was pleasing in their sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And this is the copy of the writing that they wrote back again, graven in tables of brass, and sent to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, that it might be with them there for a memorial of the peace, and alliance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> GOOD SUCCESS BE TO THE ROMANS, and to the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by sea, and by land, for ever: and far be the sword and enemy from them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But if there come first any <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon the Romans, or any of their confederates, in all their dominions:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> shall help them according as the time shall direct, with all their heart:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Neither shall they give them, whilst they are fighting, or furnish them with wheat, or arms, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the Romans: and they shall <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their orders, without taking any thing of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> In like manner also if <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> shall come first upon the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according as the time shall permit them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And there shall not be given to them that come to their aid, either wheat, or arms, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the Romans: and they shall observe their orders without deceit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> According to these articles did the Romans covenant with the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And, if after this, one party or the other shall have a mind to add to these articles, or take away any thing, they may do it at their pleasure: and whatsoever they shall add, or take away, shall be ratified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Moreover, concerning the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that Demetrius, the king, hath done against them, we have written to him, saying: Why hast thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and allies, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> If, therefore, they come again to us complaining of thee, we will do them <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and will make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against thee by sea and land.</span></p>
