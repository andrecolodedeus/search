<h1>1 Maccabees Chapter 9</h1>
<div class="h1a">Bacchides is sent again into Judea: Judas fights against him with eight hundred men and is slain. Jonathan succeeds him and revenges the murder of his brother John. He fights against Bacchides. Alcimus dies miserably. Bacchides besieges Bethbessen. He is forced to raise the siege and leave the country.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the mean time, when Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his army were fallen in battle, he sent again Bacchides and <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>; and the right wing of his army with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they took the road that leadeth to Galgal, and they camped in Masaloth, which is in Arabella: and they made themselves masters of it, and slew many people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> In the first month of the hundred and fifty-second year they brought the army to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they arose and went to Berea, with twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and two thousand horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> had pitched his tents in Laisa, and three thousand chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they saw the multitude of the army that they were many, and they were seized with great fear: and many withdrew themselves out of the camp, and there remained of them no more than eight hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> saw that his army slipped away, and the battle pressed upon him, and his heart was cast down: because he had not time to gather them together, and he was discouraged.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then he said to them that remained: Let us arise, and go against our enemies, if we may be able to fight against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But they dissuaded him, saying: We shall not be able, but let us save our lives now, and return to our brethren, and then we will fight against them: for we are but few.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid we should do this thing, and flee away from them: but if our time be come, let us die manfully for our brethren, and let us not stain our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the army removed out of the camp, and they stood over against them: and the horsemen were divided into two troops, and the slingers, and the archers, went before the army, and they that were in the front were all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of valour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Bacchides was in the right wing, and the legion drew near on two sides, and they sounded the trumpets:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they also that were on <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas'</a> side, even they also cried out, and the earth shook at the noise of the armies: and the battle was fought from morning even unto the evening.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> perceived that the stronger part of the army of Bacchides was on the right side, and all the stout of heart came together with him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the right wing was discomfited by them, and he pursued them even to the <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">mount Azotus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they that were in the left wing saw that the right wing was discomfited, and they followed after <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and them that were with him, at their back:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the battle was hard fought, and there fell many wounded of the one side and of the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> was slain, and the rest fled away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and Simon took <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of their fathers, in the city of Modin.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> bewailed him with great lamentation, and they mourned for him many days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And said: How is the mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fallen, that saved the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But the rest of the words of the wars of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and of the noble acts that he did, and of his greatness, are not written: for they were very many.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And it came to pass, after the death of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, that the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the confines of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and all the workers of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> rose up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> In those days there was a very great famine, and they and all their country yielded to Bacchides.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And Bacchides chose the wicked <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and made them lords of the country:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they sought out, and made diligent search after the friends of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and brought them to Bacchides, and he took vengeance of them, and abused them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And there was a great tribulation in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, such as was not since the day, that there was no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> seen in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And all the friends of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> came together, and said to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Since thy brother <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> died there is not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> like him to go forth against our enemies, Bacchides, and them that are the enemies of our nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Now, therefore, we have chosen thee this day to be our prince, and <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>, in his stead, to fight our battles.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> took upon him the government at that time, and rose up in the place of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, his brother,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And Bacchides had knowledge of it, and sought to kill him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and Simon, his brother, knew it, and all that were with them: and they fled into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Thecua, and they pitched by the water of the lake Asphar,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And Bacchides understood it, and he came himself, with all his army, over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> sent his brother, a <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the people, to desire the Nabutheans his friends, that they would lend them their equipage, which was copious.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the children of Jambri came forth out of Madaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went away with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> After this it was told <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and Simon, his brother, that the children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing the bride out of Madaba, the daughter of one of the great princes of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, with great pomp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And they remembered the blood of John, their brother: and they went up, and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And they lifted up their eyes, and saw: and behold a tumult, and great preparation: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends, and his brethren to meet them with timbrels, and musical instruments and many weapons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they rose up against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and slew them, and there fell many wounded, and the rest fled into the mountains, and they took all their spoils:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And the marriage was turned into mourning, and the noise of their musical instruments into lamentation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And they took revenge for the blood of their brother: and they returned to the bank of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And Bacchides heard it, and he came on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a> even to the bank of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, with a great power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said to his company: Let us arise, and fight against our enemies: for it is not now as yesterday, and the day before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> For behold the battle is before us, and the water of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> on this side and on that side, and banks, and marshes, and woods: and there is no place for us to turn aside.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Now, therefore, cry ye to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, that ye may be delivered from the hand of your enemies. And they joined battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> stretched forth his hand to strike Bacchides, but he turned away from him backwards.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and they that were with him, leapt into the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and swam over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And there fell of Bacchides' side that day a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and they returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And they built strong cities in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, the fortress that was in <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and in Ammaus, and in Bethoron, and in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and Thamnata, and Phara, and Thopo, with high walls, and gates, and bars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And he placed garrisons in them, that they might wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And he fortified the city of Bethsura, and Gazara, and the castle, and set garrisons in them, and provisions of victuals:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And he took the sons of the chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the country for hostages, and put them in the castle in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in custody.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Now in the year one hundred and fifty-three, the second month, <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> commanded the walls of the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the sanctuary to be thrown down, and the works of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to be destroyed: and he began to destroy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> was struck: and his works were hindered, and his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak a word, nor give order concerning his house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> died at that time in great torment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And Bacchides saw that <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> was dead: and he returned to the king, and the land was quiet for two years.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And all the wicked held a council, saying: Behold <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and they that are with him, dwell at ease and without fear: now, therefore, let us bring Bacchides hither, and he shall take them all in one night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> So they went, and gave him counsel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And he arose to come with a great army: and he sent secretly <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to his adherents that were in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> to seize upon <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and them that were with him: but they could not, for their design was known to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And he apprehended of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the country, that were the principal authors of the mischief, fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and he slew them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and Simon, and they that were with him, retired into Bethbessen, which is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: and he repaired the breaches thereof, and they fortified it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> And when Bacchides knew it, he gathered together all his multitude: and sent word to them that were of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> And he came, and camped above Bethbessen, and fought against it many days, and made engines.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> But <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> left his brother, Simon, in the city and went forth into the country, and came with a number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And struck Odares, and his brethren, and the children of Phaseron, in their tents, and he began to slay, and to increase in forces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> But Simon, and they that were with him, sallied out of the city, and burnt the engines,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> And they fought against Bacchides, and he was discomfited by them: and they afflicted him exceedingly, for his counsel, and his enterprise was in vain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> And he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the wicked <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that had given him counsel to come into their country, and he slew many of them: and he purposed to return with the rest into their country.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse70">70</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> had knowledge of it, and he sent ambassadors to him to make peace with him, and to restore to him the prisoners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse71">71</span> And he accepted it willingly, and did according to his words, and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> that he would do him no harm all the days of his life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse72">72</span> And he restored to him the prisoners which he before had taken out of the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and he returned, and went away into his own country, and he came no more into their borders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse73">73</span> So the sword ceased from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> dwelt in Machmas, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> began there to judge the people, and he destroyed the wicked out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
