<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> If so be you have tasted that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> is sweet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> but chosen and made <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, to offer up spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Wherefore it is said in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner stone</a>, <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, precious.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For this is thankworthy: if, for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For what <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is it, if, committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and being buffeted for it, you endure?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For unto this are you called: because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was guile found in his mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Who, when he was <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">reviled</a>, did not <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">revile</a>: when he <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">suffered</a>, he threatened not, but delivered himself to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">him</a> that judged him <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Who his own self bore our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, should live to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: by whose stripes you were healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For you were as sheep going astray: but you are now <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">shepherd and bishop</a> of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span></p>
