<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In like manner also, let wives be subject to their husbands: that, if any <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Considering your <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chaste</a> conversation with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the <a href="../cathen/07113a.htm">hair</a>, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the hidden <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For after this manner heretofore, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also who trusted in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> As <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well and not fearing any disturbance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, giving <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the co-heirs of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of life: that your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> be not hindered.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Not rendering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">railing</a> for <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">railing</a>, but contrariwise, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For he that will love life and see <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> days, let him refrain his tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and his lips that they speak no guile.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Let him decline from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: Let him seek after peace and pursue it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Because the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> are upon the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and his ears unto their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> but the countenance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> upon them that do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And who is he that can hurt you, if you be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But if also you suffer any thing for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice'</a> sake, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> are ye. And be not afraid of their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: and be not troubled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But sanctify the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Christ</a> in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> which is in you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But with modesty and fear, having a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: that whereas they speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of you, they may be ashamed who <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accuse your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> conversation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For it is better doing well (if such be the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) to suffer than doing ill.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also died once for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,</span>
