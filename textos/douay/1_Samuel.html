<h1>1 Samuel</h1>

<h2>The First Book of Samuel, also called the First Book of Kings</h2>

<p>This and the following book are called by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a> the <em>Books of Samuel</em>, because they contain the history of Samuel, and of the two kings, <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">David</a>, whom he anointed. They are more commonly named by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, the <em>First and Second Book of Kings</em>. As to the writer of them, it is the common opinion that Samuel composed the first book, as far as the <a href="../douay/1sa025.htm">twenty-fifth chapter</a>; and that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> and <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a> finished the first, and wrote the second book. See <a href="../douay/1ch029.htm#verse29">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08647b.htm">FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/1sa001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> Anna the wife of Elcana being barren, by vow and prayer obtaineth a son: whom she calleth Samuel: and presenteth him to the service of God in Silo, according to her vow:
<br><a href="../douay/1sa002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> The canticle of Anna. The wickedness of the sons of Heli: for which they are not duly corrected by their father. A prophecy against the house of Heli.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> Samuel is four times called by the Lord: who revealeth to him the evil that shall fall on Heli, and his house.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> The Israelites being overcome by the Philistines, send for the ark of God: but they are beaten again, the sons of Heli are killed, and the ark taken: upon the hearing of the news Heli falleth backward and dieth.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> Dagon twice falleth down before the ark. The Philistines are grievously afflicted, wherever the ark cometh.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> The ark is sent back to Bethsames: where many are slain for looking through curiosity into it.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> The ark is brought to Cariathiarim. By Samuel's exhortation the people cast away their idols and serve God alone. The Lord defeateth the Philistines, while Samuel offereth sacrifice.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> Samuel growing old, and his sons not walking in his ways, the people desire a king.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> Saul seeking his father's asses, cometh to Samuel, by whom he is entertained.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> Saul is anointed. He prophesieth, and is changed into another man. Samuel calleth the people together, to make a king: the lot falleth on Saul.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> Saul defeateth the Ammonites, and delivereth Jabes Galaad.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> Samuel's integrity is acknowledged. God showeth by a sign from heaven that they had done ill in asking for a king.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> The war between Saul and the Philistines. The distress of the Israelites. Saul offereth sacrifice before the coming of Samuel: for which he is reproved.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> Jonathan attacketh the Philistines. A miraculous victory. Saul's unadvised oath, by which Jonathan is put in danger of his life, but is delivered by the people.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> Saul is sent to destroy Amalec: he spareth their king and the best of their cattle: for which disobedience he is cast off by the Lord.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> Samuel is sent to Bethlehem, where he anointeth David: who is taken into Saul's family.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> War with the Philistines. Goliath challengeth Israel. He is slain by David.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> The friendship of Jonathan and David. The envy of Saul, and his design upon David's life. He marrieth him to his daughter Michol.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> Other attempts of Saul upon David's life. He cometh to Samuel. Saul's messengers, and Saul himself prophesy.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> Saul being obstinately bent upon killing David, he is sent away by Jonathan.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> David receiveth holy bread of Achimelech, the priest: and feigneth himself mad before Achis, king of Geth.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> Many resort to David. Doeg accuseth Achimelech to Saul. He ordereth him and all the other priests of Nobe to be slain. Abiathar escapeth.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa023.htm"><strong>Chapter 23.</strong></a> David relieveth Ceila, besieged by the Philistines. He fleeth into the desert of Ziph. Jonathan and he confirm their former covenant. The Ziphites discover him to Saul, who pursuing close after him, is called away by an invasion from the Philistines.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa024.htm"><strong>Chapter 24.</strong></a> Saul seeketh David in the wilderness of Engaddi: he goeth into a cave where David hath him in his power.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa025.htm"><strong>Chapter 25.</strong></a> The death of Samuel. David, provoked by Nabal, threateneth to destroy him: but is appeased by Abigail.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa026.htm"><strong>Chapter 26.</strong></a> Saul goeth out again after David, who cometh by night where Saul and his men are asleep, but suffereth him not to be touched. Saul again confesseth his fault, and promiseth peace.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa027.htm"><strong>Chapter 27.</strong></a> David goeth again to Achis king of Geth, and obtaineth of him the city of Siceleg.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa028.htm"><strong>Chapter 28.</strong></a> The Philistines go out to war against Israel. Saul being forsaken by God, hath recourse to a witch. Samuel appeareth to him.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa029.htm"><strong>Chapter 29.</strong></a> David going with the Philistines is sent back by their princes.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa030.htm"><strong>Chapter 30.</strong></a> The Amalecites burn Siceleg, and carry off the prey: David pursueth after them, and recovereth all out of their hands.
<br><a href="../douay/1sa031.htm"><strong>Chapter 31.</strong></a> Israel is defeated by the Philistines: Saul and his sons are slain.
