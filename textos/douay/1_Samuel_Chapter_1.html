<div class="h1a">Anna the wife of Elcana being barren, by vow and prayer obtains a son: whom she calls Samuel: and presents him to the service of God in Silo, according to her vow:</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> There was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of Ramathaimsophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraimite: <span class="stiki"><strong>An Ephraimite...</strong> He was of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">tribe of Levi</a>, <a href="../douay/1ch006.htm#verse34">1 Chronicles 6:34</a>, but is called an Ephraimite from dwelling in mount Ephraim.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he had two wives, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of one was <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> had no children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went up out of his city upon the appointed days, to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> and to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> in Silo. And the two sons of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, Ophni and Phinees, were there <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now the day came, and Elcana offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and gave to Phenenna, his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But to <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> he gave one portion with sorrow, because he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had shut up her womb.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Her rival also afflicted her, and troubled her exceedingly, insomuch that she upbraided her, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had shut up her womb:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And thus she did every year, when the time returned, that they went up to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>: and thus she provoked her: but <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> wept, and did not eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then Elcana, her husband, said to her: <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a>, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? and why dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo: And <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, sitting upon a stool before the door of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> As <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> had her heart full of grief, she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, shedding many tears,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And she made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, saying: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, if thou wilt look down, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a manchild: I will give him to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it came to pass, as she multiplied <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> observed her mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> therefore thought her to be drunk,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And said to her: How long wilt thou be drunk? digest a little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> said to her: Go in peace: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And she said: Would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> thy handmaid may find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in thy eyes. So the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> went on her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more changed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they rose in the morning, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipped</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And Elcana knew <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> his wife: And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> remembered her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And it came to pass when the time was come about, <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> conceived and bore a son, and called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Samuel: because she had asked him of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Samuel...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> imports, asked of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Elcana, her husband, went up, and all his house, to offer to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> went not up: for she said to her husband: I will not go till the child be weaned, and till I may carry him, that he may appear before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and may abide always there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Elcana, her husband, said to her: Do what seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may fulfil his word. So the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> staid at home, and gave her son suck, till she weaned him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And after she had weaned him, she carried him with her, with three calves, and three bushels of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> in Silo. Now the child was as yet very young:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> liveth, my lord: I am that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who stood before thee here <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For this child did I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath granted me my petition, which I asked of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Therefore I also have lent him to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> all the days of his life, he shall be lent to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> there. And <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and said:</span></p>
