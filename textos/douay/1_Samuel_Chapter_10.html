<div class="h1a">Saul is anointed. He prophesies, and is changed into another man. Samuel calls the people together, to make a king: the lot falls on Saul.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Samuel took a little vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him, and said: Behold, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance, and thou shalt deliver his people out of the hands of their enemies, that are round about them. And this shall be a sign unto thee, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath anointed thee to be prince.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> When thou shalt depart from me this day, thou shalt find two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the sepulchre of <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> in the borders of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> to the south, and they shall say to thee: The asses are found which thou wentest to seek: and thy father, thinking no more of the asses, is concerned for you, and saith: What shall I do for my son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when thou shalt depart from thence, and go farther on, and shalt come to the oak of <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Thabor</a>, there shall meet thee three <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> going up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, one carrying three kids, and another three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine. <span class="stiki"><strong>Bethel...</strong> Where there was at that time an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it being one of the places where Samuel judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they will salute thee, and will give thee two loaves, and thou shalt take them at their hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> After that thou shalt come to the hill of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where the garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> is: and when thou shalt be come there into the city, thou shalt meet a company of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> coming down from the high place, with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp before them, and they shall be <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The hill of God...</strong> Gabaa, in which there was also at that time, a high place or <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>. <strong>Prophets...</strong> These were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whose office it was to sing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for such in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">holy writ</a> are called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and their singing praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a>. See <a href="../douay/1ch015.htm#verse22">1 Chronicles 15:22</a>, and <a href="../douay/1ch025.htm#verse1">25:1</a>. Now there were in those days colleges, or schools for training up these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and it seems there was one of these schools at this hill of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and another at Najoth in Ramatha. See 1 Samuel <a href="../douay/1sa019.htm#verse20">19:20-21</a>, etc.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> shall come upon thee, and thou shalt <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> with them, and shalt be changed into another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> When therefore these signs shall happen to thee, do whatsoever thy hand shall find, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And thou shalt go down before me to Galgal, (for I will come down to thee), that thou mayst offer an <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> victims of peace: seven days shalt thou wait, till I come to thee, and I will show thee what thou art to do. <span class="stiki"><strong>Galgal...</strong> Here also by dispensation was an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave unto him another heart, and all these things came to pass that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they came to the foresaid hill, and behold a company of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> met him: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon him, and he <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> in the midst of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And all that had known him yesterday and the day before, seeing that he was with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a>, said to each other: What is this that hath happened to the son of Cis? is <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> also among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And one answered another, saying: And who is their father? therefore it became a proverb: Is <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> also among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? <span class="stiki"><strong>Their father...</strong> That is, their teacher, or superior. As much as to say, Who could bring about such a wonderful change as to make <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>?</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when he had made an end of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a>, he came to the high place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> uncle said to him, and to his servant: Whither went you? They answered: To seek the asses: and not finding them, we went to Samuel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And his uncle said to him: Tell me what Samuel said to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to his uncle: He told us that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken to him, he told him not.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Samuel called together the people to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: I brought up <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and delivered you from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, and from the hand of all the kings who afflicted you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But you this day have rejected your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who only hath saved you out of all your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and your tribulations: and you have said: Nay: but set a king over us. Now therefore stand before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> by your <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>, and by your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Samuel brought to him all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, and the lot fell on the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he brought the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a> and the kindreds thereof, and the lot fell upon the kindred of Metri, and it came to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, the son of Cis. They sought him therefore, and he was not found.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And after this they consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> whether he would come thither. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> answered: Behold he is hidden at home.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they ran and fetched him thence: and he stood in the midst of the people, and he was higher than any of the people from the shoulders and upward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Samuel said to all the people: Surely you see him whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people. And all the people cried and said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And Samuel told the people the law of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and Samuel sent away all the people, every one to his own house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> also departed to his own house in Gabaa: and there went with him a part of the army, whose hearts <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had touched.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But the children of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> said: Shall this fellow be able to save us? And they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> him, and brought him no presents; but he dissembled as though he heard not.</span></p>
