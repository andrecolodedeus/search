<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">Saul defeats the Ammonites, and delivers Jabesh Gilead.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass about a month after this, that Naas, the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonite</a>, came up, and began to fight against Jabes Galaad. And all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jabes said to Naas: Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Naas, the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonite</a>, answered them: On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may pluck out all your right eyes, and make you a reproach in all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the ancients of Jabes said to him: Allow us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and if there be no one to defend us, we will come out to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The messengers therefore came to Gabaa of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and they spoke these words in the hearing of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And behold <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> came, following oxen out of the field, and he said: What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jabes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, when he had heard these words, and his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> was exceedingly kindled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And taking both the oxen, he cut them in pieces, and sent them into all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, by messengers, saying: Whosoever shall not come forth, and follow <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> fell upon the people, and they went out as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he numbered them in Bezec: and there were of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> three hundred thousand: and of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">men of Juda</a> thirty thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they said to the messengers that came: Thus shall you say to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jabes Galaad: Tomorrow, when the sun shall be hot, you shall have relief. The messengers therefore came, and told the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jabes, and they were glad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they said: In the morning we will come out to you: and you shall do what you please with us.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it came to pass, when the morrow was come, that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> put the people in three companies: and he came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and he slew the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a> until the day grew hot, and the rest were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the people said to Samuel: Who is he that said: Shall <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> reign over us? Bring the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and we will kill them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be killed this day: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> this day hath wrought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Samuel said to the people: Come, and let us go to Galgal, and let us renew the kingdom there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And all the people went to Galgal, and there they made <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> king, before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in Galgal, and they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> there victims of peace before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And there <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> rejoiced exceedingly.</span></p>
