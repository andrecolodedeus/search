<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Samuel said to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold I have hearkened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And now the king goeth before you: but I am old and greyheaded: and my sons are with you: having then conversed with you from my youth until this day, behold here I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Speak of me before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and before his anointed, whether I have taken any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ox, or ass: if I have wronged any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if I have oppressed any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if I have taken a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> at any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hand: and I will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> it this day, and will restore it to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they said: Thou hast not wronged us, nor oppressed us, nor taken ought at any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to them: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found any thing in my hand. And they said: He is witness.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Samuel said to the people: It is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> who made <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and brought our fathers out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now, therefore, stand up, that I may plead in judgment against you before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, concerning all the kindness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he hath shown to you, and to your fathers:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> How <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> went into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and your fathers cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and brought your fathers out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and made them dwell in this place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they forgot the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he delivered them into the hands of Sisara, <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the army of Hasor, and into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and into the hand of the king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and they fought against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But afterwards they cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, because we have forsaken the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and have served <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a> and Astaroth: but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Badan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>, and Samuel, and delivered you from the hand of your enemies round about, and you dwelt securely. <span class="stiki"><strong>Jerobaal and Badan...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> and <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> called here Badan or Bedan, because he was of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But seeing that Naas, king of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, was come against you, you said to me: Nay, but a king shall reign over us: whereas the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> was your king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now, therefore, your king is here, whom you have chosen and desired: Behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given you a king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> If you will fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and not provoke the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: then shall both you, and the king who reigneth over you, be followers of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But if you will not hearken to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but will rebel against his words, the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall be upon you, and upon your fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now then stand, and see this great thing which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will do in your sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he shall send thunder and rain: and you shall know, and see that you yourselves have done a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, in desiring a king over you. <span class="stiki"><strong>Wheat harvest...</strong> At which time of the year, it never thunders or rains in those countries.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Samuel cried unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent thunder and rain that day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And all the people greatly feared the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and Samuel. And all the people said to Samuel: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> for thy servants to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, that we may not die, for we have added to all our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to ask for a king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Samuel said to the people: Fear not, you have done all this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: but yet depart not from following the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with all your heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And turn not aside after vain things, which shall never profit you, nor deliver you, because they are vain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will not forsake his people for his great <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to make you his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And far from me be this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that I should cease to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you: and I will teach you the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and right way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Therefore fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and serve him in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and with your whole heart, for you have seen the great works which he hath done among you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But if you will still do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>: both you and your king shall perish together.</span></p>
