<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was a child of one year when he began to reign, and he reigned two years over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of one year...</strong> That is, he was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and like an innocent child, and for two years continued in that innocency.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> chose him three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and two thousand were with <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> in Machmas, and in mount <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>: and a thousand with <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> in Gabaa of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>: and the rest of the people he sent back every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to their dwellings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> smote the garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> which was in Gabaa. And when the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had heard of it, <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sounded the trumpet over all the land, saying: Let the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> heard this report: <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> hath smitten the garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. And the people were called together after <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> to Galgal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> also were assembled to fight against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and a multitude of people besides, like the sand on the seashore for number. And going up they camped in Machmas, at the east of Bethaven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> saw that they were straitened (for the people were distressed), they hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in dens, and in pits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And some of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> into the land of <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a> and Galaad. And when <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was yet in Galgal, all the people that followed him were greatly afraid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he waited seven days, according to the appointment of Samuel, and Samuel came not to Galgal, and the people slipt away from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: Bring me the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and the peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>. And he offered the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when he had made an end of <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, behold Samuel came: and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> went forth to meet him and salute him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Samuel said to him: What hast thou done? <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> answered: Because I saw that the people slipt from me, and thou wast not come according to the days appointed, and the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were gathered together in Machmas,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I said: Now will the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> come down upon me to Galgal, and I have not appeased the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Forced by necessity, I offered the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Samuel said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Thou hast done foolishly, and hast not kept the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, which he commanded thee. And if thou hadst not done thus, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> would now have established thy kingdom over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But thy kingdom shall not continue. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath sought him a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his own heart: and him hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded to be prince over his people, because thou hast not observed that which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Samuel arose and went up from Galgal to Gabaa of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>. And the rest of the people went up after <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, to meet the people who fought against them, going from Galgal to Gabaa, in the hill of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> numbered the people, that were found with him, about six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son, and the people that were present with them, were in Gabaa of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>: But the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> encamped in Machmas.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And there went out of the camp of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> three companies to plunder. One company went towards the way of Ephra to the land of Sual;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And another went by the way of Bethoron, and the third turned to the way of the border, above the valley of Seboim towards the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now there was no smith to be found in all the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had taken this precaution, lest the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> should make them swords or spears.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went down to the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, to sharpen every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his ploughshare, and his spade, and his axe, and his rake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> So that their shares, and their spades, and their forks, and their axes, were blunt, even to the goad, which was to be mended.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when the day of battle was come, there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, except <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the army of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> went out in order to advance further in Machmas.</span></p>
