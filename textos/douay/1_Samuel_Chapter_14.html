<div class="h1a">Jonathan attacks the Philistines. A miraculous victory. Saul's unadvised oath, by which Jonathan is put in danger of his life, but is delivered by the people.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now it came to pass one day that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, which is on the other side of yonder place. But he told not this to his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> abode in the uttermost part of Gabaa, under the pomegranate tree, which was in Magron: and the people with him were about six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Achias, the son of Achitob, brother of Ichabod the son of Phinees, the son of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in Silo, wore the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>. And the people knew not whither <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> was gone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now there were between the ascents, by which <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> sought to go over to the garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, rocks standing up on both sides, and steep cliffs like teeth on the one side, and on the other, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the one was Boses, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the other was Sene:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> One rock stood out toward the north, over against Machmas, and the other to the south, over against Gabaa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, let us go over to the garrison of these <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">uncircumcised</a>, it may be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will do for us: because it is easy for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to save either by many, or by few.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And his armourbearer said to him: Do all that pleaseth thy mind: go whither thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a mind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said: Behold we will go over to these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And when we shall be seen by them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If they shall speak thus to us: Stay till we come to you: let us stand still in our place, and not go up to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But if they shall say: Come up to us: let us go up, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered them into our hands, this shall be a sign unto us. <span class="stiki"><strong>This shall be a sign...</strong> It is likely <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> was instructed by <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">divine inspiration</a> to make a choice of this sign: otherwise the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">observation of omens</a> is <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> So both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> said: Behold the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> come forth out of the holes wherein they were hid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the garrison spoke to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and to his armourbearer, and said: Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said to his armourbearer: Let us go up, follow me: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered them into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> went up creeping on his hands and feet, and his armourbearer after him. And some fell before <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, others his armourbearer slew as he followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the first slaughter which <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and his armourbearer made, was of about twenty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, within half an acre of land, which a yoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And there was a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in the camp, in the fields: and all the people of their garrison, who had gone out to plunder, were amazed, and the earth trembled: and it happened as a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the watchmen of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, who were in Gabaa of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> looked, and behold a multitude overthrown, and fleeing this way and that.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to the people that were with him: Look, and see who is gone from us. And when they had sought, it was found that <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and his armourbearer were not there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to Achias: Bring the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>. (For the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> was there that day with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And while <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> spoke to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, there arose a great uproar in the camp of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and it increased by degrees, and was heard more clearly. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: Draw in thy hand.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and all the people that were with him, shouted together, and they came to the place of the fight: and behold every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> sword was turned upon his neighbour, and there was a very great slaughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> that had been with the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> yesterday and the day before, and went up with them into the camp, returned to be with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, who were with <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> that had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, hearing that the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> fled, joined themselves with their countrymen in the fight. And there were with <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> about ten thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saved <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that day. And the fight went on as far as Bethaven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were joined together that day: and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> adjured the people, saying: <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall eat food till evening, till I be revenged of my enemies. So none of the people <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">tasted any food</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And all the common people came into a forest, in which there was honey upon the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when the people came into the forest, behold the honey dropped, but no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put his hand to his mouth. For the people feared the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> had not heard when his father adjured the people: and he put forth the end of the rod, which he had in his hand, and dipt it in a honeycomb: and he carried his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And one of the people answering, said: Thy father hath bound the people with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall eat any food this day. (And the people were faint.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said: My father hath troubled the land: you have seen yourselves that my eyes are enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> How much more if the people had eaten of the prey of their enemies, which they found? had there not been made a greater slaughter among the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So they smote that day the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, from Machmas to Aialon. And the people were wearied exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And falling upon the spoils, they took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them with the blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they told <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> that the people had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, eating with the blood. And he said: You have transgressed: roll here to me now a great stone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them to bring me every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his ox and his ram and slay them upon this stone, and eat, and you shall not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, in eating with the blood. So all the people brought every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his ox with him till the night: and slew them there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> built an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and he then first began to build an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: Let us fall upon the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> by night, and destroy them till the morning light, and let us not leave a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of them. And the people said: Do all that seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in thy eyes. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: Let us draw near hither unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Shall I pursue after the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>? wilt thou deliver them into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? And he answered him not that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: Bring hither all the corners of the people: and know, and see by whom this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> hath happened to day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, who is the Saviour of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, if it was done by <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, my son, he shall surely die. In this none of the people gainsayed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And he said to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Be you on one side and I, with <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, my son, will be on the other side. And the people answered <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Do what seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in thy eyes.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, give a sign, by which we may know, what the meaning is, that thou answerest not thy servant to day: If this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> be in me, or in my son <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, give a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>: or if this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> be in thy people, give <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: Cast lots between me, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, my son.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>: Tell me what thou hast done.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do so and so to me, and add still more: for dying thou shalt die, O <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And the people said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Shall <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> then die, who hath wrought this great <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? this must not be: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he hath wrought with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> this day.
