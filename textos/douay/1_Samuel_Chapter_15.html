<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Samuel said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent me to anoint thee king over his people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: I have reckoned up all that <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a> hath done to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: how he opposed them in the way when they came up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now therefore go, and smite <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, and utterly destroy all that he hath: spare him not, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> anything that is his: but slay both man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, child and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. <span class="stiki"><strong>Child...</strong> The great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Master of life and death</a> (who cuts off one half of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> whilst they are children) has been pleased sometimes to ordain that children should be put to the sword, in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">detestation</a> of the crimes of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and that they might not live to follow the same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ways. But without such ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it is not allowable, in any <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, how <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> soever, to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> children.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> commanded the people, and numbered them as lambs: two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was come to the city of <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, he laid ambushes in the torrent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinite</a>: Go, depart, and get ye down from <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>: lest I destroy thee with him. For thou hast shown kindness to all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, when they came up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinite</a> departed from the midst of <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> smote <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a> from Hevila, until thou comest to Sur, which is over against <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he took Agag, the king of <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, alive: but all the common people he slew with the edge of the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and the people spared Agag, and the best of the flocks of sheep, and of the herds, and the garments and the rams, and all that was beautiful, and would not destroy them: but every thing that was vile, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for nothing, that they destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Samuel,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> It repenteth me that I have made <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> king: for he hath forsaken me, and hath not executed my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>. And Samuel was grieved, and he cried unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> all night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when Samuel rose early, to go to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> in the morning, it was told Samuel that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was come to <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>, and had erected for himself a triumphant arch, and returning had passed on, and gone down to Galgal. And Samuel came to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, out of the choicest of the spoils, which he had brought from <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when Samuel was come to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to him: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be thou of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, I have fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Samuel said: What meaneth then this bleating of the flocks, which soundeth in my ears, and the lowing of the herds, which I hear?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: They have brought them from <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the herds, that they might be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, but the rest we have slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Samuel said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Suffer me, and I will tell thee what the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath said to me this night. And he said to him: Speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Samuel said: When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made the head of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>? And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> anointed thee to be king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent thee on the way, and said: Go, and kill the sinners of <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, and thou shalt fight against them until thou hast utterly destroyed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: but hast turned to the prey, and hast done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to Samuel: Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and have walked in the way by which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent me, and have brought Agag, the king of <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a> I have slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But the people took of the spoils, sheep and oxen, as the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of those things that were slain, to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Galgal.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Samuel said: Doth the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> desire <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and victims, and not rather that the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> should be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>? For <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is better than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: and to hearken rather than to offer the fat or rams.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Because it is like the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of witchcraft, to rebel: and like the crime of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, to refuse to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. Forasmuch, therefore, as thou hast rejected the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath also rejected thee from being king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to Samuel: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, because I have transgressed the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandment</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and thy words, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fearing</a> the people, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> their voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But now bear, I beseech thee, my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and return with me, that I may <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And Samuel said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: I will not return with thee, because thou hath rejected the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath rejected thee from being king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Samuel turned about to go away: but he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And Samuel said to him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath rent the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">kingdom of Israel</a> from thee this day, and hath given it to thy neighbour who is better than thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But the triumpher in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> will not spare, and will not be moved to <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a>: for he is not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he should <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repent</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Then he said: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: yet honour me now before the ancients of my people, and before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and return with me, that I may <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So Samuel turned again after <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And Samuel said: Bring hither to me Agag, the king of <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>. And Agag was presented to him very fat, and trembling. And Agag said: Doth bitter death separate in this manner?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> childless, so shall thy mother be childless among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And Samuel hewed him in pieces before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in Galgal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And Samuel departed to Ramatha: but <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> went up to his house in Gabaa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And Samuel saw <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> no more till the day of his death: nevertheless, Samuel mourned for <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> repented that he had made him king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Saw Saul no more till the day of his death...</strong> That is, he went no more to see him: he visited him no more.</span></span></p>
