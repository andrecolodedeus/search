<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">Samuel is sent to Bethlehem, where he anoints David: who is taken into Saul's family.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to Samuel: How long wilt thou mourn for <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, whom I have rejected from reigning over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? fill thy horn with oil, and come, that I may send thee to Isai, the <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehemite</a>: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Samuel said: How shall I go? for <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> will hear of it, and he will <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Thou shalt take with thee a calf of the herd, and thou shalt say: I am come to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt call Isai to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and I will show thee what thou art to do, and thou shalt anoint him whom I shall show to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then Samuel did as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had said to him. And he came to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and the ancients of the city wondered, and meeting him, they said: Is thy coming hither peaceable?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said: It is peaceable: I am come to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, be ye <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>, and come with me to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. And he <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> Isai and his sons, and called them to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when they were come in, he saw Eliab, and said: Is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed before him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to Samuel: Look not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature: because I have rejected him, nor do I judge according to the look of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeth those things that appear, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> beholdeth the heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Isai called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. And he said: Neither hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> chosen this,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Isai brought Samma, and he said of him: Neither hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> chosen this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Isai therefore brought his seven sons before Samuel: and Samuel said to Isai: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath not chosen any one of these.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Samuel said to Isai: Are here all thy sons? He answered: There remaineth yet a young one, who keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Isai: Send, and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He sent therefore and brought him. Now he was ruddy and beautiful to behold, and of a comely face. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Arise, and anoint him, for this is he.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> from that day forward: and Samuel rose up, and went to Ramatha.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> departed from <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> troubled him. <span class="stiki"><strong>From the Lord...</strong> An <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a>, by divine permission, and for his punishment, either <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> or obsessed him.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the servants of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to him: Behold now an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> troubleth thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Let our lord give orders, and thy servants who are before thee, will seek out a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> skilful in playing on the harp, that when the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is upon thee, he may play with his hand, and thou mayst bear it more easily.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to his servants: Provide me then some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that can play well, and bring him to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And one of the servants answering, said: Behold I have seen a son of Isai, the <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehemite</a>, a skilful player, and one of great strength, and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fit for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and prudent in his words, and a comely person: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sent messengers to Isai, saying: Send me <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, thy son, who is in the pastures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Isai took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid of the flock, and sent them by the hand of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his son, to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and stood before him: and he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him exceedingly, and made him his armourbearer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sent to Isai, saying: Let <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> stand before me: for he hath found favour in my sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> So whensoever the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was upon <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took his harp, and played with his hand, and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was refreshed, and was better, for the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> departed from him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Departed from him...</strong> Chased away by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> devotion.</span></span></p>
