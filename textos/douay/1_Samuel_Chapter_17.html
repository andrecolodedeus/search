<div class="h1a">War with the Philistines. Goliath challenges Israel. He is slain by David.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> gathering together their troops to battle, assembled at Socho of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and camped between Socho and Azeca, in the borders of Dommim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> being gathered together, came to the valley of Terebinth, and they set the army in array to fight against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> stood on a mountain on the one side, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And there went out a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> baseborn from the camp of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Goliath, of Geth, whose height was six cubits and a span:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clothed with a coat of mail with scales, and the weight of his coat of mail was five thousand sicles of brass:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he had greaves of brass on his legs, and a buckler of brass covered his shoulders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred sicles of iron: and his armourbearer went before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And standing, he cried out to the bands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and said to them: Why are you come out prepared to fight? am not I a <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, and you the servants of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>? Choose out a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of you, and let him come down and fight hand to hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, we will be servants to you: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, you shall be servants, and shall serve us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> said: I have defied the bands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> this day: give me a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and let him fight with me hand to hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> hearing these words of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was the son of that <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Ephrathite</a>, of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem Juda</a>, before mentioned, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Isai, who had eight sons, and was an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the days of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and of great age among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And his three eldest sons followed <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> to the battle: and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of his three sons that went to the battle, were Eliab, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, and the second, Abinadab, and the third Samma:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was the youngest. So the three eldest having followed <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went, and returned from <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, to feed his father's flock at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> came out morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Isai said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his son: Take for thy brethren an ephi of frumenty, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And carry these ten little cheeses to the tribune: and go see thy brethren, if they are well: and learn with whom they are placed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and they, and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, were in the valley of Terebinth, fighting against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, therefore, arose in the morning, and gave the charge of the flock to the keeper: and went away loaded, as Isai had commanded him. And he came to the place of Magala, and to the army, which was going out to fight, and shouted for the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had put themselves in array, and the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> who stood against them were prepared.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> leaving the vessels which he had brought, under the care of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the place of the battle, and asked if all things went well with his brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And as he talked with them, that baseborn <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Goliath, the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, of Geth, showed himself coming up from the camp of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and he spoke according to the same words, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> heard them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, when they saw the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, fled from his face, fearing him exceedingly.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And some one of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said: Have you seen this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is come up, for he is come up to defy <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall slay him, the king will enrich with great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and will give him his daughter, and will make his father's house free from tribute in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> spoke to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that stood by him, saying: What shall be given to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall kill this <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, and shall take away the reproach from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? for who is this uncircumcised <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, that he should defy the armies of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the people answered him the same words, saying: These things shall be given to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall slay him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Now when Eliab his eldest brother heard this, when he was speaking with others, he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and said: Why camest thou hither? and why didst thou leave those few sheep in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>? I know thy <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and the wickedness of thy heart: that thou art come down to see the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: What have I done? is there not cause to speak?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he turned a little aside from him to another: and said the same word. And the people answered him as before.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the words which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> spoke were heard, and were rehearsed before <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when he was brought to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, he said to him. Let not any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart be dismayed in him: I thy servant will go, and will fight against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thou art not able to withstand this <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, nor to fight against him: for thou art but a boy, but he is a warrior from his youth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of the flock:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered it out of their mouth: and they rose up against me, and I caught them by the throat, and I strangled, and killed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For I thy servant have killed both a lion and a bear: and this uncircumcised <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> shall be also as one of them. I will go now, and take away the reproach of the people: for who is this uncircumcised <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, who hath dared to <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> the army of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Go, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> clothed <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> with his garments, and put a helmet of brass upon his head, and armed him with a coat of mail.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> having girded his sword upon his armour, began to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it. And he laid them off,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands: and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them into the shepherd's scrip, which he had with him, and he took a sling in his hand, and went forth against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> came on, and drew nigh against <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and his armourbearer went before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> looked, and beheld <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> him. For he was a young man, ruddy, and of a comely countenance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a staff? And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> by his gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>: Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the armies of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which thou hast defied.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> This day, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will deliver thee into my hand, and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from thee: and I will give the carcasses of the army of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> this day to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And all this assembly shall know that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saveth not with sword and spear: for it is his battle, and he will deliver you into our hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> arose, and was coming, and drew nigh to meet <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> made haste, and ran to the fight to meet the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And he put his hand into his scrip, and took a stone, and cast it with the sling, and fetching it about, struck the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> in the forehead, and he fell on his face upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> prevailed over the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, with a sling and a stone, and he struck, and slew the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>. And as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had no sword in his hand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> He ran, and stood over the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head. And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> seeing that their champion was dead, fled away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> rising up shouted, and pursued after the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> till they came to the valley and to the gates of <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>, and there fell many wounded of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> in the way of Saraim, and as far as Geth, and as far as <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> returning, after they had pursued the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, fell upon their camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> taking the head of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, brought it to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: but his armour he put in his tent.</span></p>
