<div class="h1a">The friendship of Jonathan and David. The envy of Saul, and his design upon David's life. He marries him to his daughter Michol.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> was knit with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him as his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> took him that day, and would not let him return to his father's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> made a covenant, for he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him as his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> stripped himself of the coat with which he was clothed, and gave it to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and the rest of his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went out to whatsoever business <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sent him, and he behaved himself prudently: and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> set him over the soldiers, and he was acceptable in the eyes of all the people, and especially in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> servants.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> returned, after he slew the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> came out of all the cities of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, singing and <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dancing</a>, to meet <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">king Saul</a>, with timbrels of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and cornets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> sung as they played, and they said: <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> slew his thousands, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his ten thousands.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and this word was displeasing in his eyes, and he said: They have given <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> ten thousands, and to me they have given but a thousand, what can he have more but the kingdom?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> did not look on <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> eye from that day and forward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the day after, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and he <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> in the midst of his house. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> played with his hand as at other times. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> held a spear in his hand, <span class="stiki"><strong>Prophesied...</strong> Acted the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in a mad manner.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And threw it, thinking to nail <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to the wall: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> stept aside out of his presence twice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> feared <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with him, and was departed from <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> removed him from him, and made him a <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> over a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and he went out and came in before the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> behaved wisely in all his ways, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> saw that he was exceeding prudent, and began to beware of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, for he came in and went out before them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Behold my elder daughter Merob, her will I give thee to wife: only be a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and fight the battles of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said within himself: Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> be upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Who am I, or what is my life, or my father's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that I should be son in law of the king?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And it came to pass at the time when Merob, the daughter of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, should have been given to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, that she was given to Hadriel, the Molathite, to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But Michol, the other daughter of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. And it was told <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and it pleased him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: I will give her to him, that she may be a stumbling block to him, and that the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> may be upon him. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: In two things thou shalt be my son in law this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> commanded his servants to speak to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> privately, saying: Behold, thou pleasest the king, and all his servants <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thee. Now, therefore be the king's son in law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the servants of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> spoke all these words in the ear of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: Doth it seem to you a small matter to be the king's son in law? But I am a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and of small ability.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the servants of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> told him, saying: Such words as these hath <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: Speak thus to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: The king desireth not any dowry, but only a hundred foreskins of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> thought to deliver <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when his servants had told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the words that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> had said, the word was pleasing in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to be the king's son in law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And after a few days <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> rose up, and went with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were under him, and he slew of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> two hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and brought their foreskins and numbered them out to the king, that he might be his son in law. <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> therefore gave him Michol, his daughter, to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> saw, and understood that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. And Michol, the daughter of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> began to fear <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> more: and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> became <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> enemy continually.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> went forth: and from the beginning of their going forth, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> became very famous.</span></p>
