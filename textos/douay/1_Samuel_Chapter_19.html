<div class="h1a">Other attempts of Saul upon David's life. He comes to Samuel. Saul's messengers, and Saul himself prophesy.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, my father, seeketh to kill thee: wherefore look to thyself, I beseech thee, in the morning and thou shalt abide in a secret place, and shalt be hid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art: and I will speak of thee to my father, and whatsoever I shall see, I will tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> spoke <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, his father: and said to him: <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Sin</a> not, O king, against thy servant, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, because he hath not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against thee, and his works are very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> towards thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he put his life in his hand, and slew the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> wrought great <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Thou sawest it and didst rejoice. Why therefore wilt thou <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against innocent blood, by killing <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, who is without fault?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> heard this, he was appeased with the words of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a>: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, he shall not be slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> called <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and told him all these words: and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> brought in <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and he was before him, as he had been yesterday and the day before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> began again, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went out, and fought against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and defeated them with a great slaughter, and they fled from his face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>; and he sat in his house, and held a spear in his hand: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> played with his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> endeavoured to nail <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to the wall with his spear. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slipt away out of the presence of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and the spear missed him, and was fastened in the wall, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> fled, and escaped that night.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> therefore sent his guards to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> house to watch him, that he might be killed in the morning. And when Michol, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> wife, had told him this, saying: Unless thou save thyself this night, tomorrow thou wilt die:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> She let him down through a window. And he went and fled away, and escaped.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Michol took an image, and laid it on the bed, and put a goat's skin, with the hair at the head of it, and covered it with clothes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sent officers to seize <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>; and it was answered that he was sick.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And again <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sent to see <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: Bring him to me in the bed, that he may be slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when the messengers were come in, they found an image upon the bed, and a goat skin at his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to Michol: Why hast thou deceived me so, and let my enemy go and flee away? And Michol answered <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Because he said to me: Let me go, or else I will kill thee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> fled and escaped, and came to Samuel in Ramatha, and told him all that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> had done to him: and he and Samuel went and dwelt in Najoth. <span class="stiki"><strong>Najoth...</strong> It was probably a school or college of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in or near Ramath under the direction of Samuel.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> by some, saying: Behold <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> is in Najoth, in Ramatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sent officers to take <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and when they saw a company of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a>, and Samuel presiding over them, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came also upon them, and they likewise began to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Prophesying...</strong> That is, singing praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a divine impulse. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was pleased on this occasion that both Samuel's messengers and himself should experience the like impulse, that he might understand, by this instance of the divine power, how vain are the designs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> against him whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> protects.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when this was told <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, he sent other messengers: but they also <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a>. And again <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sent messengers the third time: and they <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> also. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> being exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Went also himself to Ramatha, and came as far as the great <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cistern</a>, which is in Socho, and he asked, and said: In what place are Samuel and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>? And it was told him: Behold they are in Najoth, in Ramatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he went to Najoth, in Ramatha, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon him also, and he went on, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> till he came to Najoth, in Ramatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he stripped himself also of his garments, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> with the rest before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and night. This gave occasion to a proverb: What! is <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> too among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>?</span></p>
