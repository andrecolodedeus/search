<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> came, and said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>: Give me flesh to boil for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: for I will not take of thee sodden flesh, but raw.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the young men was exceeding great before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: because they withdrew <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> Elcana and his wife: and he said to him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> give thee seed of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, for the loan thou hast lent to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> was very old, and he heard all that his sons did to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and how they lay with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that waited at the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Do not so, my sons: for it is no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> report that I hear, that you make the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to transgress.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But the child Samuel advanced, and grew on, and pleased both the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And there came a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, and said to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Did I not plainly appear to thy father's house, when they were in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in the house of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And I chose him out of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> to be my <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to go up to my <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to me, and to wear the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> before me: and I gave to thy father's house of all the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Why have you kicked away my victims, and my gifts which I commanded to be offered in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and thou hast rather <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> thy sons than me, to eat the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of every <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Wherefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should minister in my sight, for ever.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Behold the days come: and I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And thou shalt see thy rival in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, in all the prosperity of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and there shall not be an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in thy house for ever. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thy rival...</strong> A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of another race.

But it was more fully accomplished in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> gave place to that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> However, I will not altogether take away a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of thee from my <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: but that thy eyes may faint, and thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be spent: and a great part of thy house shall die, when they come to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> estate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees: in one day they shall both of them die.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall remain in thy house shall come that he may be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, and shall offer a piece of silver, and a roll of bread, and shall say: Put me, I beseech thee, to somewhat of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priestly office</a>, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</span></p>
