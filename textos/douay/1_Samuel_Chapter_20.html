<div class="h1a">Saul being obstinately bent upon killing David, he is sent away by Jonathan.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> fled from Najoth, which is in Ramatha, and came and said to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>: What have I done? what is my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and what is my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against thy father, that he seeketh my life?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said to him: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid, thou shalt not die: for my father will do nothing, great or little, without first telling me: hath then my father hid this word only from me? no, this shall not be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> again to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in thy sight, and he will say: Let not <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> know this, lest he be grieved. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, and thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> liveth, there is but one step (as I may say) between me and death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Whatsoever thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall say to me, I will do for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>: Behold tomorrow is the new moon, and I, according to custom, am wont to sit beside the king to eat: let me go then that I may be hid in the field till the evening of the third day. <span class="stiki"><strong>To morrow is the new moon...</strong> The neomenia, or first day of the moon, kept according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, as a festival; and therefore <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> feasted on that day: and expected the attendance of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> If thy father look and inquire for me, thou shalt answer him: <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> asked me that he might run to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, his own city: because there are solemn <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> there for all of his tribe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> If he shall say: It is well: thy servant shall have peace: but if he be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, know that his malice is come to its height.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Deal mercifully then with thy servant: for thou hast brought me, thy servant, into a covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with thee. But if there be any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> in me, do thou kill me, and bring me not in to thy father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said: Far be this from thee: for if I should certainly know that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is determined by my father against thee, I could do no otherwise than tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> answered <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>: Who shall bring me word, if thy father should answer thee harshly concerning me?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Come, and let us go out into the field. And when they were both of them gone out into the field,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, if I shall discover my father's mind, tomorrow, or the day after, and there be any thing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and I send not immediately to thee, and make it known to thee,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> May the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> do so and so to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and add still more. But if my father shall continue in malice against thee, I will discover it to thy ear, and will send thee away, that thou mayst go in peace, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And if I live, thou shalt show me the kindness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: but if I die,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thou shalt not take away thy kindness from my house for ever, when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall have rooted out the enemies of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, every one of them from the earth, may he take away <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> from his house, and may the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> require it at the hands of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> enemies. <span class="stiki"><strong>May he take away Jonathan, etc...</strong> It is a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> upon himself, if he should not be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> to his promise. Ibid. <strong>Require it, etc...</strong> That is, revenge it upon <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> enemies, and upon me, if I should fail of my word given to him.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> therefore made a covenant with the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> required it at the hands of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> again to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, because he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him: for he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him as his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said to him: To morrow is the new moon, and thou wilt be missed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For thy seat will be empty till after tomorrow. So thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou must he hid, on the day when it is lawful to work, and thou shalt remain beside the stone, which is called Ezel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I will shoot three arrows near it, and will shoot as if I were exercising myself at a mark.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And I will send a boy, saying to him: Go and fetch me the arrows.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> If I shall say to the boy: Behold the arrows are on this side of thee, take them up: come thou to me, because there is peace to thee, and there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth. But if I shall speak thus to the boy: Behold the arrows are beyond thee: go in peace, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath sent thee away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And concerning the word which I and thou have spoken, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be between thee and me forever.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was hid in the field, and the new moon came, and the king sat down to eat bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when the king sat down upon his chair, (according to custom) which was beside the wall, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> arose, and <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> sat by <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> side, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> place appeared empty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said nothing that day, for he thought it might have happened to him, that he was not clean, nor purified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when the second day after the new moon was come, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> place appeared empty again. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, his son: Why cometh not the son of Isai to meat neither yesterday, nor to day?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> answered <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: He asked leave of me earnestly to go to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he said: Let me go, for there is a solemn <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in the city, one of my brethren hath sent for me: and now if I have found favour in thy eyes, I will go quickly, and see my brethren. For this cause he came not to the king's table.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, said to him: Thou son of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that is the ravisher of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, do I not know that thou <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> the son of Isai to thy own confusion, and to the confusion of thy shameless mother?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For as long as the son of Isai liveth upon earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now presently send, and fetch him to me: for he is the son of death. <span class="stiki"><strong>The son of death...</strong> That is, one that deserveth death, and shall surely be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> answering <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, his father, said: Why shall he die? What hath he done?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> caught up a spear to strike him. And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> understood that it was determined by his father to kill <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> So <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> rose from the table in great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and did not eat bread on the second day after the new moon. For he was grieved for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, because his father had put him to confusion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when the morning came, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> went into the field according to the appointment with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and a little boy with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he said to his boy: Go, and fetch me the arrows which I shoot. And when the boy ran, he shot another arrow beyond the boy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> had shot: and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> cried after the boy, and said: Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> cried again after the boy, saying: Make haste speedily, stand not. And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan's</a> boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he knew not at all what was doing: for only <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> knew the matter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> therefore gave his arms to the boy, and said to him: Go, and carry them into the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And when the boy was gone, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> rose out of his place, which was toward the south, and falling on his face to the ground, <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> thrice: and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> one another, they wept together; but <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Go in peace: and let all stand that we have sworn both of us in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose, and departed: and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> went into the city.</span></p>
