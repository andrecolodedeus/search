<div class="h1a">David receives holy bread of Achimelech, the priest: and feigns himself mad before Achis, king of Geth.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> came to Nobe, to <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a> was astonished at <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> coming. And he said to him: Why art thou alone, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with thee? <span class="stiki"><strong>Nobe...</strong> A city in the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had been translated from Silo.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: The king hath commanded me a business, and said: Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> know the thing for which thou art sent by me, and what manner of commands I have given thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now therefore if thou have any thing at hand, though it were but five loaves, give me, or whatsoever thou canst find.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> answered <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: I have no common bread at hand, but only <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> bread, if the young men be clean, especially from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>? <span class="stiki"><strong>If the young men be clean, etc...</strong> If this <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">cleanness</a> was required of them that were to eat that bread, which was a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of the bread of life which we receive in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">blessed sacrament</a>; how clean ought <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to be when they approach to our tremendous <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">mysteries</a>. And what reason hath the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of God</a> to admit none to be her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> and daily receive this <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">most pure sacrament</a>, but such as devote themselves to a life of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">perpetual purity</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> answered the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and said to him: Truly, as to what concerneth <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, we have refrained ourselves from yesterday and the day before, when we came out, and the vessels of the young men were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Now this way is defiled, but it shall also be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> this day in the vessels. <span class="stiki"><strong>The vessels...</strong> i.e., the bodies, have been <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, that is, have been kept from <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">impurity</a>. Ibid. <strong>Is defiled...</strong> Is liable to expose us to dangers of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>. Ibid. <strong>Be sanctified, etc...</strong> That is, we shall take care, notwithstanding these dangerous circumstances, to keep our vessels <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, that is, to keep our bodies from every thing that may defile us.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> therefore gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there, but only the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">loaves of proposition</a>, which had been taken away from before the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that hot loaves might be set up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the servants of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was there that day, within the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Doeg, an <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomite</a>, the chiefest of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> herdsmen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>: Hast thou here at hand a spear, or a sword? for I brought not my own sword, nor my own weapons with me, for the king's business required haste.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said: Lo, here is the sword of Goliath, the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth, wrapped up in a cloth behind the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>: if thou wilt take this, take it, for here there is no other but this. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: There is none like that, give it me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose and fled that day from the face of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and came to Achis, the king of Geth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the servants of Achis, when they saw <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, said to him: Is not this <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, the king of the land? Did they not sing to him in their <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dances</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> hath slain his thousands, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his ten thousands?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> laid up these words in his heart, and was exceedingly afraid at the face of Achis, the king of Geth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he changed his countenance before them, and slipt down between their hands: and he stumbled against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Achis said to his servants: You saw the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was mad: why have you brought him to me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Have we need of mad <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that you have brought in this fellow, to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?</span></p>
