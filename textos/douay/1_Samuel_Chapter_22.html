<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> therefore went from thence, and fled to the <a href="../cathen/01162a.htm">cave of Odollam</a>. And when his brethren, and all his father's house, had heard of it, they went down to him thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And all that were in distress, and oppressed with debt, and under affliction of mind, gathered themselves unto him: and he became their prince, and there were with him about four hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> departed from thence into <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha of Moab</a>: and he said to the king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: Let my father and my mother tarry with you, I beseech thee, till I know what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will do for me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he left them under the eyes of the king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and they abode with him all the days that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was in the hold. <span class="stiki"><strong>The hold...</strong> The strong hold, or fortress of <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad the prophet</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Abide not in the hold, depart, and go into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> departed, and came into the forest of Haret.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> heard that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was seen, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him. Now whilst <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> abode in Gabaa, and was in the wood, which is by Rama, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He said to his servants that stood about him: Hear me now, ye sons of Jemini: will the son of Isai give every one of you fields, and vineyards, and make you all tribunes, and <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> That all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me, especially when even my son hath entered into league with the son of Isai? There is not one of you that pitieth my case, nor that giveth me any information: because my son hath raised up my servant against me, plotting against me to this day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Doeg, the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomite</a>, who stood by, and was the chief among the servants of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, answering, said: I saw the son of Isai, in Nobe, with <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>, the son of Achitob, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath, the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then the king sent to call for <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the son of Achitob, and all his father's house, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that were in Nobe, and they came all of them to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>: Hear, thou son of Achitob. He answered: Here I am, my lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to him: Why have you conspired against me, thou, and the son of Isai, and thou hast given him bread and a sword, and hast consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for him, that he should rise up against me, continuing a traitor to this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a> answering the king, said: And who amongst all thy servants is so <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, who is the king's son in law, and goeth forth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thy house?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Did I begin to day to consult the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for him? far be this from me: let not the king suspect such a thing against his servant, or any one in all my father's house: for thy servant knew nothing of this matter, either little or great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the king said: Dying thou shalt die, <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>, thou and all thy father's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the king said to the messengers that stood about him: Turn, and kill the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for their hand is with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, because they knew that he was fled, and they told it not to me. And the king's servants would not put forth their hands against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the king said to Doeg: Turn thou, and fall upon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And Doeg, the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomite</a>, turned, and fell upon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and slew in that day eighty-five <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that wore the linen <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Nobe, the city of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, children and sucklings, and ox, and ass, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But one of the sons of <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>, the son of Achitob, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, escaped, and fled to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And told him that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> had slain the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>: I knew that day when Doeg, the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomite</a>, was there, that without doubt he would tell <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: I have been the occasion of the death of all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of thy father's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life, seeketh thy life also, and with me thou shalt be saved.</span></p>
