<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: Shall I go and smite these <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> abode in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> in strong holds, and he remained in a mountain of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Ziph, in a woody hill.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Go, therefore, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, and use all diligence, and curiously inquire, and consider the place where his foot is, and who hath seen him there: for he thinketh of me, that I lie craftily in wait for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Consider, and see all his lurking holes, wherein he is hid, and return to me with the certainty of the thing, that I may go with you.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they arose, and went to Ziph before <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Maon, in the plain at the right hand of Jesimon.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> went on this side of the mountain: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were on the other side of the mountain: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> despaired of being able to escape from the face of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> encompassed <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> round about, to take them.</span>
