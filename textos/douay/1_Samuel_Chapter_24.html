<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 24</h1>
<div class="h1a">Saul seeks David in the wilderness of Engaddi: he goes into a cave where David has him in his power.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds of <a href="../cathen/05428a.htm">Engaddi</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was returned from following the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, they told him, saying: Behold, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/05428a.htm">Engaddi</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, therefore, took three thousand chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> out of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and went out to seek after <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even upon the most craggy rocks, which are accessible only to wild goats.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he came to the sheepcotes which were in his way. And there was a cave, into which <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> went, to ease nature: now <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> lay hid in the inner part of the cave.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: Behold the day, of which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to thee: I will deliver thy enemy unto thee, that thou mayst do to him as it shall seem <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in thy eyes. Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose, and secretly cut off the hem of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> robe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> After which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> heart struck him, because he had cut off the hem of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> robe. <span class="stiki"><strong>Heart struck him...</strong> Viz., with remorse, as fearing he had done amiss.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be merciful unto me, that I may do no such thing to my master, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> stopped his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with his words, and suffered them not to rise against <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: but <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, rising up out of the cave, went on his way.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> also rose up after him: and going out of the cave, cried after <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, saying: My lord the king. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> looked behind him: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> bowing himself down to the ground, worshipped,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Why dost thou hear the words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that say: <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> seeketh thy hurt?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Behold this day thy eyes have seen, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered thee into my hand, in the cave, and I had a thought to kill thee, but my eye hath spared thee. For I said: I will not put out my hand against my lord, because he is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed. <span class="stiki"><strong>A thought to kill thee...</strong> That is, a suggestion, to which I did not <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Moreover, see and know, O my father, the hem of thy robe in my hand, that when I cut off the hem of thy robe, I would not put out my hand against thee. Reflect, and see, that there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in my hand, nor <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, neither have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against thee: but thou liest in wait for my life, to take it away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> judge between me and thee and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> revenge me of thee: but my hand shall not be upon thee. <span class="stiki"><strong>Revenge me of thee...</strong> Or, as it is in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, will revenge me. The meaning is, that he refers his whole cause to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to judge and punish according to his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: yet so as to keep himself in the mean time, from all personal <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, or desire of gratifying his own <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>, by seeking revenge. So far from it, that when <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was afterwards slain, we find, that instead of rejoicing at his death, he mourned most bitterly for him.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> As also it is said in the old proverb: From the wicked shall <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> come forth: therefore my hand shall not be upon thee. After whom dost thou come out, O king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and judge my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had made an end of speaking these words to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: Is this thy voice, my son <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>? And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> lifted up his voice, and wept:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thou art more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> than I: for thou hast done <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me, and I have rewarded thee with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And thou hast showed this day what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things thou hast done to me: how the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered me into thy hand, and thou hast not killed me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For who when he hath found his enemy, will let him go well away? But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> reward thee for this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> turn, for what thou hast done to me this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And now as I know that thou shalt surely be king, and have the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in thy hand:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">Swear</a> to me by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after me, nor take away my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> from the house of my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>. So <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> went home: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went up into safer places.</span></p>
