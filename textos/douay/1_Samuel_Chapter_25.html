<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 25</h1>
<div class="h1a">The death of Samuel. David, provoked by Nabal, threatens to destroy him: but is appeased by Abigail.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Samuel died, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was gathered together, and they mourned for him, and buried him in his house in Ramatha. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> rose, and went down into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Pharan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now there was a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Maon, and his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a> were in <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was very great: and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and it happened that he was shearing his sheep in <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the man was Nabal: and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his wife was Abigail. And she was a prudent and very comely <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: but her husband was churlish, and very bad and ill natured: and he was of the house of <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> heard in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, that Nabal was shearing his sheep,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He sent ten young men, and said to them: Go up to <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>, and go to Nabal, and salute him in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> with peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And you shall say: Peace be to my brethren, and to thee, and peace to thy house, and peace to all that thou hast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> I have heard that thy shepherds that were with us in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> were shearing: we never molested them, neither was there ought missing to them of the flock at any time, all the while they were with us in <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Now therefore let thy servants find favour in thy eyes: for we are come in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> day, whatsoever thy hand shall find give to thy servants, and to thy son <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> servants came, they spoke to Nabal all these words in <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and then held their peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But Nabal answering the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, said: Who is <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>? and what is the son of Isai? servants are multiplied now days who flee from their masters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh of my cattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whom I know not whence they are?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went back their way, and returning came and told him all the words that he said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to his young men: Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gird on his sword. And they girded on every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his sword. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> also girded on his sword: and there followed <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> about four hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and two hundred remained with the baggage.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But one of the servants told, Abigail, the wife of Nabal, saying: Behold, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent messengers out of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, to salute our master: and he rejected them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> These <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us, and gave us no trouble: Neither did we ever lose any thing all the time that we conversed with them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> They were a wall unto us, both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Wherefore consider, and think what thou hast to do: for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is determined against thy husband, and against thy house, and he is a son of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>, so that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can speak to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of dry figs, and laid them upon asses:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And she said to her servants: Go before me: behold, I will follow after you: but she told not her husband, Nabal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when she had gotten upon an ass, and was coming down to the foot of the mountain, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> came down over against her, and she met them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: Truly in vain have I kept all that belonged to this fellow in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and nothing was lost of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do so and so, and add more to the foes of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, if I leave of all that belong to him till the morning, any that pisseth against the wall. <span class="stiki"><strong>If I leave, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> certainly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in his designs against Nabal and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, as he himself was afterwards sensible, when he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for hindering him from executing the revenge he had proposed.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when Abigail saw <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, she made haste and lighted off the ass, and fell before <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, on her face, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> upon the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And she fell at his feet, and said: Upon me let this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> be, my lord: let thy handmaid speak, I beseech thee, in thy ears, and hear the words of thy servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Let not my lord the king, I pray thee, regard this naughty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Nabal: for according to his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, he is a fool, and folly is with him: but I, thy handmaid, did not see thy servants, my lord, whom thou sentest. <span class="stiki"><strong>His name...</strong> Nabal, in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, signifies a fool.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Now therefore, my lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, and thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> liveth, who hath withholden thee from coming to blood, and hath saved thy hand to thee: and now let thy enemies be as Nabal, and all they that seek <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to my lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Wherefore receive this <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, which thy handmaid hath brought to thee, my lord: and give it to the young men that follow thee, my lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Forgive the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of thy handmaid: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will surely make for my lord a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> house, because thou, my lord, fightest the battles of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: let not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> therefore be found in thee all the days of thy life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at any time shall rise, and persecute thee, and seek thy life, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of my lord shall be kept, as in the bundle of the living, with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of thy enemies shall be whirled, as with the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and whirling of a sling.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall have done to thee, my lord, all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have made thee prince over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> This shall not be an occasion of grief to thee, and a scruple of heart to my lord, that thou hast shed innocent blood, or hast revenged thyself: and when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall have done well by my lord, thou shalt remember thy handmaid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Abigail: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who sent thee this day to meet me, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> be thy speech:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> be thou, who hast kept me to day from coming to blood, and revenging me with my own hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Otherwise, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who hath withholden me from doing thee any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, if thou hadst not quickly come to meet me, there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light, any that pisseth against the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> received at her hand all that she had brought him, and said to her: Go in peace into thy house, behold I have heard thy voice, and honoured thy face.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold he had a feast in his house, like the feast of a king: and Nabal's heart was merry, for he was very drunk: and she told him nothing less or more until morning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But early in the morning, when Nabal had digested his wine, his wife told him these words, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And after ten days had passed, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> struck Nabal, and he died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had heard that Nabal was dead, he said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who hath judged the cause of my reproach, at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head. Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent and treated with Abigail, that he might take her to himself for a wife. <span class="stiki"><strong>Blessed be, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> praiseth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on this occasion, not out of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the death of Nabal (which would have argued a rancour of heart), but because he saw that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had so visibly taken his cause in hand, in punishing the injury done to him; whilst, by a merciful <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> he kept him from revenging himself.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> servants came to Abigail, to <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>, and spoke to her, saying: <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> hath sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And she arose, and bowed herself down with her face to the earth, and said: Behold, let thy servant be a handmaid, to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash the feet</a> of the servants of my lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And Abigail arose, and made haste, and got upon an ass, and five damsels went with her, her waiting maids, and she followed the messengers of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and became his wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Moreover <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took also Achinoam of Jezrahel: and they were both of them his wives.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> But <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> gave Michol, his daughter, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> wife, to Phalti, the son of Lais, who was of Gallim.</span></p>
