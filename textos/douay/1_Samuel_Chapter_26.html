<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Ziph came to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> in Gabaa, saying: Behold <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> is hid in the hill of Hachila, which is over against the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> arose, and went down to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Ziph having with him three thousand chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to seek <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Ziph.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> encamped in Gabaa Hachila, which was over against the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> in the way: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> abode in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He sent spies, and learned that he was most certainly come thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose secretly, and came to the place where <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was: and when he had beheld the place, wherein <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> slept, and <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, the son of Ner, the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of his army, and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sleeping in a tent, and the rest of the multitude round about him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai, the son of Sarvia, the brother of Joab</a>, saying: Who will go down with me to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> into the camp?

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a> came to the people by night, and found <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> lying and sleeping in the tent, and his spear fixed in the ground at his head: and <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> and the people sleeping round about him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath shut up thy enemy this day into thy hands: now then I will run him through with my spear, even to the earth at once, and there shall be no need of a second time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a>: Kill him not: for who shall put forth his hand against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed, and shall be guiltless?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, unless the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall strike him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down to battle, and perish:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be merciful unto me, and keep me that I never put forth my hand against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed. But now take the spear which is at his head, and the cup of water, and let us go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took the spear, and the cup of water which was at <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> head, and they went away: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> saw it, or knew it, or awaked, but they were all asleep, for a deep sleep from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was fallen upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was gone over to the other side, and stood on the top of the hill afar off, and a good space was between them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> cried to the people, and to <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, the son of Ner, saying: Wilt thou not answer, <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>? And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> answering, said: Who art thou, that criest, and disturbest the king?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>: Art not thou a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? and who is like unto thee in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to kill the king thy lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> This thing is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that thou hast done: as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, you are the sons of death, who have not kept your master, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed. And now where is the king's spear, and the cup of water, which was at his head?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> knew <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> voice, and said: Is this thy voice, my son <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>? And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: It is my voice, my lord the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said: Wherefore doth my lord persecute his servant? What have I done? or what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is there in my hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now therefore hear, I pray thee, my lord the king, the words of thy servant: If the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> stir thee up against me, let him accept of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>: but if the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they are <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who have cast me out this day, that I should not dwell in the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: Go, serve strange gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And now let not my blood be shed upon the earth before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is come out to seek a flea, as the partridge is hunted in the mountains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; return, my son <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, for I will no more do thee harm, because my life hath been precious in thy eyes this day: for it appeareth that I have done foolishly, and have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> in very many things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> answering, said: Behold the king's spear: let one of the king's servants come over and fetch it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will reward every one according to his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithfulness</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered thee this day into my hand, and I would not put forth my hand against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And as thy life hath been much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and let him deliver me from all distress.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> art thou, my son <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> doing thou shalt do, and prevailing thou shalt prevail.
