<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 27</h1>
<div class="h1a">David goes again to Achis king of Geth, and obtains of him the city of Siceleg.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said in his heart: I shall one day or other fall into the hands of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: is it not better for me to flee, and to be saved in the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> may despair of me, and cease to seek me in all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? I will flee then out of his hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose, and went away, both he and the six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, to Achis, the son of Maoch, king of Geth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> dwelt with Achis at Geth, he and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his household, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> with his two wives, Achinoam, the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was fled to Geth, and he sought no more after him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Achis: If I have found favour in thy sight, let a place be given me in one of the cities of this country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then Achis gave him Siceleg that day: for which reason Siceleg belongeth to the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the time that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> dwelt in the country of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, was four months.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went up, and pillaged Gessuri, and Gerzi, and the <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecites</a>: for these were of old the inhabitants of the countries, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> go to Sur, even to the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Pillaged Gessuri, etc...</strong> These probably were enemies of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and some, if not all of them, were of the number of those whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had ordered to be destroyed: which justifies <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> proceedings in their regard. Though it is to be observed here, that we are not under an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of justifying every thing that he did: for the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>, in relating what was done, does not say that it was well done. And even such as are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are not to be imitated in all they do.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> wasted all the land, and left neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> alive: and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achis.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Achis said to him: Whom hast thou gone against to day? <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> answered: Against the south of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and against the south of Jerameel, and against the south of Ceni.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> saved neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, neither brought he any of them to Geth, saying: Lest they should speak against us. So did <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and such was his proceeding all the days that he dwelt in the country of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Achis <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: He hath done much harm to his people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Therefore he shall be my servant for ever.</span></p>
