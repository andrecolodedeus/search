<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 28</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Philistines go out to war against Israel. Saul being forsaken by God, has recourse to a witch. Samuel appears to him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in those days, that the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> gathered together their armies, to be prepared for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: And Achis said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Know thou now assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, thou, and thy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Achis: Now thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achis said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: And I will appoint thee to guard my life for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now Samuel was dead, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> mourned for him, and buried him in Ramatha, his city. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> had put away all the magicians and soothsayers out of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were gathered together, and came and encamped in Sunam: and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> also gathered together all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and came to Gelboe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> saw the army of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and was afraid, and his heart was very much dismayed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, nor by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to his servants: Seek me a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that hath a <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divining</a> spirit, and I will go to her, and enquire by her. And his servants said to him: There is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that hath a <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divining</a> spirit at Endor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then he disguised himself: and put on other clothes, and he went, and two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him, and they came to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by night, and he said to her: Divine to me by thy <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divining</a> spirit, and bring me up him whom I shall tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to him: Behold thou knowest all that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> hath done, and how he hath rooted out the magicians and soothsayers from the land: why then dost thou lay a snare for my life, to cause me to be put to death?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> unto her by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, there shall no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> happen to thee for this thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to him: Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the king said to her: Fear not: what hast thou seen? and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he said to her: What form is he of? And she said: An old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> understood that it was Samuel, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Understood that it was Samuel...</strong> It is the more common opinion of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">holy fathers</a>, and interpreters, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Samuel appeared indeed: and not, as some have imagined, an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> in his shape. Not that the power of her <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">magic</a> could bring him thither, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was pleased for the punishment of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, that Samuel himself should denounce unto him the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that were falling upon him. See <a href="../douay/sir046.htm#verse23">Sirach 46:23</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Samuel said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Why hast thou disturbed my rest, that I should be brought up? And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said: I am in great distress: for the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> fight against me, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is departed from me, and would not hear me, neither by the hand of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayst show me what I shall do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Samuel said: Why askest thou me, seeing the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> has departed from thee, and is gone over to thy rival?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will do to thee as he spoke by me, and he will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbour <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Because thou didst not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, neither didst thou execute the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of his indignation upon <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>. Therefore hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> done to thee what thou sufferest this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also will deliver <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with thee into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and tomorrow thou and thy sons shall be with me: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will also deliver the army of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>With me...</strong> That is, in the state of the dead, and in another world, though not in the same place.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And forthwith <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> fell all along on the ground; for he was frightened with the words of Samuel, and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, (for he was very much troubled) and said to him: Behold thy handmaid hath <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand: and I hearkened unto the words which thou spokest to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, that thou mayst eat and recover strength, and be able to go on thy journey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he refused, and said: I will not eat. But his servants and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> forced him, and at length hearkening to their voice, he arose from the ground, and sat upon the bed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had a fatted calf in the house, and she made haste and killed it: and taking meal, kneaded it, and baked some <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened bread</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And set it before <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and before his servants. And when they had eaten they rose up, and walked all that night.</span></p>
