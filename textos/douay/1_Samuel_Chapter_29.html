<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 29</h1>
<div class="h1a">David going with the Philistines is sent back by their princes.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now all the troops of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were gathered together to Aphec: and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> also encamped by the fountain, which is in Jezrahel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the lords of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> marched with their hundreds and their thousands: but <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were in the rear with Achis.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> said to Achis: What mean these <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a>? And Achis said to the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: Do you not know <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> who was the servant of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and hath been with me many days, or years, and I have found no fault in him, since the day that he fled over to me until this day?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the prices of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him, and they said to him: Let this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> return, and abide in his place, which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest he be an adversary to us, when we shall begin to fight: for how can he otherwise appease his master, but with our heads?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Is not this <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, to whom they sung in their <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dances</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> slew his thousands, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his ten thousands?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then Achis called <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and said to him: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, thou art upright and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in my sight: and so is thy going out, and thy coming in with me in the army: and I have not found any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in thee, since the day that thou camest to me unto this day: but thou pleasest not the lords.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Return therefore, and go in peace, and offend not the eyes of the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Achis: But what have I done, or what hast thou found in me thy servant, from the day that I have been in thy sight until this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Achis answering, said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: I know that thou art <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in my sight, as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>: But the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> have said: He shall not go up with us to the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord, who came with thee: and when you are up before day, and it shall begin to be light, go on your way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> arose in the night, that they might set forward in the morning, and returned to the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> went up to Jezrahel.</span></p>
