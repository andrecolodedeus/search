<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 3</h1>
<div class="h1a">Samuel is four times called by the Lord: who reveals to him the evil that shall fall on Heli, and his house.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the child Samuel ministered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> before <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> was precious in those days, there was no manifest <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">vision</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Precious...</strong> That is, rare.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And it came to pass one day when <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> lay in his place, and his eyes were grown dim, that he could not see:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Before the lamp of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went out, Samuel slept in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> was.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> called Samuel. And he answered: Here am I.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he ran to <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, and said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. He said: I did not call: go back and sleep. And he went and slept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> called Samuel again. And Samuel arose and went to <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, and said: Here am I: for thou calledst me. He answered: I did not call thee, my son: return and sleep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now Samuel did not yet know the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, neither had the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> been <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> called Samuel again the third time. And he arose up and went to <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. Then <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> understood that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> called the child, and he said to Samuel: Go, and sleep: and if he shall call thee any more, thou shalt say: Speak, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went, and slept in his place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> came, and stood, and he called, as he had called the other times, Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said: Speak, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for thy servant heareth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to Samuel: Behold I do a thing in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and whosoever shall hear it, both his ears shall tingle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> In that day I will raise up against <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> all the things I have spoken concerning his house: I will begin, and I will make an end.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For I have foretold unto him, that I will judge his house for ever, for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, because he knew that his sons did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>, and did not chastise them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Therefore have I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to the house of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of his house shall not be expiated with victims nor <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> for ever.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Samuel slept till morning, and opened the doors of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>. And Samuel feared to tell the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> to <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> called Samuel, and said: Samuel, my son. And he answered: Here am I.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he asked him: What is the word that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken to thee? I beseech thee hide it not from me. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do so and so to thee, and add so and so, if thou hide from me one word of all that were said to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> So Samuel told him all the words, and did not hide them from him. And he answered: It is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: let him do what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in his sight.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Samuel grew, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with him, and not one of his words fell to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, from <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a> to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>, knew that Samuel was a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> again appeared in Silo, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> himself to Samuel in Silo, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>. And the word of Samuel came to pass to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
