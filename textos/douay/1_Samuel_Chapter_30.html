<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were come to Siceleg on the third day, the <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecites</a> had made an invasion on the south side upon Siceleg, and had smitten Siceleg, and burnt it with fire,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And had taken the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> captives that were in it, both little and great: and they had not killed any person, but had carried them with them, and went on their way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> came to the city, and found it burnt with fire, and that their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and the people that were with him, lifted up their voices, and wept till they had no more tears.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For the two wives also of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> were taken captives, Achinoam, the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was greatly afflicted: for the people had a mind to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> him, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was bitterly grieved for his sons and daughters: but <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/01102d.htm">Achimelech</a>: Bring me hither the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> brought the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: Shall I pursue after these robbers, and shall I overtake them, or not? And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Pursue after them: for thou shalt surely overtake them and recover the prey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went, he and the six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, and they came to the torrent Besor: and some, being weary, stayed there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> pursued, he and four hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: for two hundred stayed, who, being weary, could not go over the torrent Besor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they found an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> in the field, and brought him to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and they gave him bread to eat, and water to drink,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> As also a piece of a cake of figs, and two bunches of raisins. And when he had eaten them, his spirit returned, and he was refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunk water, three days and three nights.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: To whom dost thou belong; or whence dost thou come? and whither art thou going? He said: I am a young man of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the servant of an <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecite</a>: and my master left me, because I began to be sick three days ago.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For we made an invasion on the south side of Cerethi, and upon <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and upon the south of <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>, and we burnt Siceleg with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: Canst thou bring me to this company? and he said: <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">Swear</a> to me by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that thou wilt not kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee to this company. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when he had brought him, behold they were lying spread abroad upon all the ground, eating and drinking, and as it were keeping a festival day, for all the prey and the spoils which they had taken out of the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and out of the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slew them from the evening unto the evening of the next day, and there escaped not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of them, but four hundred young men, who had gotten upon camels, and fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> recovered all that the <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecites</a> had taken, and he rescued his two wives.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And there was nothing missing small or great, neither of their sons or their daughters, nor of the spoils, and whatsoever they had taken, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> recovered all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he took all the flocks and the herds, and made them go before him: and they said: This is the prey of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> came to the two hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who, being weary, had stayed, and were not able to follow <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and he had ordered them to abide at the torrent Besor: and they came out to meet <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and the people that were with him. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> coming to the people, saluted them peaceably.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then all the wicked and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that had gone with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, answering, said: Because they came not with us, we will not give them any thing of the prey which we have recovered: but let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take his wife, and his children, and be contented with them, and go his way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: You shall not do so, my brethren, with these things, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given us, who hath kept us, and hath delivered the robbers that invaded us into our hands:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall hearken to you in this matter. But equal shall be the portion of him that went down to battle, and of him that abode at the baggage, and they shall divide alike.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And this hath been done from that day forward, and since was made a statute and an ordinance, and as a law in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> came to Siceleg, and sent presents of the prey to the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, his neighbours, saying: Receive a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the prey of the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> To them that were in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and that were in Ramoth to the south, and to them that were in Jether.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And to them that were in Aroer, and that were in Sephamoth, and that were in Esthamo,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And that were in Rachal, and that were in the cities of Jerameel, and that were in the cities of Ceni,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And that were in Arama, and that were in the lake Asan, and that were in Athach,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And that were in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, and to the rest that were in those places, in which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had abode with his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
