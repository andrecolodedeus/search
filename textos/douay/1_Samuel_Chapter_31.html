<div class="h1a">Israel is defeated by the Philistines: Saul and his sons are slain.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> fought against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> fled from before the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and fell down slain in mount Gelboe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> fell upon <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and upon his sons, and they slew <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, and Abinadab, and Melchisua, the sons of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the whole weight of the battle was turned upon <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and the archers overtook him, and he was grievously wounded by the archers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and slay me, and mock at me. And his armourbearer would not: for he was struck with exceeding great fear. Then <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> took his sword, and fell upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when his armourbearer saw this, to wit, that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that same day together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that were beyond the valley, and beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> were fled, and that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was dead, and his sons, forsook their cities, and fled: and the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> came and dwelt there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And on the morrow the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> came to strip the slain, and they found <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and his three sons lying in mount Gelboe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they cut off <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> head, and stripped him of his armour, and sent into the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> round about, to publish it in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of their idols and among their people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they put his armour in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Astaroth, but his body they hung on the wall of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now when the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad had heard all that the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had done to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> All the most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> arose, and walked all the night, and took the body of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and the bodies of his sons, from the wall of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a>: and they came to Jabes Galaad, and burnt them there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they took their bones, and buried them in the wood of Jabes: and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> seven days.</span></p>
