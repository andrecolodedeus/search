<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in those days, that the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> gathered themselves together to fight: and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went out to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and camped by the Stone of help. And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> came to Aphec, <span class="stiki"><strong>The Stone of help...</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Eben-ezer</em>; so called from the help which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was pleased afterwards to give to his people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in that place, by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Samuel, <a href="../douay/1sa007.htm#verse12">1 Samuel 7:12</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And put their army in array against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And when they had joined battle, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> turned their backs to the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and there were slain in that fight, here and there in the fields, about four thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the people returned to the camp: and the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said: Why hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> defeated us to day before the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>? Let us fetch unto us the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> from Silo, and let it come in the midst of us, that it may save us from the hand of our enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So the people sent to Silo, and they brought from thence the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts</a>, sitting upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>: and the two sons of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, Ophni and Phinees, were with the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> was come into the camp, all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shouted with a great shout, and the earth rang again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> heard the noise of the shout, and they said: What is this noise of a great shout in the camp of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a>? And they understood that the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> was come into the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were afraid, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is come into the camp. And sighing, they said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Woe to us: for there was no such great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> yesterday, and the day before: Woe to us. Who shall deliver us from the hand of these high Gods? these are the Gods that struck <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with all the <a href="../cathen/12143a.htm">plagues</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and behave like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, ye <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: lest you come to be servants to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a>, as they have served you: take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and fight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> fought, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was overthrown, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> fled to his own dwelling: and there was an exceeding great slaughter; for there fell of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> thirty thousand footmen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> was taken: and the two sons of <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>, Ophni and Phinees, were slain.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And there ran a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> out of the army, and came to Silo the same day, with his clothes rent, and his head strewed with dust.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when he was come, <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> sat upon a stool over against the way, watching. For his heart was fearful for the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>. And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was come into the city, he told it: and all the city cried out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> heard the noise of the cry, and he said: What meaneth the noise of this uproar? But he made haste, and came, and told <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> was ninety and eight years old, and his eyes were dim, and he could not see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a>: I am he that came from the battle, and have fled out of the field this day. And he said to him: What is there done, my son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he that brought the news answered, and said: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is fled before the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and there has been a great slaughter of the people: moreover thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees, are dead: and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> is taken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when he had named the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>, he fell from his stool backwards by the door, and broke his neck and died. For he was an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and far advanced in years: And he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> forty years. <span class="stiki"><strong>Named the ark, etc...</strong> There is great reason, by all these circumstances, to hope that <a href="../cathen/07204b.htm">Heli</a> died in a state of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and by his temporal punishments escaped the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And his daughter in law, the wife of Phinees, was big with child, and near her time: and hearing the news that the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> was taken, and her father in law, and her husband, were dead, she bowed herself and fell in labour: for her pains came upon her on a sudden.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when she was upon the point of death, they that stood about her said to her: Fear not, for thou hast borne a son. She answered them not, nor gave heed to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And she called the child Ichabod, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is gone from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> was taken, and for her father in law, and for her husband: <span class="stiki"><strong>Ichabod...</strong> That is, Where is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? or, there is no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. We see how much the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> lamented the loss of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, which was but the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence among them. How much more ought <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to lament the loss of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself, when by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they have driven him out of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And she said: The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is departed from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> was taken.</span></p>
