<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> took the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>, and carried it from the Stone of help into <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> took the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>, and brought it into the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a>, and set it by <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotians</a> arose early the next day, behold <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a> lay upon his face on the ground before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>: and they took <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a>, and set him again in his place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the next day again, when they rose in the morning, they found <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a> lying upon his face on the earth before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>: and the head of <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a>, and both the palms of his hands, were cut off upon the threshold:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And only the stump of <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a> remained in its place. For this cause neither the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a>, nor any that go into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, tread on the threshold of <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a> in <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a> unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was heavy upon the <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotians</a>, and he destroyed them, and afflicted <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a> and the coasts thereof with emerods. And in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> and fields in the midst of that country, there came forth a multitude of mice, and there was the confusion of a great mortality in the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a> seeing this kind of plague, said: The <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the God of Israel</a> shall not stay with us: for his hand is heavy upon us, and upon <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a>, our god.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And sending, they gathered together all the lords of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> to them, and said: What shall we do with the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the God of Israel</a>? And the Gethites answered: Let the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the God of Israel</a> be carried about. And they carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the God of Israel</a> about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And while they were carrying it about, the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> came upon every city with an exceeding great slaughter: and he smote the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of every city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. And the Gethites consulted together, and made themselves seats of skins.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore they sent the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> into <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>. And when the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> was come into <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaronites</a> cried out, saying: They have brought the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the God of Israel</a> to us, to kill us and our people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> They sent therefore, and gathered together all the lords of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and they said: Send away the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the God of Israel</a>, and let it return into its own place, and not kill us and our people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For there was the fear of death in every city, and the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was exceeding heavy. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also that did not die, were afflicted with the emerods: and the cry of every city went up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span></p>
