<div class="h1a">The ark is sent back to Bethsames: where many are slain for looking through curiosity into it.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> was in the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> seven months.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> called for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, saying: What shall we do with the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>? tell us how we are to send it back to its place. And they said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> If you send back the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the God of Israel</a>, send it not away empty, but render unto him what you owe for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and then you shall be healed: and you shall know why his hand departeth not from you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> They answered: What is it we ought to render unto him for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? and they answered:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> According to the number of the provinces of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> you shall make five golden emerods, and five golden mice: for the same plague hath been upon you all, and upon your lords. And you shall make the likeness of your emerods, and the likeness of the mice, that have destroyed the land, and you shall give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: to see if he will take off his hand from you, and from your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>, and from your land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Why do you harden your hearts, as <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> hardened their hearts? did not he, after he was struck, then let them go, and they departed?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now, therefore, take and make a new cart: and two kine that have calved, on which there hath come no yoke, tie to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And you shall take the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>, and lay it on the cart, and the vessels of gold, which you have paid him for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, you shall put into a little box at the side thereof: and send it away, that it may go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And you shall look: and if it go up by the way of his own coasts, towards Bethsames, then he hath done us this great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: but if not, we shall know that it is not his hand hath touched us, but it hath happened by chance.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They did therefore in this manner: and taking two kine, that had sucking calves, they yoked them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they laid the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> upon the cart, and the little box that had in it the golden mice, and the likeness of the emerods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the kine took the straight way, that leadeth to Bethsames, and they went along the way, lowing as they went: and turned not aside neither to the right hand nor to the left: and the lords of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> followed them as far as the borders of Bethsames.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now the Bethsamites were reaping wheat in the valley: and lifting up their eyes, they saw the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, and rejoiced to see it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the cart came into the field of Josue, a Bethsamite, and stood there. And there was a great stone, and they cut in pieces the wood of the cart, and laid the kine upon it a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> took down the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>, and the little box that was at the side of it, wherein were the vessels of gold, and they put them upon the great stone. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also of Bethsames offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> victims that day to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the five princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> saw, and they returned to <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a> the same day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And these are the golden emerods, which the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> returned for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: For <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a> one, for <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> one, for <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a> one, for Geth one, for <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a> one:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the golden mice, according to the number of the cities of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, of the five provinces, from the fenced city to the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">village</a> that was without wall, and to the <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">great Abel (the stone)</a> whereon they set down the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>, which was till that day in the field of Josue the Bethsamite.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But he slew of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Bethsames, because they had seen the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>, and he slew of the people seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and fifty thousand of the common people. And the people lamented, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had smitten the people with a great slaughter. <span class="stiki"><strong>Seen...</strong> And curiously looked into. It is likely this plague reached to all the neighbouring country, as well as the city of Bethsames.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Bethsames said: Who shall be able to stand before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? and to whom shall he go up from us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Cariathiarim, saying: The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> have brought back the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>, come ye down and fetch it up to you.</span></p>
