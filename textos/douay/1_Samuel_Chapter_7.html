<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Cariathiarim came, and fetched up the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>, and carried it into the house of Abinadab, in Gabaa: and they <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a>, his son, to keep the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>In Gabaa...</strong> That is, on the hill, for Gabaa signifieth a hill.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And it came to pass, that from the day the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> abode in Cariathiarim, days were multiplied (for it was now the twentieth year) and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> rested, following the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Samuel spoke to all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, saying: If you turn to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with all your heart, put away the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a> from among you, <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a> and Astaroth: and prepare your hearts unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> put away <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a> and Astaroth, and served the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> only.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Samuel said: Gather all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, that I may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they gathered together to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, and they drew water, and poured it out before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and they <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> on that day, and they said there: We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And Samuel judged the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> heard that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> were gathered together to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, and the lords of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> went up against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And when the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> heard this, they were afraid of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they said to Samuel: Cease not to cry to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> for us, that he may save us out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it whole for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and Samuel cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard him.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> going out of <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, pursued after the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and made slaughter of them till they came under Bethchar.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Samuel took a stone, and laid it between <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a> and Sen: and he called the place The stone of help. And he said: Thus far the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath helped us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>, and they did not come any more into the borders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, all the days of Samuel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the cities which the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had taken from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, were restored to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, from <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a> to Geth, and their borders: and he delivered <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and there was peace between <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Samuel judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> all the days of his life:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he went every year about to <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> and to Galgal and to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, and he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the foresaid places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he returned to Ramatha: for there was his house, and there he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: he built also there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
