<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="h1a">Samuel growing old, and his sons not walking in his ways, the people desire a king.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons to be judges over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn son</a> was Joel: and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the second was Abia, judges in <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And his sons walked not in his ways: but they turned aside after <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">lucre</a>, and took <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, and perverted judgment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> being assembled came to Samuel to Ramatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they said to him: Behold thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: make us a king, to judge us, as all nations have.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the word was displeasing in the eyes of Samuel, that they should say: Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee. For they have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not reign over them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Rejected, etc...</strong> The government of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hitherto had been a <a href="../cathen/14568a.htm">theocracy</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself immediately ruled, by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">laws</a> which he had enacted, and by judges extraordinarily raised up by himself; and therefore he complains that his people rejected him, in desiring a change of government.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> According to all their works, they have done from the day that I brought them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> until this day: as they have forsaken me, and served <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>, so do they also unto thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now, therefore, hearken to their voice: but yet testify to them, and foretell them the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of the king, that shall reign over them. <span class="stiki"><strong>The right...</strong> That is, the manner (<em>misphat</em>) after which he shall proceed, having no one to control him, when he has the power in his hand.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then Samuel told all the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to the people that had desired a king of him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And said: This will be the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and will make them his horsemen, and his running footmen, to run before his chariots,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he will appoint of them to be his tribunes, and his <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a>, and to plough his fields, and to reap his corn, and to make him arms and chariots.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Your daughters also he will take to make him <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointments</a>, and to be his cooks, and bakers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your best oliveyards, and give them to his servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Moreover he will take the tenth of your corn, and of the revenues of your vineyards, to give to his eunuchs and servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Your servants also, and handmaids, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, he will take away, and put them to his work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Your flocks also he will <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>, and you shall be his servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And you shall cry out in that day from the face of the king, whom you have chosen to yourselves: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will not hear you in that day, because you desired unto yourselves a king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel, and they said, Nay: but there shall be a king over us,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And we also will be like all nations: and our king shall judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles for us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and rehearsed them in the ears of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to Samuel: Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> go to his city.</span></p>
