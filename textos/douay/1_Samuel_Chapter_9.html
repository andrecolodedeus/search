<h1>1 Samuel Chapter 9</h1>
<div class="h1a">Saul seeking his father's asses, comes to Samuel, by whom he is entertained.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Cis, the son of Abiel, the son of Seror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphia, the son of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Jemini</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> and strong.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he had a son whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, a choice and goodly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and there was not among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he appeared above all the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the asses of Cis, <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> father, were lost: and Cis said to his son <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Take one of the servants with thee, and arise, go, and seek the asses. And when they had passed through Mount Ephraim,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And through the land of Salisa, and had not found them, they passed also through the land of Salim, and they were not there: and through the land of Jemini, and found them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when they were come to the land of Suph, <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to the servant that was with him: Come, let us return, lest perhaps my father forget the asses, and be concerned for us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said to him: Behold there is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this city, a famous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: all that he saith, cometh certainly to pass. Now, therefore, let us go thither, perhaps he may tell us of our way, for which we are come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to his servant: Behold we will go: but what shall we carry to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? the bread is spent in our bags: and we have no present to make to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor any thing at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The servant answered <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> again, and said: Behold there is found in my hand the fourth part of a sicle of silver, let us give it to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may tell us our way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now in time past in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went to consult <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he spoke thus: Come, let us go to the seer. For he that is now called a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in time past was called a seer. <span class="stiki"><strong>Seer...</strong> Because of his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">seeing by divine light</a> hidden things and things to come.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> said to his servant: Thy word is very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, come let us go. And they went into the city, where the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when they went up the ascent to the city, they found maids coming out to draw water, and they said to them: Is the seer here?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They answered and said to them: He is: behold he is before you, make haste now: for he came to day into the city, for there is a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the people to day in the high place. <span class="stiki"><strong>A sacrifice...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> did not allow of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in any other place, but at the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, or <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a> was kept; but Samuel, by divine dispensation, offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in other places. For which dispensation this reason may be alleged, that the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">house of God</a> in Silo, having lost the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, was now cast off; as a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of the reprobation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../douay/psa077.htm#verse60">Psalm 77:60</a>, <a href="../douay/psa077.htm#verse67">77:67</a>. And in Cariathiarim where the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> was, there was neither <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>. Ibid. <strong>The high place...</strong> <em>Excelsum</em>. The <em>excelsa</em>, or high places, so often mentioned in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>, were places of <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a>, in which were <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. These were sometimes employed in the service of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in the present case: but more frequently in the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">service of idols</a>; and were called <em>excelsa</em>, which is commonly (though perhaps not so accurately) rendered high places; not because they were always upon hills, for the very worst of all, which was that of Topheth, or Geennom, (<a href="../douay/jer019.htm">Jeremiah 19</a>) was in a valley; but because of the high <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, and pillars, or monuments, erected there, on which were set up the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">images</a> of their deities.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> As soon as you come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat till he come; because he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesseth</a> the victim, and afterwards they eat that are invited. Now, therefore, go up, for to day you shall find him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they went up into the city. And when they were walking in the midst of the city, behold Samuel was coming out over against them, to go up to the high place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had revealed to the ear of Samuel the day before <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> came, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> To morrow about this same hour I will send thee a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the land of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and thou shalt anoint him to be ruler over my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and he shall save my people out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: for I have looked down upon my people, because their cry is come to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when Samuel saw <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Behold the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of whom I spoke to thee, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall reign over my people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> came to Samuel in the midst of the gate, and said: Tell me, I pray thee, where is the house of the seer?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Samuel answered <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, saying: I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, that you may eat with me to day, and I will let thee go in the morning: and tell thee all that is in thy heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And as for the asses, which were lost three days ago, be not solicitous, because they are found. And for whom shall be all the best things of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Shall they not be for thee and for all thy father's house?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> answering, said: Am not I a son of Jemini of the least <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribe of Israel</a>, and my kindred the last among all the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>? Why then hast thou spoken this word to me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then Samuel taking <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and his servant, brought them into the parlour, and gave them a place at the head of them that were invited. For there were about thirty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Samuel said to the cook: Bring the portion which I gave thee, and commanded thee to set it apart by thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the cook took up the shoulder, and set it before <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>. And Samuel said: Behold what is left, set it before thee, and eat; because it was kept of purpose for thee, when I invited the people. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> ate with Samuel that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they went down from the high place into the town, and he spoke with <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> upon the top of the house: and he prepared a bed for <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> on the top of the house and he slept.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when they were risen in the morning, and it began now to be light, Samuel called <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> on the top of the house, saying: Arise, that I may let thee go. And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> arose: and they went out both of them: to wit, he and Samuel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And as they were going down in the end of the city, Samuel said to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: Speak to the servant to go before us, and pass on: but stand thou still a while, that I may tell thee the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span></p>
