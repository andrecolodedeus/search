<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> For yourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated, (as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>) at <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippi</a>, we had confidence in our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to speak unto you the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in much carefulness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For our exhortation was not of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, nor of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, nor in <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But as we were approved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who proveth our hearts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: nor taken an occasion of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Nor sought we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither of you, nor of others.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: because you were become most dear unto us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> You are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also, how <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holily</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and without blame we have been to you that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> As you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what manner, entreating and comforting you (as a father doth his children),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hath called you unto his <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Therefore, we also give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you received it not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but (as it is indeed) the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who worketh in you that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For you, brethren, are become followers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which are in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>: for you also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Who both <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> us, and please not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are adversaries to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Prohibiting us to speak to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that they may be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, to fill up their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> always: for the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is come upon them to the end. <span class="stiki"><strong>To fill up their sins...</strong> That is, to fill up the measure of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, after which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> would punish them. <strong>For the wrath of God is come upon them to the end...</strong> That is, to continue on them to the end.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For we would have come unto you, I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> indeed, once and again: but <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> hath hindered us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For what is our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or crown of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? Are not you, in the presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> at his coming?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For you are our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span></p>
