<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> An ancient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rebuke not, but entreat him as a father: young men, as brethren:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But if any <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> have children or grandchildren, let her learn first to govern her own house and to make a return of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; for this is acceptable before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But she that is a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed, and desolate, let her trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and continue in supplications and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> night and day.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have not care of his own and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and is worse than an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> avoid. For when they have grown wanton in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they will <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>:</span>
