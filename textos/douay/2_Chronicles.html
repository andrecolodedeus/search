<h1>2 Chronicles</h1>

<h2>The Second Book of Chronicles, also called the Second Book of Paralipomenon</h2>

<p>These books are called by the Greek interpreters, <em>Paralipomenon</em>, that is, <em>of things left out</em>, or <em>omitted</em>; because they are a kind of a supplement of such things as were passed over in the <a href="../cathen/08647b.htm">books of the Kings</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a> call them <em>Dibre Haijamim</em>, that is, <em>The Words of the Days</em>, or <em>The Chronicles</em>. Not that they are the books which are so often quoted in the <a href="../cathen/08647b.htm">Kings</a>, under the title of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: for the books of Paralipomenon were written after the <a href="../cathen/08647b.htm">books of Kings</a>: but because in all probability they have been abridged from those ancient words of the days, by <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> or some other sacred writer. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/11472a.htm">PARALIPOMENON</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)
