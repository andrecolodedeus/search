<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> gave orders to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of thousands, and of <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">hundreds</a>, and to the rulers, and to the judges of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the heads of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he went with all the multitude to the high place of Gabaon, where was the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made, in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had brought the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> from Cariathiarim to the place, which he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> for it, that is, in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now therefore, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, let thy word be fulfilled, which thou hast <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my father: for thou hast made me king over thy great people, which is as innumerable as the dust of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Give me wisdom and knowledge that I may come in and go out before thy people: for who can worthily judge this thy people, which is so great?</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee: and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so that none of the kings before thee, nor after thee, shall be like thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> came from the high place of Gabaon to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>, and reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he placed them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the king made silver and gold to be in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as stones, and <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar trees</a> as sycamores, which grow in the plains in great multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And there were horses brought him from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and from Coa by the king's merchants, who went, and bought at a price,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> A chariot of four horses for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: in like manner market was made in all the kingdoms of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethites</a>, and of the kings of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</span></p>
