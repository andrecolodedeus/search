<h1>2 Chronicles Chapter 10</h1>
<div class="h1a">Roboam answers the people roughly: upon which ten tribes revolt.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Roboam went to <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>: for thither all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were assembled, to make him king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> the son of Nabat, who was in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, (for he was fled thither from <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>), heard it, forthwith he returned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they sent for him, and he came with all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Thy father oppressed with a most grievous yoke, do thou govern us with a lighter hand than thy father, who laid upon us a heavy servitude, and ease some thing of the burden, that we may serve thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to them: Come to me again after three days. And when the people were gone,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He took counsel with the ancients, who had stood before his father <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, while he yet lived, saying: What counsel give you to me, that I may answer the people?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they said to him: If thou please this people, and soothe them with kind words, they will be thy servants for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But he forsook the counsel of the ancients, and began to treat with the young men, that had been brought up with him, and were in his train.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to them: What seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to you? or what shall I answer this people, who have said to me: Ease the yoke which thy father laid upon us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But they answered as young men, and brought up with him in pleasures, and said: Thus shalt thou speak to the people, that said to thee: Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease it: thus shalt thou answer them: My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add more weight to it: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and all the people came to Roboam the third day, as he commanded them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the king answered roughly, leaving the counsel of the ancients.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he spoke according to the advice of the young men: My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, which I will make heavier: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he condescended not to the people's requests: for it was the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that his word might be fulfilled which he had spoken by the hand of Ahias the Silonite to <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> the son of Nabat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And all the people upon the king's speaking roughly, said thus unto him: We have no part in <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, nor inheritance in the son of Isai. Return to thy dwellings, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and do thou, O <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> feed thy own house. And <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went away to their dwellings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But Roboam reigned over the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> that dwelt in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tributes, and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him, and he died: and king Roboam made haste to get up into his chariot, and fled into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> revolted from the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> unto this day.</span></p>
