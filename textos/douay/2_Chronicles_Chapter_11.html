<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Speak to Roboam the son of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: You shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> return to his own house, for by my will this thing has been done.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he made to himself <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the high places, and for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, and for the calves which he had made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Moreover out of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, whosoever gave their heart to seek the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, came into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> their victims before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they strengthened the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and established Roboam the son of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> for three years: for they walked in the ways of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, only three years.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Roboam <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">took to wife</a> Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Isai.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And after her he <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> Maacha the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, who bore him Abia, and Ethai, and Ziza, and Salomith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Roboam <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> Maacha the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> above all his wives and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>: for he had <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> eighteen wives, and threescore <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>: and he begot eight and twenty sons, and threescore daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But he put at the head of them Abia the son of Maacha to be the chief ruler over all his brethren: for he meant to make him king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Because he was wiser and mightier than all his sons, and in all the countries of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and in all the walled cities: and he gave them provisions in abundance, and he sought many wives.</span></p>
