<h1>2 Chronicles Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">Roboam for his sins is delivered up into the hands of the king of Egypt: who carries away all the treasures of the temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when the kingdom of Roboam was strengthened and fortified, he forsook the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> came up against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (because they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> With twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to wit, Libyans, and Troglodites, and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he took the strongest cities in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Semeias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> came to Roboam, and to the princes of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, that were gathered together in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, fleeing from Sesac, and he said to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: You have left me, and I have left you in the hand of Sesac.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the princes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the king, being in a consternation, said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saw that they were <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Semeias, saying: Because they are <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>, I will not destroy them, and I will give them a little help, and my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> shall not fall upon <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by the hand of Sesac.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But yet they shall serve him, that they may know the difference between my service, and the service of a kingdom of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So Sesac king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> departed from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, taking away the treasures of the king's house, and he took all with him, and the golden shields that <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had made,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Instead of which the king made brazen ones, and delivered them to the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the shieldbearers, who guarded the entrance of the palace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when the king entered into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, the shieldbearers came and took them, and brought them back again to their armoury.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But yet because they were <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> turned away from them, and they were not utterly destroyed: for even in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> there were found <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> King Roboam therefore was strengthened in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and reigned: he was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the city which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> chose out of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, to establish his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> there: and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Naama an <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonitess</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and did not prepare his heart to seek the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now the acts of Roboam first and last are written in the books of Semeias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and of Addo the seer, and diligently recorded: and there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Roboam and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> all their days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And Abia his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
