<div class="h1a">Abia's reign: his victory over Jeroboam.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the eighteenth year of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">king Jeroboam</a>, Abia reigned over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Three years he reigned in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and his mother's <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Michaia, the daughter of Uriel of Gabaa: and there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Abia and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Michaia...</strong> Alias Maacha. Her father had also two <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>, viz., <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, or Abessalom, and Uriel.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when Abia had begun battle, and had with him four hundred thousand most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> and chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> put his army in array against him, eight hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who were also chosen and most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Abia stood upon mount Semeron, which was in Ephraim, and said: Hear me, O <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Do you not know that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> gave to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the kingdom over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for ever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>? <span class="stiki"><strong>A covenant of salt...</strong> That is, a firm and perpetual covenant. See <a href="../douay/num018.htm#verse19">Numbers 18:19</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> the son of Nabat, the servant of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, rose up: and rebelled against his lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And there were gathered to him vain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and children of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>: and they prevailed against Roboam the son of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: for Roboam was unexperienced, and of a fearful heart, and could not resist them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And now you say that you are able to withstand the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he possesseth by the sons of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and you have a great multitude of people, and golden calves, which <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> hath made you for gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And you have cast out the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>: and you have made you <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, like all the nations of the earth: whosoever cometh and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrateth</a> his hand with a bullock of the herd, and with seven rams, is made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of those who are no gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom we forsake not, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who minister to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> are the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> are in their order.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they offer <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, every day, morning and evening, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> made according to the ordinance of the law, and the loaves are set forth on a most clean table, and there is with us the golden candlestick, and the lamps thereof, to be lighted always in the evening: for we keep the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, whom you have forsaken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the leader in our army, and his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who sound with trumpets, and resound against you: O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, fight not against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers, for it is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> While he spoke these things, <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> caused an ambushment to come about behind him. And while he stood facing the enemies, he encompassed <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, who perceived it not, with his army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> looked back, they saw the battle coming upon them both before and behind, and they cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> began to sound with the trumpets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> shouted: and behold when they shouted, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> terrified <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that stood against Abia and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> fled before <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered them into their hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Abia and his people slew them with a great slaughter, and there fell wounded of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> five hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> were brought down, at that time, and the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> were exceedingly strengthened, because they had trusted in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Abia pursued after <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and took cities from him, <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> and her daughters, and Jesana with her daughters, Ephron also and her daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> was not able to resist any more, in the days of Abia: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> struck him, and he died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But Abia, being strengthened in his kingdom, took fourteen wives: and begot two and twenty sons, and sixteen daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the rest of the acts of Abia, and of his ways and works, are written diligently in the book of Addo the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span></p>
