<div class="h1a">The reign of Asa: his victory over the Ethiopians.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Abia slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: an Asa his son reigned in his stead: in his days the land was quiet ten years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Asa did that which was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and pleasing in the sight of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he destroyed the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> of foreign worship, and the high places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And broke the statues, and cut down the groves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he commanded <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> to seek the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers, and to do the law, and all the commandments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he took away out of all the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, and temples, and reigned in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He built also strong cities in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, for he was quiet, and there had no wars risen in his time, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> giving peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: Let us build these cities, and compass them with walls, and fortify them with towers, and gates, and bars, while all is quiet from wars, because we have sought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, and he hath given us peace round about. So they built, and there was no hinderance in building.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Asa had in his army of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that bore shields and spears of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> three hundred thousand, and of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand, all these were most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Zara the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> came out against them with his army of ten hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and with three hundred chariots: and he came as far as Maresa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Asa went out to meet him, and set his army in array for battle in the vale of Sephata, which is near Maresa:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, there is no difference with thee, whether thou help with few, or with many: help us, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>: for with confidence in thee, and in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> we are come against this multitude. O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> thou art our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prevail against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> terrified the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> before Asa and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerara: and the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> fell even to utter destruction, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> slew them, and his army fought against them, and they were destroyed. And they took abundance of spoils,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they took all the cities round about Gerara: for a great fear was come upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and they pillaged the cities, and carried off much booty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they destroyed the sheepcotes, and took an infinite number of cattle, and of camels: and returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
