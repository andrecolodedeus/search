<div class="h1a">The prophecy of Azarias. Asa's covenant with God. He deposes his mother.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a> came upon Azarias the son of Oded,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: Hear ye me, Asa, and all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is with you, because you have been with him. If you seek him, you shall find: but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And many days shall pass in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, without the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> a teacher, and without the law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when in their distress they shall return to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and shall seek him, they shall find him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> At that time there shall be no peace to him that goeth out and cometh in, but terrors on every side among all the inhabitants of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For nation shall fight against nation, and city against city, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will trouble them with all distress.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Do you therefore take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and let not your hands be weakened: for there shall be a reward for your work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when Asa had heard the words, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of Azarias the son of Oded the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, he took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and took away the idols out of all the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and out of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and out of the cities of mount Ephraim, which he had taken, and he <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which was before the porch of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he gathered together all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and the strangers with them of Ephraim, and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>: for many were come over to him out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when they were come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> They <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in that day of the spoils, and of the prey, that they had brought, seven hundred oxen, and seven thousand rams.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he went in to confirm as usual the covenant, that they should seek the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers with all their heart, and with all their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And if any one, said he, seek not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, let him die, whether little or great, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with a loud voice with joyful shouting, and with sound of trumpet, and sound of cornets,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> All that were in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> with a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>: for with all their heart they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a>, and with all their will they sought him, and they found him, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave them rest round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Moreover Maacha the mother of king Asa he deposed from the royal authority, because she had made in a grove an idol of Priapus: and he entirely destroyed it, and breaking it into pieces, burnt it at the <a href="../cathen/03475c.htm">torrent Cedron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But high places were left in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the things which his father had <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a>, and he himself had <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a>, he brought into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, gold and silver, and vessels of divers uses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And there was no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> unto the five and thirtieth year of the kingdom of Asa.</span></p>
