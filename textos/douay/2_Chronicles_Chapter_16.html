<h1>2 Chronicles Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">Asa is reproved for seeking help from the Syrians: his last acts and death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And in the six and thirtieth year of his kingdom, Baasa the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> came up against <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and built a wall about Rama, that no one might safely go out or come in of the kingdom of Asa. <span class="stiki"><strong>Six and thirtieth year of his kingdom...</strong> That is, of the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, taking the date of it from the beginning of the reign of Roboam.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and of the king's treasures, and sent to Benadad king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father, wherefore I have sent thee silver and gold, that thou mayst break thy league with Baasa king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and make him depart from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when Benadad heard this, he sent the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of his armies against the cities of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and they took Ahion, and <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">Abelmaim</a>, and all the walled cities of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when Baasa heard of it, he left off the building of Rama, and interrupted his work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then king Asa took all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and they carried away from Rama the stones, and the timber that Baasa had prepared for the building: and he built with them Gabaa, and <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> At that time Hanani the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> came to Asa king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and said to him: Because thou hast had confidence in the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and not in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, therefore hath the army of the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> escaped out of thy hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Were not the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, and the Libyans much more numerous in chariots, and horsemen, and an exceeding great multitude: yet because thou trustedst in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he delivered them into thy hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> behold all the earth, and give strength to those who with a perfect heart trust in him. Wherefore thou hast done foolishly, and for this cause from this time wars shall arise against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Asa was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the seer, and commanded him to be put in prison: for he was greatly enraged because of this thing: and he put to death many of the people at that time.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But the works of Asa the first and last are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Asa fell sick in the nine and thirtieth year of his reign, of a most <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> pain in his feet, and yet in his illness he did not seek the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but rather trusted in the skill of physicians.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he slept with his fathers: and he died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they buried him in his own sepulchre, which he had made for himself in the city of David: and they laid him on his bed full of spices and odoriferous <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointments</a>, which were made by the art of the perfumers, and they burnt them over him with very great pomp.</span></p>
