<div class="h1a">Josaphat accompanies Achab in his expedition against Ramoth; where Achab is slain, as Micheas had foretold.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now Josaphat was rich and very <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and was joined by <a href="../cathen/01177c.htm">affinity</a> to <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he went down to him after some years to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> at his coming killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people that came with him: and he persuaded him to go up to Ramoth Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to Josaphat king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: Come with me to Ramoth Galaad. And he answered him: Thou art as I am, and my people as thy people, and we will be with thee in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Josaphat said to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Inquire, I beseech thee, at present the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> gathered together of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> four hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and he said to them: Shall we go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or shall we forbear? But they said: Go up, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will deliver into the king's hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Josaphat said: Is there not here a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that we may inquire also of him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to Josaphat: There is one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of whom we may ask the will of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: but I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him, for he never <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesieth</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me, but always <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and it is <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah the son of Jemla</a>. And Josaphat said: Speak not thus, O king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> called one of the eunuchs, and said to him: Call quickly <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah the son of Jemla</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Josaphat king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, both sat on their thrones, clothed in royal robes, and they sat in the open <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> by the gate of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Sedecias the son of Chanaana made him horns of iron, and said: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: With these shalt thou push <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, till thou destroy it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> in like manner, and said: Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and thou shalt prosper, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will deliver them into the king's hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the messenger that went to call <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a>, said to him: Behold the words of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with one mouth declare <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the king: I beseech thee therefore let not thy word disagree with them, and speak thou also <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> success.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> answered him: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, whatsoever my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall say to me, that will I speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So he came to the king: and the king said to him: <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a>, shall we go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or forbear? And he answered him: Go up, for all shall succeed prosperously, and the enemies shall be delivered into your hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the king said: I adjure thee again and again to say nothing but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to me, in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then he said: I saw all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> scattered in the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: These have no masters: let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> return to his own house in peace.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to Josaphat: Did I not tell thee that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would not <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> me any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then he said: Hear ye therefore the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>: I saw the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sitting on his throne, and all the army of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> standing by him on the right hand and on the left,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Who shall deceive <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that he may go up and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And when one spoke in this manner, and another otherwise: <span class="stiki"><strong>Who shall deceive, etc...</strong> See the annotations, <a href="../douay/1ki022.htm">1 Kings 22</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> There came forth a spirit, and stood before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: I will deceive him. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: By what means wilt thou deceive him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he answered: I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Thou shalt deceive, and shalt prevail: go out, and do so.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now therefore behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath put a spirit of lying in the mouth of all thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Sedecias the son of Chanaana came, and struck <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> on the cheek and said: Which way went the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a> from me, to speak to thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> said: Thou thyself shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go in from chamber to chamber, to hide thyself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> commanded, saying: Take <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a>, and carry him to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joas the son of Amelech,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in prison, and give him bread and water in a small quantity till I return in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/10277c.htm">Micah</a> said: If thou return in peace, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath not spoken by me. And he said: Hear, all ye people.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and Josaphat king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> went up to Ramoth Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to Josaphat: I will change my dress, and so I will go to the battle, but put thou on thy own garments. And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> having changed his dress, went to the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Now the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> had commanded the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of his cavalry, saying: Fight ye not with small, or great, but with the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> only.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So when the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the cavalry saw Josaphat, they said: This is the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And they surrounded him to attack him: but he cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he helped him, and turned them away from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> For when the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the cavalry saw, that he was not the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, they left him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And it happened that one of the people shot an arrow at a venture, and struck the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> between the neck and the shoulders, and he said to his chariot <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the fight was ended that day: but the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> stood in his chariot against the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> until the evening, and died at the sunset.</span></p>
