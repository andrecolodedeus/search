<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> determined to build a house to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and a palace for himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he numbered out seventy thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He sent also to Hiram king of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, saying: As thou didst with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my father, and didst send him <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a>, to build him a house, in which he dwelt:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So do with me that I may build a house to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicate</a> it to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> before him, and to perfume with aromatical spices, and for the continual setting forth of bread, and for the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, morning and evening, and on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and on the new moons, and the solemnities of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> for ever, which are commanded for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For the house which I desire to build, is great: for our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is great above all gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Who then can be able to build him a worthy house? if <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> cannot contain him: who am I that I should be able to build him a house? but to this end only, that <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> may be burnt before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Send me therefore a skilful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, in purple, in scarlet and in blue, and that hath skill in engraving, with the artificers, which I have with me in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my father provided.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Send me also <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a>, and fir trees, and pine trees from Libanus: for I know that thy servants are skilful in cutting timber in Libanus, and my servants shall be with thy servants,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> To provide me timber in abundance. For the house which I desire to build, is to be exceeding great, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I will give thy servants the workmen that are to cut down the trees, for their food twenty thousand cores of wheat, and as many cores of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Hiram king of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> sent a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, saying: Because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> his people, therefore he hath made thee king over them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he added, saying: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, who hath given to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> a wise and knowing son, endued with understanding and prudence, to build a house to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and a palace for himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I therefore have sent thee my father Hiram, a wise and most skilful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The son of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, whose father was a Tyrian, who knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, and in marble, and in timber, in purple also, and violet, and silk and scarlet: and who knoweth to grave all sort of graving, and to devise ingeniously all that there may be need of in the work with thy artificers, and with the artificers of my lord <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> thy father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The wheat therefore, and the barley and the oil, and the wine, which thou, my lord, hast promised, send to thy servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And we will cut down as many trees out of Libanus, as thou shalt want, and will convey them in floats by sea to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>: and it will be thy part to bring them thence to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> numbered all the <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, after the numbering which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father had made, and they were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he set seventy thousand of them to carry burdens on their shoulders, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains: and three thousand and six hundred to be overseers of the work of the people.</span></p>
