<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And there came messengers, and told Josaphat, saying: There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea, and out of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and behold they are in <a href="../cathen/05428a.htm">Asasonthamar</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05428a.htm">Engaddi</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Josaphat being seized with fear betook himself wholly to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he proclaimed a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> for all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of our fathers, thou art <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and rulest over all the kingdoms and nations, in thy hand is strength and power, and no one can resist thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Didst not thou our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> kill all the inhabitants of this land before thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and gavest it to the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thy friend for ever?</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now therefore behold the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and mount Seir, through whose lands thou didst not allow <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to pass, when they came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, but they turned aside from them, and slew them not,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Do the contrary, and endeavour to cast us out of the possession which thou hast delivered to us.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Jahaziel the son of Zacharias, the son of <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a>, the son of Jehiel, the son of Mathanias, a <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a> of the sons of Asaph, was there, upon whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a> came in the midst of the multitude,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said: Attend ye, all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and you that dwell in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and thou king Josaphat: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to you: Fear ye not, and be not dismayed at this multitude: for the battle is not yours, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> To morrow you shall go down against them: for they will come up by the ascent <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Sis, and you shall find them at the head of the torrent, which is over against the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Jeruel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> It shall not be you that shall fight, but only stand with confidence, and you shall see the help of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> over you, O <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: fear ye not, nor be you dismayed: tomorrow you shall go out against them, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will be with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then Josaphat, and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and all the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> fell flat on the ground before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> of the sons of Caath, and of the sons of <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a> praised the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with a loud voice, on high.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they rose early in the morning, and went out through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Thecua: and as they were marching, Josaphat standing in the midst of them, said: Hear me, ye <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, and all the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, and you shall be secure: <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and all things shall succeed well.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he gave counsel to the people, and appointed the singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to praise him by their companies, and to go before the army, and with one voice to say: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for his mercy endureth for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when they began to sing praises, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> turned their ambushments upon themselves, that is to say, of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and of mount Seir, who were come out to fight against <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and they were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, rose up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to kill and destroy them: and when they had made an end of them, they turned also against one another, and destroyed one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> came to the watch tower, that looketh toward the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, they saw afar off all the country, for a great space, full of dead bodies, and that no one was left that could escape death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Then Josaphat came, and all the people with him to take away the spoils of the dead, and they found among the dead bodies, stuff of various kinds, and garments, and most precious vessels: and they took them for themselves, insomuch that they could not carry all, nor in three days take away the spoils, the booty was so great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And on the fourth day they were assembled in the valley of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessing</a>: for there they <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and therefore they called that place the valley of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessing</a> until this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> returned, and Josaphat at their head, into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had made them rejoice over their enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they came into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with psalteries, and harps, and trumpets into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the fear of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had fought against the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the kingdom of Josaphat was quiet, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave him peace round about.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And Josaphat reigned over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and he was five and thirty years old, when he began to reign: and he reigned five and twenty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Azuba the daughter of Selahi.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he walked in the way of his father Asa and departed not from it, doing the things that were pleasing before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But yet he took not away the high places, and the people had not yet turned their heart to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But the rest of the acts of Josaphat, first and last, are written in the words of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> the son of Hanani, which he digested into the books of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> After these things Josaphat king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> made friendship with Ochozias king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whose works were very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he was partner with him in making ships, to go to Tharsis: and they made the ships in <a href="../cathen/01792a.htm">Asiongaber</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And Eliezer the son of Dodau of Maresa <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> to Josaphat, saying: Because thou hast made a league with Ochozias, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath destroyed thy works, and the ships are broken, and they could not go to Tharsis.</span></p>
