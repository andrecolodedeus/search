<div class="h1a">Joram's wicked reign: his punishment and death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David: and Joram his son reigned in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he had brethren the sons of Josaphat, Azarias, and Jahiel, and Zacharias, and Azaria, and Michael, and Saphatias, all these were the sons of Josaphat king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and pensions, with strong cities in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: but the kingdom he gave to Joram, because he was the eldest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So Joram rose up over the kingdom of his father: and when he had established himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and some of the princes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Joram was two and thirty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eight years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he walked in the ways of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> had done: for his wife was a daughter of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, and he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> would not destroy the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: because of the covenant which he had made with him: and because he had <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to give a lamp to him, and to his sons for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> In those days <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> revolted, from being subject to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and made themselves a king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joram went over with his princes, and all his cavalry with him, and rose in the night, and defeated the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a> who had surrounded him, and all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of his cavalry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> However <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> revolted, from being under the dominion of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> unto this day: at that time Lobna also revolted, from being under his hand. For he had forsaken the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of his fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Moreover he built also high places in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and he made the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to commit fornication, and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> to transgress.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And there was a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> brought him from <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus the prophet</a>, in which it was written: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> thy father: Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Josaphat thy father nor in the ways of Asa king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But hast walked in the ways of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and hast made <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to commit fornication, imitating the fornication of the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, moreover also thou hast killed thy brethren, the house of thy father, better <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> than thyself,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will strike thee with a great plague, with all thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And thou shalt be sick of a very grievous disease of thy bowels, till thy vital parts come out by little and little every day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> stirred up against Joram the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and of the Arabians, who border on the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they came up into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and wasted it, and they carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, his sons also, and his wives: so that there was no son left him but Joachaz, who was the youngest. <span class="stiki"><strong>Joachaz...</strong> Alias Ochozias.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And besides all this the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> struck him with an incurable disease in his bowels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And as day came after day, and time rolled on, two whole years passed: then after being wasted with a long consumption, so as to void his very bowels, his disease ended with his life. And he died of a most wretched illness, and the people did not make a funeral for him according to the manner of burning, as they had done for his ancestors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> He was two and thirty years old when he began his reign, and he reigned eight years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. And he walked not rightly, and they buried him in the city of David: but not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span></p>
