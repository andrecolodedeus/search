<h1>2 Chronicles Chapter 22</h1>
<div class="h1a">The reign and death of Ochozias. The tyranny of Athalia.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> made Ochozias his youngest son king in his place: for the rovers of the Arabians, who had broke in upon the camp, had killed all that were his elder brothers. So Ochozias the son of Joram king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> reigned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Ochozias was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri. <span class="stiki"><strong>Forty-two, etc...</strong> Divers <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Greek Bibles</a> read thirty-two, agreeably to <a href="../douay/2ki008.htm#verse17">2 Kings 8:17</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He also walked in the ways of the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>: for his mother pushed him on to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> did: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he walked after their counsels. And he went with Joram the son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to fight against Hazael king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, at Ramoth Galaad: and the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> wounded Joram.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he returned to be healed in Jezrahel: for he received many wounds in the foresaid battle. And Ochozias the son of Joram king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, went down to visit Joram the son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> in Jezrahel where he lay sick.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For it was the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against Ochozias that he should come to Joram: and when he was come should go out also against <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> the son of Namsi, whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had anointed to destroy the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So when <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> was rooting out the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, he found the princes of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the sons of the brethren of Ochozias, who served him, and he slew them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he sought for Ochozias himself, and took him lying hid in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: and when he was brought to him, he killed him, and they buried him: because he was the son of Josaphat, who had sought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with all his heart. And there was no more hope that any one should reign of the race of Ochozias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For Athalia his mother, seeing that her son was dead, rose up, and killed all the royal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the house of Joram.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But Josabeth the king's daughter took Joas the son of Ochozias, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain. And she hid him with his nurse in a bedchamber: now Josabeth that hid him, was daughter of king Joram, wife of Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and sister of Ochozias, and therefore Athalia did not kill him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he was with them hid in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> six years, during which Athalia reigned over the land.</span></p>
