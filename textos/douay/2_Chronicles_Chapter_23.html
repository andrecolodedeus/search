<div class="h1a">Joiada the high priest causes Joas to be made king: Athalia to be slain, and idolatry to be destroyed.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And in the seventh year Joiada being encouraged, took the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">hundreds</a>, to wit, Azarias the son of Jeroham, and Ismahel the son of Johanan, and Azarias the son of Obed, and Maasias the son of Adaias, and Elisaphat the son of Zechri: and made a covenant with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they went about <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and gathered together the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> out of all the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And all the multitude made a covenant with the king in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>: and Joiada said to them: Behold the king's son shall reign, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath said of the sons of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And this is the thing that you shall do:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> A third part of you that come to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and of the porters shall be at the gates: and a third part at the king's house: and a third at the gate that is called the Foundation: but let all the rest of the people be in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>To the sabbath...</strong> That is, to perform in your weeks the functions of your office, or the weekly watches.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And let no one come into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and they that minister of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>: let them only come in, because they are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>: and let all the rest of the people keep the watches of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And let the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> be round about the king, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his arms; and if any other come into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, let him be slain; and let them be with the king, both coming in, and going out.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> did according to all that Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> had commanded: and they took every one his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were under him, and that came in by the course of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, with those who had fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and were to go out. For Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> permitted not the companies to depart, which were accustomed to succeed one another every week.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> the spears, and the shields, and targets of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, which he had <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he set all the people with swords in their hands from the right side of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, to the left side of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, round about the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and the testimony, and gave him the law to hold in his hand, and they made him king: and Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and his sons anointed him: and they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for him, and said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now when Athalia heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came in to the people, into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when she saw the king standing upon the step in the entrance, and the princes, and the companies about him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding with trumpets, and playing on instruments of divers kinds, and the voice of those that praised, she rent her garments, and said: Treason, treason.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> going out to the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, and the chiefs of the army, said to them: Take her forth without the precinct of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and when she is without let her be killed with the sword. For the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> commanded that she should not be killed in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they laid hold on her by the neck: and when she was come within the horse gate of the palace, they killed her there.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Joiada made a covenant between himself and all the people, and the king, that they should be the people of the lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And all the people went into the house of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and destroyed it: and they broke down his <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> and his idols: and they slew Mathan the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Joiada appointed overseers in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, under the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had distributed in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: to offer <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and singing, according to the disposition of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He appointed also porters in the gates of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, that none who was <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> in any thing should enter in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he took the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">captains of hundreds</a>, and the most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the chiefs of the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought down the king from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and brought him through the upper gate into the king's house, and set him on the royal throne.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: but Athalia was slain with the sword.</span></p>
