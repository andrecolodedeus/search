<div class="h1a">Joas reigns well all the days of Joiada: afterwards falls into idolatry and causes Zacharias to be slain. He is slain himself by his servants.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Joas was seven years old when he began to reign: and he reigned forty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Sebia of <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> all the days of Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Joiada took for him two wives, by whom he had sons and daughters.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> After this Joas had a mind to repair the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he assembled the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and said to them: Go out to the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and gather of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> money to repair the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of your God</a>, from year to year: and do this with speed: but the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> were negligent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the king called Joiada the chief, and said to him: Why hast thou not taken care to oblige the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> to bring in out of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the money that was appointed by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for all the multitude of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to bring into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Athalia, and her children have destroyed the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, and adorned the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> with all the things that had been <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the king commanded, and they made a chest: and set it by the gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> on the outside.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they made a proclamation in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should bring to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the money which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appointed for all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And all the princes, and all the people rejoiced: and going in they contributed and cast so much into the chest of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that it was filled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when it was time to bring the chest before the king by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, (for they saw there was much money), the king's scribe, and he whom the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> had appointed went in: and they poured out the money that was in the chest: and they carried back the chest to its place: and thus they did from day to day, and there was gathered an immense sum of money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the king and Joiada gave it to those who were over the works of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: but they hired with it stonecutters, and artificers of every kind of work to repair the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and such as wrought in iron and brass, to uphold what began to be falling.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the workmen were diligent, and the breach of the walls was closed up by their hands, and they set up the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> in its former state, and made it stand firm.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when they had finished all the works, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Joiada: and with it were made vessels for the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> for the ministry, and for <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and bowls, and other vessels of gold and silver: and <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> were offered in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> continually all the days of Joiada.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But Joiada grew old and was full of days, and died when he was a hundred and thirty years old.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and to his house.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And after the death of Joiada, the princes of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> went in, and worshipped the king: and he was soothed by their services and hearkened to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they forsook the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers, and served groves and idols, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> for this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he sent <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to them to bring them back to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and they would not give ear when they testified against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a> then came upon Zacharias the son of Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and he stood in the sight of the people, and said to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Why transgress you the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> which will not be for your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and have forsaken the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to make him forsake you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they gathered themselves together against him, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him at the king's commandment in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And king Joas did not remember the kindness that Joiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. And when he died, he said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> see, and require it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when a year was come about, the army of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> came up against him: and they came to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and killed all the princes of the people, and they sent all the spoils to the king of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And whereas there came a very small number of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered into their hands an infinite multitude, because they had forsaken the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers: and on Joas they executed shameful judgments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And departing they left him in great diseases: and his servants rose up against him, for revenge of the blood of the son of Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and they slew him in his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that conspired against him were Zabad the son of Semmaath an <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonitess</a>, and Jozabad the son of Semarith a <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabitess</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And concerning his sons, and the sum of money which was gathered under him, and the repairing the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, they are written more diligently in the book of kings: and Amasias his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
