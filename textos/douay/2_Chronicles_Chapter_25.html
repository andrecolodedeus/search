<h1>2 Chronicles Chapter 25</h1>
<div class="h1a">Amasias' reign: he begins well, but ends ill: he is overthrown by Joas, and slain by his people.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Amasias was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned nine and twenty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Joadan of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: but yet not with a perfect heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when he saw himself strengthened in his kingdom, he put to death the servants that had slain the king his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But he slew not their children, as it is written in the book of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded, saying: The fathers shall not be slain for the children, nor the children for their fathers, but every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall die for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Amasias therefore gathered <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> together, and appointed them by <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of thousands and of <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">hundreds</a> in all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and found three hundred thousand young men that could go out to battle, and could hold the spear and shield.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He hired also of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> a hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for a hundred talents of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came to him, and said: O king, let not the army of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> go out with thee, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is not with <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and all the children of Ephraim:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And if thou think that battles consist in the strength of the army, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will make thee to be overcome by the enemies: for it belongeth to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> both to help, and to put to flight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Amasias said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: What will then become of the hundred talents which I have given to the soldiers of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> answered him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is rich enough to be able to give thee much more than this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then Amasias separated the army, that came to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: but they being much enraged against <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, returned to their own country.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Amasias taking <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> led forth his people, and went to the vale of saltpits, and slew of the children of Seir ten thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And other ten thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">sons of Juda</a> took, and brought to the steep of a certain rock, and cast them down headlong from the top, and they all were broken to pieces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But that army which Amasias had sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, spread themselves among the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> to Beth-horon, and having killed three thousand took away much spoil.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But Amasias after he had slain the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a>, set up the gods of the children of Seir, which he had brought thence, to be his gods, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> them, and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against Amasias, sent a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to him, to say to him: Why hast thou <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> gods that have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when he spoke these things, he answered him: Art thou the king's counsellor? be quiet, lest I kill thee. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> departing, said: I know that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is minded to kill thee, because thou hast done this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and moreover hast not hearkened to my counsel.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then Amasias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> taking very bad counsel, sent to Joas the son of Joachaz the son of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: Come, let us see one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But he sent back the messengers, saying: The thistle that is in Libanus, sent to the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a> in Libanus, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and behold the beasts that were in the wood of Libanus passed by and trod down the thistle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Thou hast said: I have overthrown <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, and therefore thy heart is lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: stay at home, why dost thou provoke <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against thee, that both thou shouldst fall and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Amasias would not hearken to him, because it was the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> will that he should be delivered into the hands of enemies, because of the gods of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> So Joas king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went up, and they presented themselves to be seen by one another: and Amasias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> was in Bethsames of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> fell before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they fled to their dwellings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Joas king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> took Amasias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, the son of Joas, the son of Joachaz, in Bethsames, and brought him to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and broke down the walls thereof from the gate of Ephraim, to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he took all the gold, and silver, and all the vessels, that he found in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, and with Obededom, and in the treasures of the king's house, moreover also the sons of the hostages, he brought back to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And Amasias the son of Joas king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> lived, after the death of Joas the son of Joachaz king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, fifteen years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and last, are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And after he revolted from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, they made a conspiracy against him in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. And he fled into Lachis, and they sent, and killed him there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they brought him back upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of David.</span></p>
