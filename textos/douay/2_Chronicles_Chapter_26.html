<div class="h1a">Ozias reigns prosperously, till he invades the priests' office, upon which he is struck with a leprosy.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And all the people of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> took his son <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a>, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of Amasias his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He built Ailath, and restored it to the dominion of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, after that the king slept with his fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Jechelia of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he did that which was right in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, according to all that Amasias his father had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he sought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in the days of Zacharias that understood and saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and as long as he sought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he directed him in all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Moreover he went forth and fought against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and broke down the wall of Geth, and the wall of Jabnia, and the wall of <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>: and he built towns in <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and among the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> helped him against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and against the Arabians, that dwelt in Gurbaal, and against the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a> gave gifts to <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a>: and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was spread abroad even to the entrance of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> for his frequent victories.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> built towers in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> over the gate of the corner, and over the gate of the valley, and the rest, in the same side of the wall, and fortified them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he built towers in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and dug many <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cisterns</a>, for he had much cattle both in the plains, and in the waste of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: he had also vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains, and in <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>: for he was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> husbandry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the army of his fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that went out to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, was under the hand of Jehiel the scribe, and Maasias the doctor, and under the hand of Henanias, who was one of the king's <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the whole number of the chiefs by the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were two thousand six hundred.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the whole army under them three hundred and seven thousand five hundred: who were fit for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and fought for the king against the enemy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> prepared for them, that is, for the whole army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and slings to cast stones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he made in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> engines of diverse kinds, which he placed in the towers, and in the corners of the walls, to shoot arrows, and great stones: and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> went forth far abroad, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> helped him, and had strengthened him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But when he was made strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction, and he neglected the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and going into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, he had a mind to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ib">altar of incense</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And immediately Azarias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> going in after him, and with him fourscore <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Withstood the king and said: It doth not belong to thee, <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a>, to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that is, to the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for this ministry: go out of the sanctuary, do not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a>: for this thing shall not be accounted to thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and holding in his hand the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, threatened the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And presently there rose a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in his forehead before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> at the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ib">altar of incense</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Azarias the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and all the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> looked upon him, and saw the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in his forehead, and they made haste to thrust him out. Yea himself also being frightened, hasted to go out, because he had quickly felt the stroke of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> the king was a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> unto the day of his death, and he dwelt in a house apart being full of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, for which he had been cast out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>. And Joatham his son governed the king's house, and judged the people of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> first and last were written by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the son of Amos</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchres, because he was a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>: and Joatham his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
