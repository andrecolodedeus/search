<div class="h1a">Joatham's good reign.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Joatham was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Jerusa the daughter of Sadoc.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did that which was right before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, according to all that <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> his father had done, only that he entered not into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and the people still transgressed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He built the high gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Moreover he built cities in the mountains of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and castles and towers in the forests.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He fought against the king of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and overcame them, and the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> gave him at that time a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and as many measures of barley: so much did the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> give him in the second and third year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Joatham was strengthened, because he had his way directed before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now the rest of the acts of Joatham, and all his wars, and his works, are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joatham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
