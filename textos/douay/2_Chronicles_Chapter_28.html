<div class="h1a">The wicked and unhappy reign of Achaz.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: he did not that which was right in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father had done,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But walked in the ways of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; moreover also he cast statues for <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> It was he that burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the valley of Benennom, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his sons in the fire according to the manner of the nations, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> slew at the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> also, and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> delivered him into the hands of the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who defeated him, and took a great booty out of his kingdom, and carried it to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>: he was also delivered into the hands of the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who overthrew him with a great slaughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For Phacee the son of Romelia slew of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because they had forsaken the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> At the same time Zechri a powerful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of Ephraim, slew Maasias the king's son, and Ezricam the governor of his house, and Elcana who was next to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> carried away of their brethren two hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, boys, and girls, and an immense booty: and they brought it to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> At that time there was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> there, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Oded: and he went out to meet the army that came to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and said to them: Behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, hath delivered them into your hands, and you have butchered them cruelly, so that your cruelty hath reached up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Moreover you have a mind to keep under the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> for your bondmen and bondwomen, which ought not to be done: for you have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in this against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But hear ye my counsel, and release the captives that you have brought of your brethren, because a great indignation of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hangeth over you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then some of the chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the sons of Ephraim, Azarias the son of Johanan, Barachias the son of Mosollamoth, <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> the son of Sellum, and Amasa the son of Adali, stood up against them that came from the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they said to them: You shall not bring in the captives hither, lest we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Why will you add to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and heap up upon our former offences? for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is great, and the fierce <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hangeth over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So the soldiers left the spoils, and all that they had taken, before the princes and all the multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whom we mentioned above, rose up and took the captives, and with the spoils clothed all them that were naked: and when they had clothed and shod them, and refreshed them with meat and drink, and anointed them because of their labour, and had taken care of them, they set such of them as could not walk, and were feeble, upon beasts, and brought them to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> the city of palm trees to their brethren, and they returned to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> sent to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> asking help.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a> came and slew many of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and took a great booty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> also spread themselves among the cities of the plains, and to the south of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and they took Bethsames, and Aialon, and Gaderoth, and Socho, and Thamnan, and Gamzo, with their <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>, and they dwelt in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> because of <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, for he had stripped it of help, and had contemned the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>For he had stripped it of help...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> stripped the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> of the divine assistance by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and by his introducing <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he brought against him Thelgathphalnasar king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, who also afflicted him, and plundered him without any resistance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> stripped the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the house of the kings, and of the princes, and gave gifts to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and yet it availed him nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Moreover also in the time of his distress he increased contempt against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> himself by himself,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">Sacrificed</a> victims to the gods of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> that struck him, and he said: The gods of the kings of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> help them, and I will appease them with victims, and they will help me; whereas on the contrary they were the ruin of him, and of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Then <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> having taken away all the vessels of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, and broken them, shut up the doors of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, and made himself <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> in all the corners of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And in all the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> he built <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> to burn frankincense, and he provoked the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of his fathers to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But the rest of his acts, and all his works first and last are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: for they received him not into the sepulchres of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
