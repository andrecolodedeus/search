<div class="h1a">Hezekiah purifies the temple, and restores religion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> began to reign, when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Abia, the daughter of Zacharias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did that which was pleasing in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, according to all that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> In the first year and month of his reign he opened the doors of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and repaired them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he brought the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and assembled them in the east street.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to them: Hear me, ye <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>, purify the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers, and take away all filth out of the sanctuary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Our fathers have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, forsaking him: they have turned away their faces from the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and turned their backs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They have shut up the doors that were in the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, nor offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> in the sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath been stirred up against <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and he hath delivered them to trouble, and to destruction, and to be hissed at, as you see with your eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Behold, our fathers are fallen by the sword, our sons, and our daughters, and wives are led away captives for this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now therefore I have a mind that we make a covenant with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and he will turn away the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of his indignation from us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> My sons, be not negligent: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath chosen you to stand before him, and to minister to him, and to worship him, and to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azarias, of the sons of Caath: and of the sons of Merari, Cis the son of Abdi, and Azarias the son of Jalaleel. And of the sons of Gerson, Joah the son of Zemma, and Eden the son of Joah.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And of the sons of Elisaphan, Samri, and Jahiel. Also of the sons of Asaph, Zacharias, and Mathanias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And of the sons of Heman, Jahiel, and Semei: and of the sons of Idithun, Semeias, and Oziel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they gathered together their brethren, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> themselves, and went in according to the commandment of the king, and the precept of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to purify the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> went into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a> to sanctify it, and brought out all the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> that they found within to the entrance of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> took it away, and carried it out abroad to the <a href="../cathen/03475c.htm">torrent Cedron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the same month they came into the porch of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and they purified the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the same month they finished what they had begun.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they went in to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">king Ezechias</a>, and said to him: We have <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> all the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ia">altar of holocaust</a>, and the vessels thereof, and the table of proposition with all its vessels,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And all the furniture of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> in his reign had defiled, after his transgression; and behold they are all set forth before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">king Ezechias</a> rising early, assembled all the rulers of the city, and went up into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they offered together seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, for <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and he spoke to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, to offer them upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Therefore they killed the bullocks, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> took the blood, and poured it upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>; they killed also the rams, and their blood they poured also upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and they killed the lambs, and poured the blood upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they brought the he goats for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before the king, and the whole multitude, and they laid their hand upon them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> immolated them, and sprinkled their blood before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> for an expiation of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: for the king had commanded that the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> should be made for all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he set the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps according to the regulation of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the king, and of <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad the seer</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan the prophet</a>: for it was the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> by the hand of his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> stood, with the instruments of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with trumpets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> commanded that they should offer <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: and when the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> were offered, they began to sing praises to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and to sound with trumpets, and divers instruments which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had prepared.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And all the multitude <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, and the singers, and the trumpeters, were in their office till the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> was finished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a> was ended, the king, and all that were with him bowed down and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> and the princes commanded the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> to praise the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with the words of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and Asaph the seer: and they praised him with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bowing the knee</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> added, and said: You have filled your hands to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, come and offer victims, and praises in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>. And all the multitude offered victims, and praises, and <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> with a devout mind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the number of the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> which the multitude offered, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> six hundred oxen, and three thousand sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were few, and were not enough to flay the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> their brethren helped them, till the work was ended, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> with an easier rite than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> So there were many <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and the fat of peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, and the libations of <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>: and the service of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> was completed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, and all the people rejoiced because the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was accomplished. For the resolution of doing this thing was taken suddenly.</span></p>
