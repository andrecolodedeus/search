<div class="h1a">The plan and ornaments of the temple: the cherubims, the veil, and the pillars.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> began to build the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in mount Moria, which had been shown to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father, in the place which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had prepared in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now these are the foundations, which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> laid, to build the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, the length by the first measure sixty cubits, the breadth twenty cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the porch in the front, which was extended in length according to the measure of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits: and the height was a hundred and twenty cubits: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the greater house he ceiled with deal boards, and overlaid them with plates of fine gold throughout: and he graved in them palm trees, and like little chains interlaced with one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He paved also the floor of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> with most precious marble, of great beauty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the gold of the plates with which he overlaid the house, and the beams thereof, and the posts, and the walls, and the doors was of the finest: and he graved <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> on the walls.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He made also the house of the holy of holies: the length of it according to the breadth of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it in like manner twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with plates of gold, amounting to about six hundred talents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He made also nails of gold, and the weight of every nail was fifty sicles: the upper chambers also he overlaid with gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He made also in the house of the holy of holies two <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> of image work: and he overlaid them with gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The wings of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> were extended twenty cubits, so that one wing was five cubits long, and reached to the wall of the house: and the other was also five cubits long, and reached to the wing of the other <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> In like manner the wing of the other <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>, was five cubits long, and reached to the wall: and his other wing was five cubits long, and touched the wing of the other <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So the wings of the two <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> were spread forth, and were extended twenty cubits: and they stood upright on their feet, and their faces were turned toward the house without.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He made also a veil of violet, purple, scarlet, and silk: and wrought in it <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He made also before the doors of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> two pillars, which were five and thirty cubits high: and their chapiters were five cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He made also as it were little chains in the oracle, and he put them on the heads of the pillars: and a hundred pomegranates, which he put between the little chains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> These pillars he put at the entrance of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, one on the right hand, and the other on the left: that which was on the right hand, he called Jachin: and that on the left hand, Booz.</span></p>
