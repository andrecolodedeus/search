<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when these things had been duly celebrated, all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that were found in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, went out, and they broke the idols, and cut down the groves, demolished the high places, and destroyed the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, not only out of all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, but out of Ephraim also and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, till they had utterly destroyed them: then all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> returned to their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a> and cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> appointed companies of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, by their courses, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his own office, to wit, both of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, for <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and for peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, to minister, and to praise, and to sing in the gates of the camp of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king's part was, that of his proper substance the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> should be offered always morning and evening, and on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and the new moons and the other solemnities, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He commanded also the people that dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to give to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> their portion, that they might attend to the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Which when it was noised abroad in the ears of the people, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> offered in abundance the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of corn, wine, and oil, and honey: and brought the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of all things which the ground bringeth forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Moreover the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, that dwelt in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, brought in the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of oxen, and sheep, and the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, which they had <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and carrying them all, made many heaps.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> In the third month they began to lay the foundations of the heaps, and in the seventh month, they finished them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> and his princes came in, they saw the heaps, and they <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> asked the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, why the heaps lay so.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Azarias the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the race of Sadoc answered him, saying: Since the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> began to be offered in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, we have eaten, and have been filled, and abundance is left, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> his people: and of that which is left is this great store which thou seest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> commanded to prepare storehouses in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>. And when they had done so,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They brought in faithfully both the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and all they had <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a>. And the overseer of them was Chonenias the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, and Semei his brother was the second,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And after him Jehiel, and Azarias, and Nahath, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jesmachias, and Mahath, and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a>, overseers under the hand of Chonenias, and Semei his brother, by the commandment of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> the king, and Azarias the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, to whom all things appertained.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But Core the son of Jemna the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, the porter of the east gate, was overseer of the things which were freely offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> and the things <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> for the holy of holies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And under his charge were Eden, and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, Jesue, and Semeias, and Amarias, and Sechenias, in the cities of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to distribute faithfully portions to their brethren, both little and great:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Besides the males from three years old and upward, to all that went into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and whatsoever there was need of in the ministry, and their offices according to their courses, day by day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> To the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> from the twentieth year and upward, by their classes and companies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And to all the multitude, both to their wives, and to their children of both sexes, victuals were given faithfully out of the things that had been <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Also of the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> who were in the fields and in the suburbs of each city, there were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> appointed, to distribute portions to all the males, among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> did all things which we have said in all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and wrought that which was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and right, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> In all the service of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> according to the law and the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, desiring to seek his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with all his heart, and he did it and prospered.</span></p>
