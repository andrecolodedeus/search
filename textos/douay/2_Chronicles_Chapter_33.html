<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he turned, and built again the high places which <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> his father had destroyed: and he built <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>, and made groves, and he <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> all the host of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and worshipped them. <span class="stiki"><strong>The host of heaven...</strong> The sun, moon, and stars.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he built them for all the host of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in the two <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he made his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of Benennom: he observed dreams, followed divinations, gave himself up to magic arts, had with him magicians, and enchanters: and he wrought many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to provoke him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He set also a graven, and a molten statue in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> his son: In this house, and in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which I have chosen out of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, will I put my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> for ever.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> seduced <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beyond all the nations, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had destroyed before the face of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to his people, and they would not hearken.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And after that he was in distress he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and did <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> exceedingly before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of his fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he entreated him, and besought him earnestly: and he heard his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and brought him again to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> into his kingdom, and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> knew that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> After this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon in the valley, from the entering in of the gate round about to Ophel, and raised it up to a great height: and he appointed <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army in all the fenced cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> also which he had made in the mount of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and he cast them all out of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he repaired the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> upon it victims, and peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, and praise: and he commanded <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> to serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Nevertheless the people still <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in the high places to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his house: and his son Amon reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he did not <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself before the lord, as <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> his father had <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> himself, but committed far greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But the rest of the multitude of the people slew them that had killed Amon, and made <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> his son king in his stead.</span></p>
