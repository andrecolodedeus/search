<div class="h1a">Josiah destroys idolatry, repairs the temple, and renews the covenant between God and the people.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one and thirty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and walked in the ways of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father: he declined not, neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And in the eighth year of his reign, when he was yet a boy, he began to seek the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of his father <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and in the twelfth year after he began to reign, he cleansed <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> from the high places, and the groves, and the idols, and the graven things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they broke down before him the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>, and demolished the idols that had been set upon them: and he cut down the groves and the graven things, and broke them in pieces: and strewed the fragments upon the graves of them that had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he burnt the bones of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> of the idols, and he cleansed <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And in the cities of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and of Ephraim, and of <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>, even to <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a> he demolished all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when he had destroyed the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, and the groves, and had broken the idols in pieces, and had demolished all profane temples throughout all the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had cleansed the land, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, he sent Saphan the son of Elselias, and Maasias the governor of the city, Joha the son of Joachaz the recorder, to repair the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they came to Helcias the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>: and received of him the money which had been brought into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and which the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and porters had gathered together from <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and Ephraim, and all the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and from all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Which they delivered into the hands of them that were over the workmen in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, to repair the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and mend all that was weak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But they gave it to the artificers, and to the masons, to buy stones out of the quarries, and timber for the couplings of the building, and to rafter the houses, which the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> had destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they did all faithfully. Now the overseers of the workmen were Jahath and Abdias of the sons of Merari, Zacharias and Mosollam of the sons of Caath, who hastened the work: all <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> skilful to play on instruments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But over them that carried burdens for divers uses, were <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, and masters of the number of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and porters.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now when they carried out the money that had been brought into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, Helcias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> found the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of the law of the Lord</a>, by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to Saphan the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>: I have found the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of the law</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and he delivered it to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But he carried the book to the king, and told him, saying: Lo, all that thou hast committed to thy servants, is accomplished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> They have gathered together the silver that was found in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and it is given to the overseers of the artificers, and of the workmen, for divers works.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Moreover Helcias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> gave me this book. And he read it before the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when he had heard the words of the law, he rent his garments:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he commanded Helcias, and <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam the son of Saphan</a>, and Abdon the son of Micha, and Saphan the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and Asaa the king's servant, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Go, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for me, and for the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, concerning all the words of this book, which is found: for the great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath fallen upon us, because our fathers have not kept the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to do all things that are written in this book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Helcias and they that were sent with him by the king, went to Olda the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a>, the wife of Sellum the son of Thecuath, the son of Hasra keeper of the wardrobe: who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in the Second part: and they spoke to her the words above mentioned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And she answered them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Tell the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that sent you to me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold I will bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, and all the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curses</a> that are written in this book which they read before the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to strange gods, to provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> with all the works of their hands, therefore my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> shall fail upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But as to the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> that sent you to beseech the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thus shall you say to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Because thou hast heard the words of this book,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And thy heart was softened, and thou hast <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> thyself in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the things that are spoken against this place, and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and reverencing my face, hast rent thy garments, and wept before me: I also have heard thee, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For now I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be brought to thy tomb in peace: and thy eyes shall not see all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I will bring upon this place, and the inhabitants thereof. They therefore reported to the king all that she had said.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he called together all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And went up to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and all the people from the least to the greatest. And the king read in their hearing, in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, all the words of the book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And standing up in his tribunal, he made a covenant before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to walk after him, and keep his commandments, and testimonies, and justifications with all his heart, and with all his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to do the things that were written in that book which he had read.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he adjured all that were found in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> to do the same: and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> did according to the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> took away all the abominations out of all the countries of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> and made all that were left in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As long as he lived they departed not from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers.</span></p>
