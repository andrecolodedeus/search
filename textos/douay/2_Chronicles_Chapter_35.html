<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he set the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in their offices, and exhorted them to minister in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he spoke to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, by whose instruction all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: Put the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> in the sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> built: for you shall carry it no more: but minister now to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, and to his people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And prepare yourselves by your houses, and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> according to your courses, as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> commanded, and <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> his son hath written.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And serve ye in the sanctuary by the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and companies of <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And being <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> kill the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">phase</a>, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the words which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> gave to all the people that were found there in the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">solemnity of the phase</a>, of lambs and of kids of the flocks, and of other small cattle thirty thousand, and of oxen three thousand, all these were of the king's substance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And his princes willingly offered what they had <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a>, both to the people and to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>. Moreover Helcias, and Zacharias, and Jahiel rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, gave to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a> two thousand six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Chonenias, and Semeias and Nathanael, his brethren, and Hasabias, and Jehiel, and Jozabad princes of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, gave to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a> five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the ministry was prepared, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stood in their office: the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> also in their companies, according to the king's commandment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">phase</a> was immolated: and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sprinkled the blood with their hand, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> flayed the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they separated them, to give them by the houses and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of every one, and to be offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of Moses</a>, and with the oxen they did in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they roasted the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">phase</a> with fire, according to that which is written in the law: but the victims of peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> they boiled in caldrons, and kettles, and pots, and they distributed them speedily among all the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were busied in <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> of <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and the fat until night, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> prepared for themselves, and for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> last.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the singers the sons of Asaph stood in their order, according to the commandment of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and Asaph, and Heman, and Idithun, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the king: and the porters kept guard at every gate, so as not to depart one moment from their service, and therefore their brethren the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> prepared meats for them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So all the service of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was duly accomplished that day, both in keeping the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a> and <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, according to the commandment of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">king Josias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> that were found there, kept the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a> at that time, and the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of unleavened</a> seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> There was no <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a> like to this in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, from the days of Samuel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: neither did any of all the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> keep such a <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a> as <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> kept, with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that were found, and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> In the eighteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> was this <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a> celebrated.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> After that <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> had repaired the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, Nechao king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> came up to fight in Charcamis by the Euphrates: and <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> went out to meet him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But he sent messengers to him, saying: What have I to do with thee, O king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>? I come not against thee this day, but I fight against another house, to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath commanded me to go in haste: forbear to do against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is with me, lest he kill thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> would not return, but prepared to fight against him, and hearkened not to the words of Nechao from the mouth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but went to fight in the field of <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And there he was wounded by the archers, and he said to his servants: Carry me out of the battle, for I am grievously wounded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they removed him from the chariot into another, that followed him after the manner of kings, and they carried him away to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and he died, and was buried in the monument of his fathers, and all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> mourned for him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Particularly <a href="../cathen/08333c.htm">Jeremiah</a>: whose lamentations for <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> all the singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and singing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> repeat unto this day, and it became like a law in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold it is found written in the Lamentations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> and of his mercies, according to what was commanded by the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And his works first and last, are written in the book of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
