<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then the people of the land took Joachaz the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>, and made him king instead of his father in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and deposed him, and condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he made Eliakim his brother king in his stead, over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and he turned his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> to Joakim: but he took Joachaz with him and carried him away into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Against him came up <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> king of the Chaldeans, and led him bound in chains into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he carried also thither the vessels of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and put them in his <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the rest of the acts of Joakim, and his abominations, which he wrought, and the things that were found in him, are contained in the book of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And Joachin his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Joachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Eight years old...</strong> He was associated by his father to the kingdom, when he was but eight years old; but after his father's death, when he reigned alone, he was eighteen years old. <a href="../douay/2ki024.htm#verse8">2 Kings 24:8</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And at the return of the year, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a> sent, and brought him to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, carrying away at the same time the most precious vessels of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and he made Sedecias his uncle king over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and did not reverence the face of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> speaking to him from the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He also revolted from <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>, who had made him <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and he hardened his neck and his heart, from returning to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Moreover all the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the people <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a> transgressed according to all the abominations of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and they defiled the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, which he had <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> to himself in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers sent to them, by the hand of his messengers, rising early, and daily admonishing them: because he spared his people and his dwelling place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But they mocked the messengers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> his words, and misused the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, until the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> arose against his people, and there was no remedy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, and he slew their young men with the sword in the house of his sanctuary, he had no compassion on young man, or maiden, old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or even him that stooped for age, but he delivered them all into his hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And all the vessels of the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, great and small, and the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and of the king, and of the princes he carried away to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the enemies set fire to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, and broke down the wall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, burnt all the towers, and what soever was precious they destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Whosoever escaped the sword, was led into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and there served the king and his sons, till the reign of the king of Persia,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> That the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a> might be fulfilled, and the land might keep her <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>: for all the days of the desolation she kept a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, till the seventy years were expired.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But in the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which he had spoken by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> stirred up the heart of Cyrus, king of the Persians: who commanded it to be proclaimed through all his kingdom, and by writing also, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> given to me, and he hath charged me to build him a house in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>: who is there among you of all his people? The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be with him, and let him go up.</span></p>
