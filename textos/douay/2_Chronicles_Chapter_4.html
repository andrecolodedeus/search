<h1>2 Chronicles Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">The altar of brass, the molten sea upon twelve oxen, the ten loaves, the candlesticks and other vessels and ornaments of the temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> He made also an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of brass twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits broad, and ten cubits high.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Also a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass: it was five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And under it there was the likeness of oxen, and certain engravings on the outside of ten cubits compassed the belly of the sea, as it were with two rows.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the oxen were cast: and the sea itself was set upon the twelve oxen, three of which looked toward the north, and other three toward the west: and other three toward the south, and the other three that remained toward the east, and the sea stood upon them: and the hinder parts of the oxen were inward under the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now the thickness of it was a handbreadth, and the brim of it was like the brim of a cup, or of a crisped lily: and it held three thousand measures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He made also ten lavers: and he set five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them all such things as they were to offer for <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>: but the sea was for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash</a> in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he made ten golden candlesticks, according to the form which they were commanded to be made by: and he set them in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Moreover also ten tables: and he set them in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, five on the right side, and five on the left. Also a hundred bowls of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He made also the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and a great hall, and doors in the hall, which he covered with brass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he set the sea on the right side over against the east toward the south.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Hiram made caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls: and finished all the king's work the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> That is to say, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters, and the network, to cover the chapiters over the pommels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And four hundred pomegranates, and two wreaths of network, so that two rows of pomegranates were joined to each wreath, to cover the pommels, and the chapiters of the pillars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He made also bases, and lavers, which he set upon the bases:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> One sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls. All the vessels did Hiram his father make for <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> of the finest brass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> In the country near the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> did the king cast them, in a clay ground between Sochot and Saredatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the multitude of vessels was innumerable, so that the weight of the brass was not known.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> made all the vessels for the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, and the golden <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and the tables, upon which were the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">loaves of proposition</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The candlesticks also of most pure gold with their lamps to give light before the oracle, according to the manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And certain flowers, and lamps, and golden tongs: all were made of the finest gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The vessels also for the perfumes, and the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, and the bowls, and the mortars, of pure gold. And he graved the doors of the inner <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, that is, for the holy of holies: and the doors of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> without were of gold. And thus all the work was finished which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> made in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span></p>
