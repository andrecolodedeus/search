<h1>2 Chronicles Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">The ark is brought with great solemnity into the temple: the temple is filled with the glory of God.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> brought in all those things that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father had <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a>, the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he put among the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And after this he gathered together the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and all the princes of the tribes, and the heads of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to bring the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> out of the city of David, which is Sion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> came to the king in the solemn day of the seventh month.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were come, the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> took up the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And brought it in, together with all the furniture of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> carried the vessels of the sanctuary, which were in the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> and all the assembly of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and all that were gathered together before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> rams, and oxen without number: so great was the multitude of the victims.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> brought in the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> into its place, that is, to the oracle of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, into the holy of holies under the wings of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So that the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> spread their wings over the place, in which the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> was set, and covered the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> itself and its staves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now the ends of the staves wherewith the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> was carried, because they were some thing longer, were seen before the oracle: but if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were a little outward, he could not see them. So the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> has been there unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And there was nothing else in the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> but the two tables which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> put there at <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a> when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave the law to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, at their coming out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were come out of the sanctuary, for all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that could be found there, were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>: and as yet at that time the courses and orders of the ministries were not divided among them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Both the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and the singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that is, both they that were under Asaph, and they that were under Heman, and they that were under Idithun, with their sons, and their brethren, clothed with fine linen, sounded with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, standing on the east side of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and with them a hundred and twenty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, sounding with trumpets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So when they all sounded together, both with trumpets, and voice, and cymbals, and organs, and with divers kind of musical instruments, and lifted up their voice on high: the sound was heard afar off, so that when they began to praise the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and to say: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for his mercy endureth for ever: the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> was filled with a cloud.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Nor could the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stand and minister by reason of the cloud. For the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had filled the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>.</span></p>
