<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But I have built a house to his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, that he might dwell there for ever.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> From the day that I brought my people out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, I chose no city among all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, for a house to be built in it to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: neither chose I any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to be the ruler of my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But I chose <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, that my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> might be there: and I chose <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to set him over my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And whereas <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my father had a mind to build a house to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Forasmuch as it was thy will to build a house to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, thou hast done well indeed in having such a will:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But thou shalt not build the house, but thy son, who shall come out of thy loins, he shall build a house to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> therefore hath accomplished his word which he spoke: and I am risen up in the place of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my father, and sit upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>: and have built a house to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I have put in it the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, wherein is the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he made with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he stood before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, in presence of all the multitude of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and stretched forth his hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had made a brazen scaffold, and had set it in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, which was five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high: and he stood upon it: then kneeling down in the presence of all the multitude of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and lifting up his hands towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> like thee in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> nor in earth: who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Who hast performed to thy servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my father all that thou hast <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> him: and hast accomplished in fact, what thou hast spoken with thy mouth, as also the present time proveth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now then, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, fulfil to thy servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> my father, whatsoever thou hast <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> him, saying: There shall not fail thee a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in my sight, to sit upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: yet so that thy children take heed to their ways, and walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And now, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, let thy word be established which thou hast spoken to thy servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Is it credible then that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should dwell with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> on the earth?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But to this end only it is made, that thou mayest regard the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of thy servant and his supplication, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and mayest hear the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which thy servant poureth out before thee.</span>
