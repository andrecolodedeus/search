<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had made an end of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, fire came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and consumed the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and the victims: and the majesty of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> filled the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Neither could the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> enter into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, because the majesty of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had filled the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Moreover all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> saw the fire coming down, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> upon the house: and falling down with their faces to the ground, upon the stone pavement, they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> and praised the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: because he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because his mercy endureth for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king and all the people <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> victims before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> offered a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred and twenty thousand rams: and the king and all the people <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stood in their offices: and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> with the instruments of music of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> made to praise the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: because his mercy endureth for ever, singing the hymns of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> by their ministry: and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sounded with trumpets before them, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> stood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> also <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> the middle of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>: for he offered there the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and the fat of the peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>: because the brazen <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, which he had made, could not hold the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and the fat:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> kept the solemnity at that time seven days, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Emath to the torrent of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he made on the eighth day a solemn assembly, because he had kept the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> seven days, and had celebrated the solemnity seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent away the people to their dwellings, joyful and glad for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had done to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> finished the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the king's house, and all that he had designed in his heart to do, in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and in his own house, and he prospered.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared to him by night, and said: I have heard thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and I have chosen this place to myself for a house of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> If I shut up <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and there fall no rain, or if I give orders, and command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And my people, upon whom my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is called, being converted, shall make supplication to me, and seek out my face, and do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for their most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ways: then will I hear from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and will forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and will heal their land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> My eyes also shall be open, and my ears attentive to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of him that shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in this place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For I have chosen, and have <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> this place, that my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> may be there for ever, and my eyes and my heart may remain there perpetually.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And as for thee, if thou walk before me, as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and keep my justices and my judgments:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> I will raise up the throne of thy kingdom, as I <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of thy stock to be ruler in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But if you turn away, and forsake my justices, and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve strange gods, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> I will pluck you up by the root out of my land which I have given you: and this house which I have <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, I will cast away from before my face, and will make it a byword, and an example among all nations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And this house shall be for a proverb to all that pass by, and they shall be astonished and say: Why hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> done thus to this land, and to this house?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they shall answer: Because they forsook the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and laid hold on strange gods, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> them, and worshipped them: therefore all these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are come upon them.</span></p>
