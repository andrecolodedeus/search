<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And at the end of twenty years after <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had built the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> and his own house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He built the cities which Hiram had given to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and caused the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> to dwell there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He went also into Emath Suba, and possessed it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he built Palmira in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and he built other strong cities in Emath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, walled cities with gates and bars and locks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Balaath also and all the strong cities that were <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a>, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen. All that <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had a mind, and designed, he built in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and in Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> All the people that were left of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, and the Pherezites, and the Hevites, and the Jebusites, that were not of the stock of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Of their children, and of the posterity, whom the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> had not slain, <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> made to be the tributaries, unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> he set none to serve in the king's works: for they were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and chief <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, and rulers of his chariots and horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And all the chief <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon's</a> army were two hundred and fifty, who taught the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he removed the daughter of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> from the city of David, to the house which he had built for her. For the king said: My wife shall not dwell in the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for it is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> came into it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> which he had built before the porch,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> That every day an <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> might be made on it according to the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and on the new moons, and on the festival days three times a year, that is to say, in the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of unleavened bread</a>, and in the feast of weeks, and in the <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">feast of tabernacles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he appointed according to the order of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father the offices of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in their ministries: and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> in their order to give praise, and minister before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> according to the duty of every day: and the porters in their divisions by gate and gate: for so <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> departed not from the king's commandments, as to any thing that he had commanded, and as to the keeping of the treasures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had all charges prepared, from the day that he founded the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, until the day wherein he finished it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> went to <a href="../cathen/01792a.htm">Asiongaber</a>, and to Ailath, on the coast of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, which is in the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">land of Edom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Hiram sent him ships by the hands of his servants, and skilful mariners, and they went with <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a> servants to <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a>, and they took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought it to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>.</span></p>
