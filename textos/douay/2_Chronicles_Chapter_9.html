<div class="h1a">The queen of Saba admires the wisdom of Solomon. His riches and glory. His death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when the queen of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a> heard of the fame of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, she came to try him with hard questions at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, with great riches, and camels, which carried spices, and abundance of gold, and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>. And when she was come to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, she proposed to him all that was in her heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> explained to her all that she proposed: and there was not any thing that he did not make clear unto her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when she had seen these things, to wit, the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and the house which he had built,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the meats of his table, and the dwelling places of his servants, and the attendance of his officers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their garments, and the victims which he offered in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: there was no more spirit in her, she was so astonished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And she said to the king: The word is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which I heard in my country of thy <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and wisdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them that told it, until I came, and my eyes had seen, and I had proved that scarce one half of thy wisdom had been told me: thou hast exceeded the same with thy <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Happy are thy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> are thy servants, who stand always before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, who hath been pleased to set thee on his throne, king of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>. Because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and will preserve them forever: therefore hath he made thee king over them, to do judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And she gave to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">most precious stones</a>: there were no such spices as these which the queen of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a> gave to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the servants also of Hiram, with the servants of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, brought gold from <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a>, and thyine trees, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">most precious stones</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the king made of the thyine trees stairs in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and in the king's house, and harps and psalteries for the singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: never were there seen such trees in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> gave to the queen of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a> all that she desired, and that she asked, and many more things than she brought to him: so she returned, and went to her own country with her servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the weight of the gold, that was brought to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> every year, was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Beside the sum which the deputies of divers nations, and the merchants were accustomed to bring, and all the kings of Arabia, and the lords of the lands, who brought gold and silver to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> made two hundred golden spears, of the sum of six hundred pieces of gold, which went to every spear:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And three hundred golden shields of three hundred pieces of gold, which went to the covering of every shield: and the king put them in the armoury, which was compassed with a wood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The king also made a great throne of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, and overlaid it with pure gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And six steps to go up to the throne, and a footstool of gold, and two arms one on either side, and two lions standing by the arms:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Moreover twelve other little lions standing upon the steps on both sides: there was not such a throne in any kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And all the vessels of the king's table were of gold, and the vessels of the house of the forest of Libanus were of the purest gold. For no account was made of silver in those days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For the king's ships went to Tharsis with the servants of Hiram, once in three years: and they brought thence gold and silver, and <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, and apes, and peacocks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> was magnified above all the kings of the earth for riches and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And all the kings of the earth desired to see the face of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, that they might hear the wisdom which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had given in his heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And every year they brought him presents, vessels of silver and of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, and horses, and mules.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had forty thousand horses in the stables, and twelve thousand chariots, and horsemen, and he placed them in the cities of the chariots and where the king was in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he exercised authority over all the kings from the river Euphrates to the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and to the borders of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he made silver as plentiful in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as stones: and <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a> as common as the sycamores, which grow in the plains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And horses were brought to him out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and out of all countries.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> first and last are written in the words of <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan the prophet</a>, and in the books of Ahias the Silonite, and in the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of Addo the seer, against <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> the son of Nabat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> reigned in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> forty years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he slept with his fathers: and they buried him in the city of David: and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
