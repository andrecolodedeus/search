<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is this: the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For we write no other things to you than what you have read and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And I <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> that you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> unto the end.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> As also you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> us in part, that we are your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: as you also are ours, in the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And to pass by you into Macedonia: and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is faithful: for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who was preached among you by us, by me and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not: It is and It is not. But, It is, was in him. <span class="stiki"><strong>It is, was in him...</strong> There was no inconstancy in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, sometimes, like modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">sectaries</a>, saying, It is, and at other times saying, It is not. But their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was ever the same, one uniform yea, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, one <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, that is, one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in him.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For all the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">promises of God</a> are in him, It is.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now he that confirmeth us with you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and that hath anointed us, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Who also hath sealed us and given the pledge of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> in our hearts.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But I call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness upon my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that to spare you, I came not any more to <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>: not because we exercise dominion over your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: but we are helpers of your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you stand.</span></p>
