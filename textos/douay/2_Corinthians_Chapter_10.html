<h1>2 Corinthians Chapter 10</h1>
<div class="h1a">To stop the calumny and boasting of false apostles, he set forth the power of his apostleship.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> according to the flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For the weapons of our <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> are not carnal but mighty to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And every height that exalteth itself against the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> shall be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> trust to himself, that he is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> let him think this again with himself, that as he is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>, so are we also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> hath given us unto edification and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistles</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> (For his <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistles</a> indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistles</a> when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For we dare not match or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves with ourselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But we will not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> beyond our measure: but according to the measure of the rule which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorying</a> beyond measure in other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> labours: but having <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of your increasing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Yea, unto those places that are beyond you to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>: not to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But he that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorieth</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For not he who commendeth himself is approved: but he, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commendeth.</span></p>
