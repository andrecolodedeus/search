<h1>2 Corinthians Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">He is forced to commend himself and his labours, lest the Corinthians should be imposed upon by the false apostles.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> you could bear with some little of my folly! But do bear with me. <span class="stiki"><strong>My folly...</strong> So he calls his reciting his own praises, which, commonly speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity; though the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> was constrained to do it, for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> committed to his charge.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For I am <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealous</a> of you with the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chaste</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But I fear lest, as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">serpent</a> seduced <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> by his subtilty, so your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For if he that cometh preacheth another <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, whom we have not preached; or if you receive another <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">Spirit</a>, whom you have not received; or another <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, which you have not received: you might well bear with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For although I be rude in speech, yet not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: but in all things we have been made manifest to you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Or did I commit a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">fault</a>, humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached unto you the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> freely?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> I have taken from other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, receiving wages of them for your <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And, when I was present with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia. And in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you: and so I will keep myself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in me, that this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorying</a> shall not be broken off in me in the regions of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Wherefore? Because I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you not? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But what I do, that I will do: that I may cut off the occasion from them that desire occasion: that wherein they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they may be found even as we.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For such <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And no wonder: for <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> himself transformeth himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Therefore it is no great thing if his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> be transformed as the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whose end shall be according to their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I say again (Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> think me to be foolish: otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> a little):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> That which I speak, I speak not according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but as it were in foolishness, in this matter of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorying</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Seeing that many <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> according to the flesh, I will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For you gladly suffer the foolish: whereas yourselves are wise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For you suffer if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bring you into <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a>, if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> devour you, if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take from you, if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be lifted up, if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> strike you on the face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I seek according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part. Wherein if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> They are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>: so am I. They are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>: so am I. They are the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: so am I.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> They are the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (I speak as one less wise): I am more; in many more labours, in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> more frequently, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> five times did I receive forty stripes save one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Thrice was I beaten with rods: once I was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>: thrice I suffered shipwreck: a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, in perils from <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">my own nation</a>, in perils from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in perils in the city, in perils in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, in perils in the sea, in perils from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> brethren:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger and thirst, in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> often, in cold and nakedness:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Besides those things which are without: my daily instance, the solicitude for all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>My daily instance...</strong> The labours that come in, and press upon me every day.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, and I am not on fire?</span>
