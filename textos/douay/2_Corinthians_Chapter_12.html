<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (whether in the body, or out of the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> That he was caught up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">paradise</a> and heard secret words which it is not granted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to utter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For such an one I will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: but for myself I will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> nothing but in my infirmities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For though I should have a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, I shall not be foolish: for I will say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But I forbear, lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And lest the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">angel of Satan</a>, to buffet me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For which thing, thrice I besought the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> that it might depart from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to me: My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for thee: for power is made <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in my infirmities, that the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> may dwell in me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Power is made perfect...</strong> The strength and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfectly</a> shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as the more weak we are of ourselves, the more illustrious is his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in supporting us, and giving us the victory under all trials and conflicts.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, in distresses, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I am become foolish. You have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you. For I have no way come short of them that are above measure <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, although I be nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Yet the signs of my <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostleship</a> have been wrought on you, in all patience, in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a> and mighty deeds.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For what is there that you have had less than the other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> for the children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: although <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> you more, I be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> less.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> I desired Titus: and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? Did we not in the same steps?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For I fear lest perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envyings</a>, animosities, dissensions, <a href="../cathen/04757a.htm">detractions</a>, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Lest again, when I come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> me among you: and I mourn many of them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before and have not done <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> and fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed.</span></p>
