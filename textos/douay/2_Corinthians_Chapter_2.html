<div class="h1a">He grants a pardon to the incestuous man upon his doing penance.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But I determined this with myself, to come to you again in sorrow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I wrote this same to you: that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of you all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> I have more abundantly towards you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me: but in part, that I may not burden you all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Wherefore, I beseech you that you would confirm your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For to this end also did I write, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the experiment of you, whether you be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> in all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>I also...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> here granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, or pardon, in the person and by the authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">incestuous</a> <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinthian</a>, whom before he had put under <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, which pardon consisted in a releasing of part of the temporal punishment due to his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> That we be not overreached by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. For we are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his devices.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when I was come to <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and a door was opened unto me in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I had no rest in my <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, because I found not Titus my brother: but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who always maketh us to triumph in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> and manifesteth the odour of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by us in every place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For we are the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> odour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in them that are <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a> and in them that perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient? <span class="stiki"><strong>The odour of death, etc...</strong> The preaching of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a>, which by its fragrant odour, brought many to life, was to others, through their own fault, the occasion of death; by their wilfully opposing and resisting that divine call.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For we are not as many, adulterating the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but with sincerity: but as from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> we speak.</span></p>
