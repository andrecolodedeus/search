<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a house not made with hands, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now he that maketh us for this very thing is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hath given us the pledge of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore having always confidence, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that while we are in the body we are absent from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> (For we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not by sight.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But we are confident and have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The proper things of the body...</strong> In the <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular judgment</a>, immediately after death, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is rewarded or punished according to what it has done in the body.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore the fear of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, we use persuasion to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we are manifest. And I trust also that in your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> we are manifest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in our behalf: that you may have somewhat to answer them who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in face, and not in heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For whether we be transported in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: or whether we be sober, it is for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for all: that they also who live may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Wherefore henceforth, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to the flesh. And if we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to the flesh: but now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him so no longer. <span class="stiki"><strong>We know no man according to the flesh...</strong> That is, we consider not any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with regard to his nation, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, kindred, or other natural qualities or advantages; but only with relation to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and according to the order of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">divine charity</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> adds, that even with respect to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself, he now no longer considers him according to the flesh, by taking a satisfaction in his being his countryman; his affection being now purified from all such earthly considerations.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> If then any be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> a new creature, the old things are passed away. Behold all things are made new.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But all things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hath reconciled us to himself by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> therefore we are ambassadors, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as it were exhorting by us, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we beseech you, be reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Him, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he hath made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us: that we might be made the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Sin for us...</strong> That is, to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a>, a victim for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></span></p>
