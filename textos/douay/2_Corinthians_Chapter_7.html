<div class="h1a">The apostle's affection for the Corinthians. His comfort and joy on their account.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Having therefore these <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a>, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfecting</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctification</a> in the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Receive us. We have injured no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: we have corrupted no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: we have overreached no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before that you are in our hearts: to die together and to live together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Great is my confidence for you: great is my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorying</a> for you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in all our tribulation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For also, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest: but we suffered all tribulation. Combats without: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fears</a> within.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who comforteth the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, comforted us by the coming of Titus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for me: so that I rejoiced the more.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For although I made you sorrowful by my <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a>, I do not repent. And if I did repent, seeing that the same <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>. For you were made sorrowful according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For the sorrow that is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> worketh <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, steadfast unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how great carefulness it worketh in you: yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, yea revenge. In all things you have showed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it: but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation we did the more abundantly rejoice for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of Titus, because his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> was refreshed by you all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame: but as we have spoken all things to you in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And his bowels are more abundantly towards you: remembering the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of you all, how with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear and trembling</a> you received him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you.</span></p>
