<div class="h1a">He exhorts them to contribute bountifully to relieve the poor of Jerusalem.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now we make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you, brethren, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that hath been given in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> of Macedonia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and their very deep <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty</a> hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity. <span class="stiki"><strong>Simplicity...</strong> That is, sincere bounty and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For according to their power (I bear them witness) and beyond their power, they were willing:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> With much entreaty begging of us the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and communication of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> that is done toward the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And not as we hoped: but they gave their own selves, first to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, then to us by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that, as he had begun, so also he would finish among you this same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> That as in all things you abound in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and word and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and all carefulness, moreover also in your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards us: so in this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also you may abound.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> I speak not as commanding: but by the carefulness of others, approving also the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> disposition of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that being rich he became <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> for your sakes: that through his <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty</a> you might be rich.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And herein I give my advice: for this is profitable for you who have begun not only to do but also to be willing, a year ago.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now therefore perform ye it also in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deed</a>: that as your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be forward, it is accepted according to that which a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath: not according to that which he hath not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For I mean not that others should be eased and you burdened, but by an equality.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want: that there may be an equality,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> As it is written: He that had much had nothing over; and he that had little had no want.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For indeed he accepted the exhortation: but, being more careful, of his own <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> he went unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> We have sent also with him the brother whose praise is in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> through all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And not that only: but he was also ordained by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> companion of our travels, for this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is administered by us, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> and our determined <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Avoiding this, lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For we forecast what may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not only before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but also before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent: with much confidence in you,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Wherefore show ye to them, in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, the evidence of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and of our boasting on your behalf.</span></p>
