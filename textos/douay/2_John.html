<h1>2 John</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Second Epistle of St. John the Apostle</div>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Apostle</a> commends Electa and her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> for their steadfastness in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and exhorts them to persevere, lest they lose the reward of their labours. He exhorts them to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. But with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to have no society, even not to salute them. Although this <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistle</a> is written to a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, yet its instructions may serve as a lesson to others, especially to those who, from their connections, situation, or condition in life, are in danger of perversion. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08435a.htm">EPISTLES OF JOHN</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)
