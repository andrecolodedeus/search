<h1>2 Kings</h1>

<h2>The Second Book of Kings, also called the Fourth Book of Kings</h2>

<p>This and the previous book are called by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">holy fathers</a> the third and fourth book of Kings; but by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, the first and second. They contain the history of the kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, from the beginning of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>. As to the writer of these books, it seems most probable they were not written by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; nor at one time; but as there was all along a succession of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who recorded, by <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">divine inspiration</a>, the most remarkable things that happened in their days, these books seem to have been written by these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. See <a href="../douay/2ch009.htm#verse29">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch012.htm#verse15">12:15</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch013.htm#verse22">13:22</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch020.htm#verse34">20:34</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch026.htm#verse22">26:22</a>; <a href="../douay/2ch032.htm#verse32">32:32</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08652a.htm">THIRD AND FOURTH KINGS</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/2ki001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> Ochozias sendeth to consult Beelzebub: Elias foretelleth his death: and causeth fire to come down from heaven, upon two captains and their companies.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> Eliseus will not part from Elias. The water of the Jordan is divided by Elias' cloak. Elias is taken up in a fiery chariot, and his double spirit is given to Eliseus. Eliseus healeth the waters by casting in salt. Boys are torn by bears for mocking Eliseus.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> The kings of Israel, Juda, and Edom, fight against the king of Moab. They want water, which Eliseus procureth without rain: and prophesieth victory. The king of Moab is overthrown, his city is besieged: he sacrificeth his firstborn son: so the Israelites raise the siege.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Miracles of Eliseus. He raiseth a dead child to life.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> Naaman the Syrian is cleansed of his leprosy. He professeth his belief in one God, promising to serve him. Giezi taketh gifts of Naaman, and is struck with leprosy.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> Eliseus maketh iron to swim upon the water: he leadeth the Syrians that were sent to apprehend him into Samaria, where there eyes being opened, they are courteously entertained. The Syrians besiege Samaria: the famine there causeth a woman to eat her own child. Upon this the king commandeth Eliseus to be put to death.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> Eliseus prophesieth a great plenty, which presently ensueth upon the sudden flight of the Syrians; of which four lepers bring the news to the city. The incredulous nobleman is trod to death.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> After seven years' famine foretold by Eliseus, the Sunamitess returning home, recovereth her lands, and revenues. Eliseus foreshoweth the death of Benadad, king of Syria, and the reign of Hazael. Joram's wicked reign in Juda. He dieth, and his son Ochozias succeedeth.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> Jehu is anointed king of Israel, to destroy the house of Achab and Jezebel. He killeth Joram king of Israel, and Ochozias king of Juda. Jezebel is eaten by dogs.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> Jehu destroyeth the house of Achab: abolisheth the worship of Baal, and killeth the worshippers: but sticketh to the calves of Jeroboam. Israel is afflicted by the Syrians.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> Athalia's usurpation and tyranny. Joas is made king. Athalia is slain.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> The temple is repaired. Hazael is bought off from attacking Jerusalem. Joas is slain.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> The reign of Joachaz and of Joas kings of Israel. The last acts and death of Eliseus the prophet: a dead man is raised to life by the touch of his bones.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> Amasias reigneth in Juda: he overcometh the Edomites: but is overcome by Joas king of Israel. Jeroboam the second reigneth in Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> The reign of Azarias, and Joatham in Juda: and of Zacharias, Sellum, Manahem, Phaceia, and Phacee in Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> The wicked reign of Achaz: the kings of Syria and Israel war against him: he hireth the king of the Assyrians to assist him: he causeth an altar to be made after the pattern of that of Damascus.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> The reign of Osee. The Israelites for their sins are carried into captivity: other inhabitants are sent to Samaria, who make a mixture of religion.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> The reign of Ezechias: he abolisheth idolatry and prospereth. Sennacherib cometh up against him: Rabsaces soliciteth the people to revolt; and blasphemeth the Lord.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> Ezechias is assured of God's help by Isaias the prophet. The king of the Assyrians still threateneth and blasphemeth. Ezechias prayeth, and God promiseth to protect Jerusalem. An angel destroyeth the army of the Assyrians, their king returneth to Ninive, and is slain by his two sons.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> Ezechias being sick, is told by Isaias that he shall die; but praying to God, he obtaineth longer life, and in confirmation thereof receiveth a sign by the sun's returning back. He showeth all his treasures to the ambassadors of the king of Babylon: Isaias reproving him for it, foretelleth the Babylonish captivity.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> The wickedness of Manasses: God's threats by his prophets. His wicked son Amon succeedeth him, and is slain by his servants.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> Josias repaireth the temple. The book of the law is found, upon which they consult the Lord, and are told that great evils shall fall upon them, but not in the time of Josias.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki023.htm"><strong>Chapter 23.</strong></a> Josias readeth the law before all the people. They promise to observe it. He abolisheth all idolatry, celebrateth the phase: is slain in battle by the king of Egypt. The short reign of Joachaz, in whose place Joakim is made king.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki024.htm"><strong>Chapter 24.</strong></a> The reign of Joakim, Joachin, and Sedecias.
<br><a href="../douay/2ki025.htm"><strong>Chapter 25.</strong></a> Jerusalem is besieged and taken by Nabuchodonosor: Sedecias is taken: the city and temple are destroyed. Godolias, who is left governor, is slain. Joachin is exalted by Evilmerodach.
