<div class="h1a">Ochozias sends to consult Beelzebub: Elias foretells his death: and causes fire to come down from heaven, upon two captains and their companies.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> rebelled against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, after the death of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Ochozias fell through the lattices of his upper chamber, which he had in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and was sick: and he sent messengers, saying to them: Go, consult <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the god of <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>, whether I shall recover of this my illness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, the Thesbite, saying: Arise, and go up to meet the messengers of the king of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and say to them: Is there not a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that ye go to consult <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the god of <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Wherefore, thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: From the bed, on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die. And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> went away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the messengers turned back to Ochozias. And he said to them: Why are you come back?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But they answered him: A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> met us, and said to us: Go, and return to the king, that sent you, and you shall say to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Is it because there was no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that thou sendest to <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the god of <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>? Therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed, on which thou art gone up, but thou shalt surely die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to them: What manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was he who met you, and spoke these words?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But they said: A hairy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said: It is <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, the Thesbite.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he sent to him a <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of fifty, and the fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were under him. And he went up to him, and as he was sitting on the top of a hill, he said to him: Man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the king hath commanded that thou come down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> answering, said to the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of fifty: If I be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let fire come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and consume thee, and thy fifty. And there came down fire from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and consumed him, and the fifty that were with him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let fire, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> was inspired to call for fire from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> upon these <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, who came to apprehend him; not out of a desire to gratify any private <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>; but to punish the insult offered to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>, to confirm his mission, and to show how vain are the efforts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his servants, whom he willeth to protect.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he again sent to him another <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and his fifty with him. And he said to him: Man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: Thus saith the king: Make haste and come down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> answering, said: If I be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let fire come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and consume thee, and thy fifty. And fire came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and consumed him and his fifty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Again he sent a third <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the fifty that were with him. And when he was come, he fell upon his knees before <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and besought him, and said: Man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> not my life, and the lives of thy servants that are with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Behold fire came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and consumed the two first <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the fifties that were with them: but now I beseech thee to spare my life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, saying: Go down with him, fear not. He arose therefore, and went down with him to the king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And said to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Because thou hast sent messengers to consult <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the god of <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>, as though there were not a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, of whom thou mightest inquire the word; therefore, from the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So he died, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> spoke; and Joram, his brother, reigned in his stead, in the second year of Joram, the son of Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, because he had no son. <span class="stiki"><strong>The second year of Joram, etc...</strong> Counted from the time that he was associated to the throne by his father Josaphat.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But the rest of the acts of Ochozias, which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span></p>
