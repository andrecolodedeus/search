<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> had seventy sons in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: so <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> wrote <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>, and sent to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, to the chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the city, and to the ancients, and to them that brought up <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab's</a> children, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> As soon as you receive these <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>, ye that have your master's sons, and chariots, and horses, and fenced cities, and armour,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Choose the best, and him that shall please you most of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for the house of your master.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But they were exceedingly afraid, and said: Behold two kings could not stand before him, and how shall we be able to resist?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Therefore they that were over the king's house, and the rulers of the city, and the ancients, and the bringers up of the children, sent to <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, saying: We are thy servants: whatsoever thou shalt command us we will do; we will not make us any king: do thou all that pleaseth thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he wrote <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> the second time to them, saying: If you be mine, and will <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me, take the heads of the sons of your master, and come to me to Jezrahel by tomorrow at this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, were brought up with the chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> came to them, they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezrahel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And a messenger came, and told him, saying: They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said: Lay ye them in two heaps by the entering in of the gate until the morning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when it was light, he went out, and standing, said to all the people: You are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: if I conspired against my master, and slew him; who hath slain all these?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> See therefore now that there hath not fallen to the ground any of the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke concerning the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath done that which he spoke in the hand of his servant <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> So <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> slew all that were left of the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> in Jezrahel, and all his chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and his friends, and his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, till there were no remains left of him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he arose, and went to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: and when he was come to the shepherds' cabin in the way,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He met with the brethren of Ochozias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and he said to them: Who are you? And they answered: We are the brethren of Ochozias, and are come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he said: Take them alive. And they took them alive, and killed them at the pit by the cabin, two and forty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and he left not any of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when he was departed thence, he found Jonadab, the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, coming to meet him, and he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him. And he said to him: Is thy heart right as my heart is with thy heart? And Jonadab said: It is. If it be, said he, give me thy hand. He gave him his hand. And he lifted him up to him into the chariot,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And said to him: Come with me, and see my zeal for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. So he made him ride in his chariot,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And brought him into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. And he slew all that were left of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> which he spoke by <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> gathered together all the people, and said to them: <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> worshipped <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> a little, but I will worship him more. <span class="stiki"><strong>I will worship him more...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in thus pretending to worship <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and causing <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to be offered to him: because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not to be done, that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may come of it. <a href="../douay/rom003.htm#verse8">Romans 3:8</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now therefore call to me all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and all his servants, and all his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: let none be wanting, for I have a great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to offer to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>: whosoever shall be wanting, shall not live. Now <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> did this craftily, that he might destroy the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he said: Proclaim a festival for <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>. And he called,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he sent into all the borders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and all the servants of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> came: there was not one left that did not come. And they went into the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>: and the house of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> was filled, from one end to the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said to them that were over the wardrobe: Bring forth garments for all the servants of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>. And they brought them forth garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, and Jonadab, the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, went to the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and said to the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>: Search, and see that there be not any with you of the servants of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but that there be the servants of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> only.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they went in to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and burnt <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>: but <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> had prepared him fourscore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> without, and said to them: If any of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> escape, whom I have brought into your hands, he that letteth him go, shall answer life for life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And it came to pass, when the burnt <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> was ended, that <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> commanded his soldiers and <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, saying: Go in, and kill them: let none escape. And the soldiers and <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> slew them with the edge of the sword, and cast them out: and they went into the city of the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And brought the statue out of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal's</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a>, and burnt it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And broke it in pieces. They destroyed also the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and made a jakes in its place unto this day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> destroyed <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But yet he departed not from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, who made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor did he forsake the golden calves that were in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>: because thou hast diligently executed that which was right and pleasing in my eyes, and hast done to the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> according to all that was in my heart: thy children shall sit upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to the fourth <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> took no heed to walk in the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, with all his heart: for he departed not from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, who had made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> In those days the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> began to be weary of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and Hazael ravaged them in all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> From the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> eastward, all the land of Galaad, and <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, from Aroer, which is upon the torrent Arnon, and Galaad, and Basan.</span>
