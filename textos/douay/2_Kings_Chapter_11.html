<h1>2 Kings Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">Athalia's usurpation and tyranny. Joas is made king. Athalia is slain.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now Athalia, the mother of Ochozias, seeing that her son was dead, arose and slew all the royal seed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But Josaba the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, took Joas, the son of Ochozias, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, out of the bedchamber with his nurse: and hid him from the face of Athalia; so that he was not slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he was with her six years, hid in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>. And Athalia reigned over the land.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And in the seventh year Joiada sent, and taking the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a> and soldiers, brought them in to him into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and made a covenant with them: and taking an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of them in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, showed them the king's son:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he commanded them, saying: This is the thing that you must do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Let a third part of you go in on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and keep the watch of the king's house. And let a third part be at the gate of Sur; and let a third part be at the gate behind the dwelling of the shieldbearers; and you shall keep the watch of the house of Messa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But let two parts of you all that go forth on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, keep the watch of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> about the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And you shall compass him round about, having weapons in your hands: and if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall enter the precinct of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, let him be slain: and you shall be with the king, coming in and going out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a> did according to all things that Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, had commanded them: and taking every one their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that went in on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, with them that went out in the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, came to Joiada, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he gave them the spears, and the arms of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, which were in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they stood, having every one their weapons in their hands, from the right side of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, unto the left side of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, about the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he brought forth the king's son, and put the diadem upon him, and the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">testimony</a>: and they made him king, and anointed him: and clapping their hands, they said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save the king. <span class="stiki"><strong>The testimony...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">book of the law</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Athalia heard the noise of the people running: and going in to the people into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> She saw the king standing upon a tribunal, as the manner was, and the singers, and the trumpets near him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding the trumpets: and she rent her garments, and cried: A conspiracy, a conspiracy. <span class="stiki"><strong>A tribunal...</strong> A tribune, or a place elevated above the rest.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But Joiada commanded the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a> that were over the army, and said to them: Have her forth without the precinct of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and whosoever shall follow her, let him be slain with the sword. For the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> had said: Let her not be slain in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they laid hands on her: and thrust her out by the way by which the horses go in, by the palace, and she was slain there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Joiada made a covenant between the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the king, and the people, that they should be the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; and between the king and the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And all the people of the land went into the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and broke down his <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly: they slew also Mathan the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> set guards in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he took the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a>, and the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and they came by the way of the gate of the shieldbearers into the palace, and he sat on the throne of the kings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: but Athalia was slain with the sword in the king's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now Joas was seven years old when he began to reign.</span></p>
