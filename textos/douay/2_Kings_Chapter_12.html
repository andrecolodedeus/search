<div class="h1a">The temple is repaired. Hazael is bought off from attacking Jerusalem. Joas is slain.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the seventh year of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, Joas began to reign: and he reigned forty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Sebia, of <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Joas did that which was right before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> all the days that Joiada, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, taught him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But yet he took not away the high places: for the people still <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the high places.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Joas said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: all the money of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> things, which is brought into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a> by those that pass, which is offered for the price of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and which of their own accord, and of their own free heart, they bring into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>Sanctified...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service. -- Ibid. <strong>The price of a soul...</strong> That is, the ordinary <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a>, which every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was to offer by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>. <a href="../douay/exo030.htm">Exodus 30</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> take it according to their order and repair the house, wheresoever they shall see any thing that wanteth repairing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now till the three and twentieth year of king Joas the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> did not make the repairs of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And king Joas called Joiada, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, saying to them: Why do you not repair the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>? Take you, therefore, money no more according to your order, but restore it for the repairing of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were forbidden to take any more money of the people, and to make the repairs of the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joiada, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, took a chest, and bored a hole in the top, and set it by the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> at the right hand of them that came into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that kept the doors, put therein all the money that was brought to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when they saw that there was very much money in the chest, the king's scribe, and the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, came up, and poured it out, and counted the money that was found in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they gave it out by number and measure into the hands of them that were over the builders of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and they laid it out to the carpenters, and the masons, that wrought in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And made the repairs: and to them that cut stones, and to buy timber, and stones to be hewed, that the repairs of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> might be completely finished, and wheresoever there was need of expenses to uphold the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But there were not made of the same money for the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, bowls, or fleshhooks, or <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, or trumpets, or any vessel of gold and silver, of the money that was brought into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For it was given to them that did the work, that the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a> might be repaired.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they reckoned not with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that received the money to distribute it to the workmen, but they bestowed it faithfully.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But the money for trespass, and the money for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they brought not into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, because it was for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then Hazael, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, went up, and fought against Geth, and took it, and set his face to go up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Wherefore Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, took all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> things, which Josaphat, and Joram, and Ochozias, his fathers, the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, had <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> uses, and which he himself had offered: and all the silver that could be found in the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and in the king's palace: and sent it to Hazael, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and he went off from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And his servants arose, and conspired among themselves, and slew Joas, in the house of Mello, in the descent of Sella.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For Josachar the son of Semaath, and Jozabad the son of Somer his servant, struck him, and he died: and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; and Amasias, his son, reigned in his stead. <span class="stiki"><strong>The city of David...</strong> He was buried in the same city with his fathers, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. <a href="../douay/2ch014.htm">2 Chronicles 14</a>.</span></span></p>
