<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the three and twentieth year of Joas son of Ochozias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, Joachaz, the son of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, seventeen years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and followed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, who made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and he departed not from them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was kindled against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael, the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and into the hand of Benadad, the son of Hazael, all days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But Joachaz besought the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard him: for he saw the distress of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> had oppressed them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> a saviour, and they were delivered out of the hand of the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> dwelt in their pavilions as yesterday and the day before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But yet they departed not from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, who made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but walked in them: and there still remained a grove also in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>A grove...</strong> Dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship of idols</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Joachaz had no more left of the people than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen: for the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> had slain them, and had brought them low as dust by threshing in the barnfloor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the rest of the acts of Joachaz, and all that he did, and his valour, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joachaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: and Joas, his son, reigned in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> In the seven and thirtieth year of Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, Joas the son of Joachaz reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, sixteen years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he did that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: he departed not from all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, who made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but he walked in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, and his valour wherewith he fought against Amasias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Joas slept with his fathers; and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> sat upon his throne. But Joas was buried in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, with the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> was sick of the illness whereof he died: and Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, went down to him, and wept before him, and said: O my father, my father, the chariot of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the guider thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said to him: Bring a bow and arrows. And when he had brought him a bow and arrows,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He said to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Put thy hand upon the bow. And when he had put his hand, <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> put his hands over the king's hands,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And said: Open the window to the east. And when he had opened it, <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said: Shoot an arrow. And he shot. And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said: The arrow of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> deliverance, and the arrow of the deliverance from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>: and thou shalt strike the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> in Aphec, till thou consume them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said: Take the arrows. And when he had taken them, he said to him: Strike with an arrow upon the ground. And he struck three times, and stood still.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him, and said: If thou hadst smitten five or six or seven times, thou hadst smitten <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> even to utter destruction: but now three times shalt thou smite it. <span class="stiki"><strong>If thou hadst smitten, etc...</strong> By this it appears that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that the king should overcome the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> as many times as he should then strike on the ground; but as he had not at the same time revealed to him how often the king would strike, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was concerned to see that he struck but thrice.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> died, and they buried him. And the rovers from <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> came into the land the same year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And some that were burying a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, saw the rovers, and cast the body into the sepulchre of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>. And when it had touched the bones of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> came to life and stood upon his feet.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now Hazael, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, afflicted <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> all the days of Joachaz.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had mercy on them, and returned to them, because of his covenant, which he had made with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: and he would not destroy them, nor utterly cast them away, unto this present time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Hazael, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, died; and Benadad, his son, reigned in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Now Joas the son of Joachaz, took the cities out of the hand of Benadad, the son of Hazael, which he had taken out of the hand of Joachaz, his father, by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; three times did Joas beat him, and he restored the cities to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
