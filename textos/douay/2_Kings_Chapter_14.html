<h1>2 Kings Chapter 14</h1>
<div class="h1a">Amasias reigns in Judah: he overcomes the Edomites: but is overcome by Joas king of Israel. Jeroboam the second reigns in Israel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the second year of Joas son of Joachaz, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, reigned Amasias son of Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign; and nine and twenty years he reigned in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Joadan, of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he did that which was right before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but yet not like <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his father. He did according to all things that Joas his father, did:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But this only, that he took not away the high places; for yet the people <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the high places:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when he had possession of the kingdom, he put his servants to death that had slain the king, his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But the children of the murderers he did not put to death, according to that which is written in the book of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, wherein the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded, saying: The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: but every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall die for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He slew of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> in the valley of the Saltpits, ten thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and took the rock by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof Jectehel, unto this day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: Come, let us see one another. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let us see one another...</strong> This was a challenge to fight.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, sent again to Amasias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saying: A thistle of Libanus sent to a <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar tree</a>, which is in Libanus, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife. And the beasts of the forest, that are in Libanus, passed, and trod down the thistle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Thou hast beaten and prevailed over <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, and thy heart hath lifted thee up; be content with this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and sit at home; why provokest thou <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that thou shouldst fall, and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> with thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But Amasias did not rest satisfied. So Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, went up; and he and Amasias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saw one another in Bethsames, a town in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> was put to the worse before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they fled every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to their dwellings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, took Amasias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, the son of Joas, the son of Ochozias, in Bethsames, and brought him into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; and he broke down the wall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, from the gate of Ephraim to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and in the king's treasures, and hostages, and returned to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the rest of the acts of Joas, which he did, and his valour, wherewith he fought against Amasias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Joas slept with his fathers, and was buried in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, with the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, his son, reigned in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Amasias, the son of Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, lived after the death of Joas, son of Joachaz, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, fifteen years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the rest of the acts of Amasias, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now they made a conspiracy against him in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and he fled to Lachis. And they sent after him to Lachis, and killed him there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they brought him away upon horses, and he was buried in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with his fathers, in the city of David.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And all the people of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father, Amasias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He built Elath, and restored it to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, after that the king slept with his fathers.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> In the fifteenth year of Amasias, son of Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, reigned <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Joas, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, one and forty years:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he did that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. He departed not from all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, who made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He restored the borders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the entrance of Emath, unto the sea of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which he spoke by his servant, Jonas, the son of Amathi, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who was of Geth, which is in <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Opher</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Opher...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">tribe of Zabulon</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saw the affliction of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that it was exceedingly bitter, and that they were consumed even to them that were shut up in prison, and the lowest persons, and that there was no one to help <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> did not say that he would blot out the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; but he saved them by the hand of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Joas.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, and all that he did, and his valour, wherewith he fought, and how he restored <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> and Emath to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> slept with his fathers, the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; and Zacharias, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
