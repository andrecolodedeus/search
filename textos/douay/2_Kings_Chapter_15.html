<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the seven and twentieth year of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, reigned Azarias, son of Amasias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Azarias...</strong> Otherwise called <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Jechelia, of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he did that which was pleasing before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, according to all that his father, Amasias, had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the high places he did not destroy, for the people <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the high places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> struck the king, so that he was a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> unto the day of his death, and he dwelt in a free house apart: but Joatham, the king's son, governed the palace, and judged the people of the land. <span class="stiki"><strong>A leper...</strong> In punishment of his usurping the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> function. <a href="../douay/2ch026.htm">2 Chronicles 26</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the rest of the acts of Azarias, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Azarias slept with his fathers: and they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David, and Joatham, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> In the eight and thirtieth year of Azarias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, reigned Zacharias, son of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, six months:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/09583a.htm">Manahem, the son of Gadi</a>, went up from Thersa, and he came into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and struck Sellum, the son of Jabes, in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Phul, king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, came into the land, and <a href="../cathen/09583a.htm">Manahem</a> gave Phul a thousand talents of silver to aid him and to establish him in the kingdom.</span>
