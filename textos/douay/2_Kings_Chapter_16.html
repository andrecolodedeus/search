<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the seventeenth year of Phacee, the son of Romelia reigned <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a>, the son of Joatham, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: he did not that which was pleasing in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But he walked in the way of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: moreover, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> also his son, making him pass through the fire, according to the idols of the nations which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> also, and burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then Rasin, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Phacee, son of Romelia, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, came up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to fight: and they besieged <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a>, but were not able to overcome him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> At that time Rasin, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, restored Aila to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and drove the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> out of Aila: and the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a> came into Aila, and dwelt there unto this day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> sent messengers to Theglathphalasar, king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, saying: I am thy servant, and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and out of the hand of the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who are risen up together against me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when he had gathered together the silver and gold that could be found in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and in the king's treasures, he sent it for a present to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he agreed to his desire: for the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> went up against <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and laid it waste: and he carried away the inhabitants thereof to Cyrene; but Rasin he slew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> went to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> to meet Theglathphalasar, king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and when he had seen the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> sent to Urias, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a pattern of it, and its likeness, according to all the work thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Urias, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, built an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> according to all that <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> had commanded from <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> so did Urias, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, until <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> came from <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when the king was come from <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, he saw the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> and worshipped it: and went up and offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and his own <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he offered libations, and poured the blood of the peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, which he had offered, upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of brass that was before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he removed from the face of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and from the place of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and from the place of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>: and he set it at the side of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> towards the north.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> commanded Urias, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, saying: Upon the great <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> offer the morning <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and the evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and the king's <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> of the whole people of the land, and their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and their libations: and all the blood of the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and all the blood of the victim, thou shalt pour out upon it: but the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of brass shall be ready at my pleasure.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So Urias, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, did according to all that <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> had commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">king Achaz</a> took away the graven bases, and the laver that was upon them: and he took down the sea from the brazen oxen that held it up, and put it upon a pavement of stone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The Musach also for the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, which he had built in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and the king's entry from without, he turned into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, because of the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Musach...</strong> The covert, or pavilion, or tribune, for the king.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
