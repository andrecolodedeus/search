<div class="h1a">The reign of Osee. The Israelites for their sins are carried into captivity: other inhabitants are sent to Samaria, who make a mixture of religion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the twelfth year of <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, Osee the son of Ela reigned in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, nine years. <span class="stiki"><strong>In the twelfth year of Achaz king of Juda...</strong> He began to reign before: but was not in quiet possession of the kingdom to the twelfth year of <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: but not as the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that had been before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Against him came up Salmanasar, king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>; and Osee became his servant, and paid him tribute.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> found that Osee, endeavouring to rebel, had sent messengers to Sua, the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that he might not pay tribute to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, as he had done every year, he besieged him, bound him, and cast him into prison.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he went through all the land: and going up to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, he besieged it three years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And in the ninth year of Osee, the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> took <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and carried <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> away to <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>: and he placed them in Hala, and <a href="../cathen/07103a.htm">Habor</a>, by the river of Gozan, in the cities of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For so it was that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from under the hand of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and they worshipped strange gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they walked according to the way of the nations which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had destroyed in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: because they had done in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> offended the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with things that were not right: and built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they made them statues and groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> there upon <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, after the manner of the nations which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had removed from their face: and they did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things, provoking the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they worshipped abominations, concerning which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded them that they should not do this thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> testified to them in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, by the hand of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and seers, saying: Return from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ways, and keep my precepts, and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers: and as I have sent to you in the hand of my servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they hearkened not, but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers, who would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they rejected his ordinances, and the covenant that he made with their fathers, and the testimonies which he testified against them: and they followed vanities, and acted vainly: and they followed the nations that were round about them, concerning which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded them that they should not do as they did.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they forsook all the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and made to themselves two molten calves, and groves, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> all the host of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and they served <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> their sons, and their daughters, through fire: and they gave themselves to divinations, and soothsayings: and they delivered themselves up to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to provoke him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and removed them from his sight, and there remained only the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But neither did <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> itself keep the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but they walked in the errors of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which they had wrought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> cast off all the seed of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, till he cast them away from his face:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Even from that time, when <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was rent from the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and made <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, son of Nabat, their king: for <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> separated <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and made them commit a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> walked in all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, which he had done: and they departed not from them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Till the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> removed <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from his face, as he had spoken in the hand of all his servants, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was carried away out of their land to <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, unto this day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> brought people from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and from Cutha, and from Avah, and from Emath, and from Sepharvaim: and placed them in the cities of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> instead of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: and they possessed <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when they began to dwell there, they feared not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent lions among them, which killed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And it was told the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and it was said: The nations which thou hast removed, and made to dwell in the cities of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, know not the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the land: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath sent lions among them: and behold they kill them, because they know not the manner of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> commanded, saying: Carry thither one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whom you brought from thence captive, and let him go, and dwell with them: and let him teach them the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who had been carried away captive from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, came and dwelt in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and taught them how they should worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And every nation made gods of their own and put them in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of the high places, which the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> had made, every nation in their cities where they dwelt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> made Sochothbenoth: and the Cuthites made Nergel: and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Emath made Asima.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the Hevites made Nebahaz, and Tharthac. And they that were of Sepharvaim burnt their children in fire, to <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adramelech</a> and Anamelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And nevertheless they worshipped the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And they made to themselves, of the lowest of the people, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the high places, and they placed them in the temples of the high places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And when they worshipped the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, they served also their own gods, according to the custom of the nations out of which they were brought to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Unto this day they follow the old manner: they fear not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, neither do they keep his <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Jacob</a>, whom he surnamed <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> With whom he made a covenant, and charged them, saying: You shall not fear strange gods, nor shall you <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them, nor worship them, nor <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who brought you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, with great power, and a stretched out arm, him shall you fear, and him shall you <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>, and to him shall you <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do them always: and you shall not fear strange gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And the covenant that he made with you, you shall not forget: neither shall ye worship strange Gods,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But they did not hearken to them, but did according to their old custom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> So these nations feared the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but nevertheless served also their idols: their children also, and grandchildren, as their fathers did, so do they unto this day.</span></p>
