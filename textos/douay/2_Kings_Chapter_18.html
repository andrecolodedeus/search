<div class="h1a">The reign of Hezekiah: he abolishes idolatry and prospers. Sennacherib comes up against him: Rabsaces solicits the people to revolt; and blasphemes the Lord.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the third year of Osee, the son of Ela, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, reigned <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned nine and twenty years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Abi, the daughter of Zacharias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he did that which was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, according to all that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, his father, had done:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He destroyed the high places, and broke the statues in pieces, and cut down the groves, and broke the brazen serpent, which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had made: for till that time the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to it: and he called its <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Nohestan. <span class="stiki"><strong>And he called its name Noheston...</strong> That is, their brass; or a little brass. So he called it in contempt, because they had made an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> of it.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He trusted in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, nor any of them that were before him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he stuck to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and departed not from his steps, but kept his commandments, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also was with him, and in all things, to which he went forth, he behaved himself wisely. And he rebelled against the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and served him not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He smote the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> as far as <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and all their borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> In the fourth year of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">king Ezechias</a>, which was the seventh year of Osee, the son of Ela, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, Salmanasar, king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, came up to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and besieged it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And took it. For after three years, in the sixth year of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, that is, in the ninth year of Osee, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> was taken:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> carried away <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> into <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, and placed them in Hala, and in <a href="../cathen/07103a.htm">Habor</a>, by the rivers of Gozan, in the cities of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Because they hearkened not to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but transgressed his covenant: all that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the servant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, commanded, they would not hear, nor do.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> In the fourteenth year of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">king Ezechias</a>, Sennacherib, king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, came up against the fenced cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and took them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, sent messengers to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, to Lachis, saying: I have offended, depart from me: and all that thou shalt put upon me, I will bear. And the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> put a tax upon <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, of three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> gave all the silver that was found in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and in the king's treasures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> broke the doors of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and the plates of gold which he had fastened on them, and gave them to the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> sent Tharthan, and Rabsaris, and Rabsaces, from Lachis, to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">king Ezechias</a>, with a strong army, to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and they went up and came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and they stood by the conduit of the upper <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a>, which is in the way of the fuller's field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they called for the king: and there went out to them Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna, the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Rabsaces said to them: Speak to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>: Thus saith the great king, the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>: What is this confidence, wherein thou trustest?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Perhaps thou hast taken counsel, to prepare thyself for battle. On whom dost thou trust, that thou darest to rebel?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Dost thou trust in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> a staff of a broken reed, upon which if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lean, it will break and go into his hand, and pierce it? so is <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to all that trust in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But if you say to me: We trust in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: is it not he, whose high places and <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> hath taken away: and hath commanded <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: You shall worship before this <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now therefore come over to my master, the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and I will give you two thousand horses, and see whether you be able to have riders for them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And how can you stand against one lord of the least of my master's servants? Dost thou trust in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> for chariots and for horsemen?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Is it without the will of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that I am come up to this place to destroy it? The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Go up to this land, and destroy it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe, said to Rabsaces: We pray thee, speak to us, thy servants, in <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a>: for we understand that tongue: and speak not to us in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Jews' language</a>, in the hearing of the people that are upon the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Rabsaces answered them, saying: Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words, and not rather to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their urine with you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a loud voice in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Jews' language</a>, and said: Hear the word of the great king, the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Thus saith the king: Let not <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of my hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Neither let him make you trust in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Do not hearken to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>. For thus saith the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>: Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come out to me: and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of you shall eat of his own vineyard, and of his own fig tree: and you shall drink water of your own <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cisterns</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Till I come, and take you away, to a land, like to your own land, a fruitful land, and plentiful in wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olives, and oil, and honey, and you shall live, and not die. Hearken not to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, who deceiveth you, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will deliver us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land from the hand of the king of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Where is the god of Emath, and of Arphad? where is the god of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava? have they delivered <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> out of my hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Who are they among all the gods of the nations that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may deliver <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> out of my hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for they had received commandment from the king that they should not answer him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna, the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces.</span></p>
