<span class="poe003"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> I have cut down, and I have drunk strange waters, and have dried up with the soles of my feet all the shut up waters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Hast thou not heard what I have done from the beginning? from the days of old I have formed it, and now I have brought it to effect: that fenced cities of fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be turned to heaps of ruins: <span class="stiki"><strong>I have formed it, etc...</strong> All thy exploits, in which thou takest <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, are no more than what I have decreed; and are not to be ascribed to thy wisdom or strength, but to my will and ordinance: who have given to thee to take and destroy so many fenced cities, and to carry terror wherever thou comest. -- Ibid. <strong>Heaps of ruin...</strong> Literally ruin of the hills.</span></span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And to thee, O <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, this shall be a sign: Eat this year what thou shalt find: and in the second year, such things as spring of themselves: but in the third year sow and reap: plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And whatsoever shall be left of the house of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span><br />
