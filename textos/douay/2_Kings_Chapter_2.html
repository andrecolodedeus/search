<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he took up the mantle of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, that fell from him: and going back, he stood on the bank of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>;</span>

And he struck the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> passed over.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, at <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, who were over against him, seeing it, said: The spirit of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> hath rested upon <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>. And coming to meet him, they worshipped him, falling to the ground. <span class="stiki"><strong>They worshipped him...</strong> viz., with an inferior, yet religious <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a>, not for any temporal, but spiritual excellency.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they said to him: Behold, there are with thy servants, fifty strong <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that can go, and seek thy master, lest, perhaps, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a>, hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said: Do not send.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But they pressed him, till he consented, and said: Send. And they sent fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and they sought three days, but found him not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they came back to him: for he abode at <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and he said to them: Did I not say to you? Do not send.</span>
<p class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the city, said to <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>: Behold the situation of this city is very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as thou, my lord, seest: but the waters are very bad, and the ground barren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he said: Bring me a new vessel, and put <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> into it. And when they had brought it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> into it, and said: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more in them death or barrenness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, which he spoke.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he went up from thence to <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>: and as he was going up by the way, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying: Go up, thou bald head, go up, thou bald head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And looking back, he saw them, and <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> them in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of them, two and forty boys. <span class="stiki"><strong>Cursed them...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, which was followed by so visible a judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was not the effect of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>, or of a desire of revenging himself; but of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>, which was insulted by these boys, in the person of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; and of a <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">divine inspiration</a>: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punishing in this manner the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, (the chief seat of the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">calf</a> worship), who had trained up their children in a prejudice against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">true religion</a> and its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And from thence he went to <a href="../cathen/03352a.htm">mount Carmel</a>, and from thence he returned to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span></p>
