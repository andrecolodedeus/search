<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In those days <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> was sick unto death: and <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, the son of Amos, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, came and said to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Give charge concerning thy house, for thou shalt die, and not live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he turned his face to the wall, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> I beseech thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, remember how I have walked before thee in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is pleasing before thee. And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> wept with much weeping.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And before <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a> was gone out of the middle of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to him, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Go back, and tell <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of my people: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, thy father: I have heard thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and I have seen thy tears: and behold I have healed thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I will add to thy days fifteen years: and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and I will protect this city for my own sake, and for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, my servant's sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a> said: Bring me a lump of figs. And when they had brought it, and laid it upon his boil, he was healed.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a> said to him: This shall be the sign from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will do the word which he hath spoken: Wilt thou that the shadow go forward ten lines, or that it go back so many degrees?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> said: It is an easy matter for the shadow to go forward ten lines: and I do not desire that this be done, but let it return back ten degrees.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah, the prophet</a>, called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he brought the shadow ten degrees backwards by the lines, by which it had already gone down on the dial of <a href="../cathen/01101e.htm">Achaz</a>.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> rejoiced at their coming, and he showed them the house of his aromatical spices, and the gold, and the silver, and divers precious odours, and <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointments</a>, and the house of his vessels, and all that he had in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominions, that <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> showed them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah, the prophet</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">king Ezechias</a>, and said to him: What said these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? or from whence came they to thee? And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> said to him: From a far country, they came to me out of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said: What did they see in thy house? <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> said: They saw all the things that are in my house: There is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a> said to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>: Hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Behold the days shall come, that all that is in thy house, and that thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>: nothing shall be left, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And of thy sons also that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, they shall take away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>: The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which thou hast spoken, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: let peace and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be in my days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, and all his might, and how he made a <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a>, and a conduit, and brought waters into the city, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> slept with his fathers, and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
