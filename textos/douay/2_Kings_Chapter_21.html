<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, according to the idols of the nations, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed from before the face of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he turned, and built up the high places, which <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, his father, had destroyed: and he set up <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and made groves, as <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, had done: and he <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> all the host of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and served them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he built <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: In <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> I will put my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he made his son pass through fire: and he used divinations, and observed omens, and appointed pythons, and multiplied soothsayers, to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and to provoke him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Pythons...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirits</a>.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I will no more make the feet of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to be moved out of the land, which I gave to their fathers: only if they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, according to the law which my servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But they hearkened not: but were seduced by <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> more than the nations which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke in the hand of his servants, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Because <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, hath done these most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> abominations, beyond all that the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a> did before him, and hath made <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> also to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with his filthy doings:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold, I will bring on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: that whosoever shall hear of them, both his ears shall tingle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I will stretch over <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the line of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and the weight of the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>: and I will efface <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, as writings tables are wont to be effaced, and I will erase and turn it, and draw the pencil often over the face thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I will leave the remnants of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies: and they shall become a prey, and a spoil to all their enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Because they have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before me, and have continued to provoke me, from the day that their fathers came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, even unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Moreover, <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> shed also very much innocent blood, till he filled <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> up to the mouth: besides his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherewith he made <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now the rest of the acts of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and all that he did, and his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Oza: and Amon, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Two and twenty years old was Amon when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Messalemeth, the daughter of Harus, of Jeteba.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, his father, had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he walked in all the way in which his father had walked: and he served the abominations which his father had served, and he <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And forsook the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And his servants plotted against him, and slew the king in his own house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon: and made <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>, his son, their king in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But the rest of the acts of Amon, which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they buried him in his sepulchre, in the garden of Oza: and his son, <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
