<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king stood upon the step: and he made a covenant with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to walk after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, with all their heart, and with all their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to perform the words of this covenant, which were written in that book: and the people agreed to the covenant. <span class="stiki"><strong>The king stood upon the step...</strong> That is, his tribune, or tribunal, a more eminent place, from whence he might be seen and heard by the people.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He destroyed also the pavilions of the effeminate, which were in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, for which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> wove as it were little dwellings for the grove.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he gathered together all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> out of the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and he defiled the high places, where the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, from Gabaa to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>: and he broke down the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Josue, governor of the city, which was on the left hand of the gate of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> However, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the high places came not up to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: but only eat of the <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened bread</a> among their brethren.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he took away the horses which the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> had given to the sun, at the entering in of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, near the chamber of Nathanmelech the eunuch, who was in Pharurim: and he burnt the chariots of the sun with fire.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he broke in pieces the statues, and cut down the groves: and he filled their places with the bones of dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> also that was at <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and the high place, which <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, who made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, had made: both the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and the high place, he broke down and burnt, and reduced to powder, and burnt the grove.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And as <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> turned himself, he saw there the sepulchres that were in the mount: and he sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burnt them upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and defiled it according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke, who had foretold these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said: What is that monument which I see?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said: Let him alone, let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> move his bones. So his bones were left untouched with the bones of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, that came out of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Moreover all the temples of the high places which were in the cities of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, which the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had made to provoke the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> took away: and he did to them according to all the acts that he had done in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he slew all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the high places, that were there, upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>; and he burnt <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> bones upon them: and returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he commanded all the people, saying: Keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Phase</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, according as it is written in the book of this covenant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now there was no such a <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Phase</a> kept from the days of the judges, who judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, nor in all the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> As was this <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Phase</a>, that was kept to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the eighteenth year of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">king Josias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Moreover the diviners by spirits, and soothsayers, and the figures of idols, and the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleannesses</a>, and the abominations, that had been in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> took away: that he might perform the words of the law, that were written in the book, which Helcias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> had found in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> There was no king before him like unto him, that returned to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with all his heart, and with all his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all his strength, according to all the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>: neither after him did there arise any like unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But yet the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> turned not away from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of his great indignation, wherewith his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> was kindled against <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: because of the provocations, wherewith <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> had provoked him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: I will remove <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> also from before my face, as I have removed <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and I will cast off this city <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which I chose, and the house, of which I said: My <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> shall be there.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> In his days <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> Nechao, king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, went up against the king of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a> to the river Euphrates: and king <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> went to meet him: and was slain at <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a>, when he had seen him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And his servants carried him dead from <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a>: and they brought him to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Joachaz, the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>: and they anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Amital, the daughter of <a href="../cathen/08333c.htm">Jeremiah, of Lobna</a>.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> Nechao made Eliacim, the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>, king in the room of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> his father: and turned his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> to Joakim.
