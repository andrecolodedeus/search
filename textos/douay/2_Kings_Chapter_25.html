<div class="h1a">Jerusalem is besieged and taken by Nebuchadnezzer: Sedecias is taken: the city and temple are destroyed. Godolias, who is left governor, is slain. Joachin is exalted by Evilmerodach.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon</a>, came, he and all his army, against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and they surrounded it: and raised works round about it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the city was shut up and besieged till the eleventh year of king Sedecias,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The ninth day of the month: and a famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And a breach was made into the city: and all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> fled in the night between the two walls by the king's garden (now the Chaldees besieged the city round about), and Sedecias fled by the way that leadeth to the plains of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>: and all the warriors that were with him were scattered, and left him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So they took the king, and brought him to the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, to Reblatha, and he gave judgment upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he slew the sons of Sedecias before his face, and he put out his eyes, and bound him with chains, and brought him to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> In the fifth month, the seventh day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, came Nabuzardan, commander of the army, a servant of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he burnt the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the king's house, and the houses of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and every great house he burnt with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And all the army of the Chaldees, which was with the commander of the troops, broke down the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Nabuzardan, the commander of the army, carried away the rest of the people, that remained in the city, and the fugitives, that had gone over to the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, and the remnant of the common people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> of the land he left some dressers of vines and husbandmen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the pillars of brass that were in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and the bases, and the sea of brass, which was in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, the Chaldees broke in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> They took away also the pots of brass, and the mazers, and the forks, and the cups, and the mortars, and all the vessels of brass, with which they ministered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Moreover also the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, and the bowls, such as were of gold in gold: and such as were of silver in silver, the general of the army took away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> That is, two pillars, one sea, and the bases which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had made in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> One pillar was eighteen cubits high: and the chapiter of brass, which was upon it, was three cubits high: and the network, and the pomegranates that were upon the chapiter of the pillar, were all of brass: and the second pillar had the like adorning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the general of the army took Seraias, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Sophonias, the second <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and three doorkeepers:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And out of the city one eunuch, who was <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> over the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and five <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of them who had stood before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher, the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the army, who exercised the young soldiers of the people of the land: and threescore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the common people, who were found in the city:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> These Nabuzardan, the general of the army, took away, and carried them to the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, to Reblatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> smote them, and slew them at Reblatha, in the land of Emath: so <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> was carried away out of their land.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But over the people that remained in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon</a>, had left, he gave the government to Godolias, the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam, the son of Saphan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the soldiers had heard this, they and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with them, to wit, that the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> had made Godolias governor they came to Godolias to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>, Ismael, the son of Nathanias, and Johanan, the son of Caree, and Saraia, the son of Thanehumeth, the Netophathite, and Jezonias, the son of Maachathi, they and their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Godolias <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to them and to their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, saying: Be not afraid to serve the Chaldees: stay in the land, and serve the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, and it shall be well with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismael, the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama, of the seed royal came, and ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him, and smote Godolias; so that he died: and also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the Chaldees that were with him in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And all the people, both little and great, and the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the soldiers, rising up, went to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, fearing the Chaldees.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Joachin, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, in the twelfth month, the seven and twentieth day of the month: Evilmerodach, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Joachin, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, out of prison.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he spoke kindly to him: and he set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he changed his garments which he had in prison, and he ate bread always before him, all the days of his life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he appointed him a continual allowance, which was also given him by the king, day by day, all the days of his life.</span></p>
