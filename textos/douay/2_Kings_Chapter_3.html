<div class="h1a">The kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom, fight against the king of Moab. They lack water, which Eliseus procures without rain: and prophesies victory. The king of Moab is overthrown, his city is besieged: he sacrifices his firstborn son: so the Israelites raise the siege.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Joram the son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, in the eighteenth year of Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>. And he reigned twelve years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but not like his father and his mother: for he took away the statues of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, which his father had made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Nevertheless, he stuck to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, who made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor did he depart from them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now <a href="../cathen/10210a.htm">Mesa</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, nourished many sheep, and he paid to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with their fleeces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> was dead, he broke the league which he had made with the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And king Joram went out that day from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and mustered all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he sent to Josaphat; king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saying: The king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is revolted from me: come with me against him to battle. And he answered: I will come up: he that is mine, is thine: my people are thy people: and my horses, thy horses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he said: Which way shall we go up? But he answered: By the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the king of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, went, and they fetched a compass of seven days journey, and there was no water for the army, and for the beasts, that followed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said: Alas, alas, alas, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath gathered us three kings together, to deliver us into the hands of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Josaphat said: Is there not here a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that we may beseech the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> by him? And one of the servants of the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> answered: Here is <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, the son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Josaphat said: The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> is with him. And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the king of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, went down to him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: What have I to do with thee? go to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of thy father, and thy mother. And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to him: Why hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gathered together these three kings, to deliver them into the hands of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said to him: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> liveth, in whose sight I stand, if I did not reverence the face of Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, I would not have hearkened to thee, nor looked on thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But now bring me hither a minstrel. And when the minstrel played, the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> came upon him, and he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Make the channel of this torrent full of ditches.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: You shall not see wind, nor rain: and yet this channel shall be filled with waters, and you shall drink, you and your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and your beasts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And this is a small thing in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: moreover, he will deliver, also, <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> into your hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And you shall destroy every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall cut down every fruitful tree, and shall stop up all the springs of waters, and every goodly field you shall cover with stones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And it came to pass, in the morning, when the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> used to be offered, that behold, water came by the way of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, and the country was filled with water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> hearing that the kings were come up to fight against them, gathered together all that were girded with a belt upon them, and stood in the borders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they rose early in the morning, and the sun being now up, and shining upon the waters, the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> saw the waters over against them red, like blood,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they said: It is the blood of the sword: the kings have fought among themselves, and they have killed one another: go now, <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, to the spoils.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they went into the camp of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> rising up, defeated <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, who fled before them. And they being conquerors, went and smote <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they destroyed the cities: And they filled every goodly field, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> casting his stone: and they stopt up all the springs of waters: and cut down all the trees that bore fruit, so that brick walls only remained: and the city was beset by the slingers, and a great part thereof destroyed. <span class="stiki"><strong>Brick walls only remained...</strong> It was the proper <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the capital city of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, Kir-Haraseth.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when the king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> saw this, to wit, that the enemies had prevailed, he took with him seven hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that drew the sword, to break in upon the king of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>: but they could not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Then he took his eldest son, that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> upon the wall: and there was great indignation in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and presently they departed from him, and returned into their own country.</span></p>
