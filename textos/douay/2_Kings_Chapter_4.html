<div class="h1a">Miracles of Eliseus. He raises a dead child to life.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the wives of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, cried to <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, saying: Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one that feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and behold the creditor is come to take away my two sons to serve him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said to her: What wilt thou have me do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in thy house? And she answered: I, thy handmaid, have nothing in my house but a little oil, to anoint me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said to her: Go, borrow of all thy neighbours empty vessels, not a few.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And go in, and shut thy door, when thou art within, and thy sons: and pour out thereof into all those vessels: and when they are full, take them away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> went, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons: they brought her the vessels, and she poured in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when the vessels were full, she said to her son: Bring me yet a vessel. And he answered: I have no more. And the oil stood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And she came, and told the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he said: Go, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor: and thou and thy sons live of the rest.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And there was a day when <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> passed by Sunam: now there was a great <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> there, who detained him to eat bread: and as he passed often that way, he turned into her house to eat bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And she said to her husband: I perceive that this is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who often passeth by us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Let us, therefore, make him a little chamber, and put a little bed in it for him, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, that when he cometh to us he may abide there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now, there was a certain day, when he came, and turned into the chamber, and rested there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said to Giezi, his servant: Call this Sunamitess. And when he had called her, and she stood before him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He said to his servant: Say to her: Behold, thou hast diligently served us in all things; what wilt thou have me to do for thee? Hast thou any business, and wilt thou, that I speak to the king, or to the general of the army? And she answered: I dwell in the midst of my own people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he said: What will she then that I do for her? And Giezi said: Do not ask, for she hath no son, and her husband is old.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then he bid him call her. And when she was called, and stood before the door,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He said to her: At this time, and this same hour, if life be in company, thou shalt have a son in thy womb. But she answered: Do not, I beseech thee, my lord, thou <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not lie to thy handmaid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> conceived, and brought forth a son in the time, and at the same hour that <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> had said.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the child grew. And on a certain day, when he went out to his father to the reapers,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He said to his father: My head acheth, my head acheth. But he said to his servant. Take him, and carry him to his mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, she sat him on her knees, until noon, and then he died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And she went up, and laid him upon the bed of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shut the door: and going out,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> She called her husband, and said: Send with me, I beseech thee, one of thy servants, and an ass, that I may run to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and come again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he said to her: Why dost thou go to him? to day is neither new moon nor <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>. She answered: I will go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And she saddled an ass, and commanded her servant: Drive, and make haste, make no stay in going: And do that which I bid thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> So she went forward, and came to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to <a href="../cathen/03352a.htm">mount Carmel</a>: and when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw her coming towards, he said to Giezi, his servant: Behold that Sunamitess.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Go, therefore, to meet her, and say to her: Is all well with thee, and with thy husband, and with thy son? And she answered: Well.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when she came to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the mount, she caught hold on his feet: and Giezi came to remove her. And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: Let her alone for her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in anguish, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And she said to him: Did I ask a son of my lord? did I not say to thee: Do not deceive me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then he said to Giezi: Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go. If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> meet thee, salute him not: and if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> salute thee, answer him not: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. <span class="stiki"><strong>Salute him not...</strong> He that is sent to raise to life the sinner spiritually dead, must not suffer himself to be called off, or diverted from his enterprise, by the salutations or <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of the world.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But the mother of the child said: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, and as thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> liveth, I will not leave thee. He arose, therefore, and followed her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But Giezi was gone before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, and there was no voice nor sense: and he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: The child is not risen. <span class="stiki"><strong></strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> considers a great mystery in this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> wrought by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, thus: By the staff sent by his servant is <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figured</a> the rod of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, which was not sufficient to bring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to life then dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It was necessary that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself should come, and by taking on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> nature, <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">become flesh of our flesh</a>, and restore us to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. In this <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as it was necessary that he should come himself to bring the dead child to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and restore him to his mother, who is here, in a mystical sense, a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, therefore, went into the house, and behold the child lay dead on his bed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And going in, he shut the door upon him, and upon the child, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he went up, and lay upon the child: and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he bowed himself upon him, and the child's flesh grew warm.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Then he returned and walked in the house, once to and fro: and he went up, and lay upon him: and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he called Giezi, and said to him: Call this Sunamitess. And she being called, went in to him: and he said: Take up thy son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> She came and fell at his feet, and worshipped upon the ground: and took up her son, and went out.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> returned to Galgal, and there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> dwelt before him: And he said to one of his servants: Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And one went out into the field to gather wild herbs: and he found something like a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds of the field, and filled his mantle, and coming back, he shred them into the pot of pottage; for he knew not what it was. <span class="stiki"><strong>Wild gourds of the field...</strong> Colocynthidas. They are extremely bitter, and therefore are called the gall of the earth; and are poisonous if taken in a great quantity.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they poured it out for their companions to eat: and when they had tasted of the pottage, they cried out, saying: Death is in the pot, O <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And they could not eat thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But he said: Bring some meal. And when they had brought it, he cast it into the pot, and said: Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was now no bitterness in the pot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> came from Baalsalisa, bringing to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bread of the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a>, twenty loaves of barley, and new corn in his scrip. And he said: Give to the people, that they may eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And his servant answered him: How much is this, that I should set it before a hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? He said again: Give to the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: They shall eat, and there shall be left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> So he set it before them: and they ate, and there was left, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span></p>
