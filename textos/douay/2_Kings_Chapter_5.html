<h1>2 Kings Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">Naaman the Syrian is cleansed of his leprosy. He professes his belief in one God, promising to serve him. Giezi takes gifts of Naaman, and is struck with leprosy.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Naaman, general of the army, of the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, was a great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his master, and honourable: for by him the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave deliverance to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>: and he was a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and rich, but a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now there had gone out robbers from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and had led away captive out of the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, a little maid, and she waited upon Naaman's wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And she said to her mistress: I wish my master had been with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: he would certainly have healed him of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> which he hath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then Naaman went in to his lord, and told him, saying: Thus and thus said the girl from the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> said to him: Go; and I will send a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And brought the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in these words: When thou shalt receive this <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>, know that I have sent to thee Naaman, my servant, that thou mayst heal him of his <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had read the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>, he rent his garments, and said: Am I <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be able to kill and give life, that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath sent to me to heal a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of his <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>? mark, and see how he seeketh occasions against me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had heard this, to wit, that the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had rent his garments, he sent to him, saying: Why hast thou rent thy garments? let him come to me, and let him know that there is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and stood at the door of the house of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> sent a messenger to him, saying: Go, and wash seven times in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and thy flesh shall recover health, and thou shalt be clean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Naaman was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and went away, saying: I thought he would have come out to me, and standing, would have invoked the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and touched with his hand the place of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, and healed me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Are not the Abana, and the Pharphar, rivers of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, better than all the waters of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that I may wash in them, and be made clean? So as he turned, and was going away with indignation,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> His servants came to him, and said to him: Father, if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had bid thee do some great thing, surely thou shouldst have done it: how much rather what he now hath said to thee: Wash, and thou shalt be clean?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then he went down, and washed in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> seven times, according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child: and he was made clean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And returning to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with all his train, he came, and stood before him, and said: In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I know there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in all the earth, but only in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: I beseech thee, therefore, take a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of thy servant. <span class="stiki"><strong>A blessing...</strong> a present.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But he answered: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And when he pressed him, he still refused.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Naaman said: As thou wilt: but I beseech thee, grant to me, thy servant, to take from hence two mules' burden of earth: for thy servant will not henceforth offer <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, or victim, to other gods, but to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But there is only this, for which thou shalt entreat the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for thy servant; when my master goeth into the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Remmon, to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand: if I bow down in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Remmon, when he boweth down in the same place, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> pardon me, thy servant, for this thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he said to him: Go in peace. So he departed from him, in the spring time of the earth. <span class="stiki"><strong>Go in peace...</strong> What the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> here allowed, was not an outward conformity to an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous worship</a>; but only a service which by his office he owed to his master: who on all public occasions leaned on him: so that his bowing down when his master bowed himself down was not in effect <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoring</a> the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: nor was it so understood by the standers by, since he publicly professed himself a <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipper</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, but it was no more than doing a civil office to the king his master, whose leaning upon him <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to bow at the same time that he bowed.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But Giezi, the servant of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, said: My master hath spared Naaman this <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, in not receiving of him that which he brought: as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, I will run after him, and take something of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Giezi followed after Naaman: and when he saw him running after him, he leapt down from his chariot to meet him, and said: Is all well?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said: Well: my master hath sent me to thee, saying: Just now there are come to me from mount Ephraim, two young men of the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: give them a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Naaman said: It is better that thou take two talents. And he forced him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants, and they carried them before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when he was come, and now it was the evening, he took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and sent the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> away, and they departed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But he went in, and stood before his master. And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said: Whence comest thou, Giezi? He answered: Thy servant went no whither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But he said: Was not my heart present, when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turned back, from his chariot, to meet thee? So now thou hast received money, and received garments, to buy oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>-servants, and maid-servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of Naaman, shall also stick to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from him a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, as white as snow.</span></p>
