<div class="h1a">Eliseus makes iron to swim upon the water: he leads the Syrians that were sent to apprehend him into Samaria, where there eyes being opened, they are courteously entertained.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> said to <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>: Behold, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Let us go as far as the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and take out of the wood every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a piece of timber, that we may build us there a place to dwell in. And he said: Go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And one of them said: But come thou also with thy servants. He answered: I will come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So he went with them. And when they were come to the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, they cut down wood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And it happened, as one was felling some timber, that the head of the ax fell into the water: and he cried out, and said: Alas, alas, alas, my lord, for this same was borrowed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: Where did it fall? and he showed him the place: Then he cut off a piece of wood, and cast it in thither: and the iron swam.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said: Take it up. And he put out his hand, and took it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> warred against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and took counsel with his servants, saying: In such and such a place, let us lay an ambush.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: Beware that thou pass not to such a place: for the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> are there in ambush.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, sent to the place which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had told him, and prevented him, and looked well to himself there not once nor twice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the heart of the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, was troubled for this thing. And calling together his servants, he said: Why do you not tell me who it is that betrays me to the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And one of his servants said: No one, my lord, O king: but <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, that is in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, telleth the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> all the words, that thou speakest in thy privy chamber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he said to them: Go, and see where he is: that I may send and take him. And they told him: saying: Behold he is in Dothan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Therefore, he sent thither horses, and chariots, and the strength of an army: and they came by night, and beset the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the servant of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rising early went out, and saw an army round about the city, and horses and chariots: and he told him, saying: Alas, alas, alas, my lord, what shall we do?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But he answered: Fear not: for there are more with us than with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, open his eyes, that he may see. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses, and chariots of fire round about <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the enemies came down to him: but <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: Strike, I beseech thee, this people with blindness: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> struck them with blindness, according to the word of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Blindness...</strong> The blindness here spoken of was of a particular kind, which hindered them from seeing the objects that were really before them; and represented other different objects to their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>: so that they no longer perceived the city of Dothan, nor were able to know the person of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>; but were easily led by him, whom they took to be another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. So that he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> told them, this is not the way, neither is this the city, etc., because he spoke with relation to the way and to the city, which was represented to them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said to them: This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will show you the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom you seek. So he led them into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when they were come into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, open the eyes of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they may see. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> opened their eyes, and they saw themselves to be in the midst of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, when he saw them: My father, shall I kill them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said: Thou shalt not kill them: for thou didst not take them with thy sword, or thy bow, that thou mayst kill them: but set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And a great provision of meats was set before them, and they ate and drank; and he let them go: and they went away to their master: and the robbers of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> came no more into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And it came to pass, after these things, that Benadad, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, gathered together all his army, and went up and besieged <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And there was a great famine in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: and so long did the siege continue, till the head of an ass was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cabe of pigeons' dung, for five pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And as the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was passing by the wall, a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cried out to him, saying: Save me, my lord, O king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he said: If the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> doth not save thee, how can I save thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress? And the king said to her: What aileth thee? And she answered:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to me: Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day: Give thy son, that we may eat him. And she hath hid her son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> When the king heard this, he rent his garments, and passed by upon the wall. And all the people saw the haircloth which he wore within next to his flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the king said: May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do so and so to me, and may he add more, if the head of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a>, the son of Saphat, shall stand on him this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> sat in his house, and the ancients sat with him. So he sent a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before: and before that messenger came, he said to the ancients: Do you know that this son of a murderer hath sent to cut off my head? Look then when the messenger shall come, shut the door, and suffer him not to come in: for behold the sound of his master's feet is behind him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> While he was yet speaking to them, the messenger appeared, who was coming to him. And he said: Behold, so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: what shall I look for more from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span></p>
