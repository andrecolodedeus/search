<h1>2 Kings Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">Eliseus prophesies a great plenty, which presently ensues upon the sudden flight of the Syrians; of which four lepers bring the news to the city. The incredulous nobleman is trod to death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said: Hear ye the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Tomorrow, about this time, a bushel of fine flour shall be sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, in the gate of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>A stater...</strong> It is the same as a sicle or shekel.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then one of the lords, upon whose hand the king leaned, answering the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, said: If the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> should make flood-gates in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, can that possibly be which thou sayest? And he said: Thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now there were four <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another: What mean we to stay here till we die?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine: and if we will remain here, we must also die: come therefore, and let us run over to the camp of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>. If they spare us, we shall live: but if they kill us, we shall but die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So they arose in the evening, to go to the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> camp. And when they were come to the first part of the camp of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, they found no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had made them hear, in the camp of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the noise of chariots, and of horses, and of a very great army: and they said one to another: Behold, the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath hired against us the kings of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethites</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>; and they are come upon us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their tents, and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled, desiring to save their lives.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So when these <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> were come to the beginning of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank: and they took from thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it: and they came again, and went into another tent, and carried from thence in like manner, and hid it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then they said one to another: We do not well: for this is a day of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tidings. If we hold our peace, and do not tell it till the morning, we shall be charged with a crime: come, let us go, and tell it in the king's <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So they came to the gate of the city, and told them, saying: We went to the camp of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, and we found no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there, but horses, and asses tied, and the tents standing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then the guards of the gate went, and told it within in the king's palace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he arose in the night, and said to his servants: I tell you what the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> have done to us: They know that we suffer great famine, and therefore they are gone out of the camp, and lie hid in the fields, saying: When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and then we may get into the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And one of his servants answered: Let us take the five horses that are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole multitude of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for the rest are consumed), and let us send and see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the camp of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, saying: Go, and see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they went after them, as far as the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: and behold, all the way was full of garments, and vessels, which the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> had cast away, in their fright, and the messengers returned, and told the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the people going out, pillaged the camp of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>: and a bushel of fine flour was sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned, to stand at the gate: and the people trod upon him in the entrance of the gate; and he died, as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had said, when the king came down to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And it came to pass, according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he spoke to the king, when he said: Two bushels of barley shall be for a stater, and a bushel of fine flour for a stater, at this very time tomorrow, in the gate of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> When that lord answered the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: Although the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> should make flood-gates in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, could this come to pass which thou sayest? And he said to him: Thou shalt see it with thy eyes, and shalt not eat thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And so it fell out to him, as it was foretold, and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.</span></p>
