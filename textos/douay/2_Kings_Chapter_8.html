<h1>2 Kings Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="h1a">After seven years' famine foretold by Eliseus, the Sunamitess returning home, recovers her lands, and revenues. Eliseus foreshows the death of Benadad, king of Syria, and the reign of Hazael. Joram's wicked reign in Judah. He dies, and his son Ochozias succeeds.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> spoke to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whose son he had restored to life, saying: Arise, and go thou, and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst find: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath called a famine, and it shall come upon the land seven years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And she arose, and did according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> many days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when the seven years were ended, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> returned out of the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and she went forth to speak to the king for her house and for her lands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king talked with Giezi, the servant of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: Tell me all the great things that <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> hath done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when he was telling the king how he had raised one dead to life, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> appeared, whose son he had restored to life, crying to the king for her house, and her lands. And Giezi said: My lord, O king, this is the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and this is her son, whom <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> raised to life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the king asked the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: and she told him. And the king appointed her an eunuch, saying: Restore her all that is hers, and all the revenues of the lands, from the day that she left the land to this present.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> also came to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and Benadad, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> was sick; and they told him, saying: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is come hither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the king said to Hazael: Take with thee presents, and go to meet the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and consult the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> by him, saying: Can I recover of this my illness?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Hazael went to meet him, taking with him presents, and all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, the burdens of forty camels. And when he stood before him, he said: Thy son, Benadad, the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, hath sent me to thee, saying: Can I recover of this my illness?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said to him: Go tell him: Thou shalt recover: but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath showed me that he shall surely die. <span class="stiki"><strong>Tell him: thou shalt recover...</strong> By these words the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> signified that the king's disease was not mortal: and that he would recover if no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> were used. Or he might only express himself in this manner, by way of giving Hazael to understand that he knew both what he would say and do; that he would indeed tell the king he should recover; but would be himself the instrument of his death.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he stood with him, and was troubled so far as to blush: and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Hazael said to him: Why doth my lord weep? And he said: Because I know the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that thou wilt do to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>. Their strong cities thou wilt burn with fire, and their young men thou wilt kill with the sword, and thou wilt dash their children, and rip up their pregnant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Hazael said: But what am I, thy servant, a dog, that I should do this great thing? And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath showed me that thou shalt be king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when he was departed from <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> he came to his master, who said to him: What said <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> to thee? And he answered: He told me: Thou shalt recover.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And on the next day, he took a blanket, and poured water on it, and spread it upon his face: and he died, and Hazael reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> In the fifth year of Joram, son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and of Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, reigned Joram, son of Josaphat, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>And of Josaphat, etc...</strong> That is, Josaphat being yet alive, who sometime before his death made his son Joram king, as <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had done before by his own son <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He was two and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he walked in the ways of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> had walked: for the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> was his wife: and he did that which was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> would not destroy <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> his servant's sake, as he had <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> him, to give him a light, and to his children always.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> In his days <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> revolted from being under <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and made themselves a king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Joram came to Seira, and all the chariots with him: and he arose in the night, and defeated the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a> that had surrounded him, and the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the chariots, but the people fled into their tents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> revolted from being under <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, unto this day. Then Lobna also revolted at the same time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and Ochozias, his son, reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> In the twelfth year of Joram, the son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, reigned Ochozias, son of Joram, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Ochozias was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Daughter...</strong> That is, grand-daughter; for she was daughter of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a> son of Amri, <a href="../douay/2ki008.htm#verse29">verse 18</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he walked in the ways of the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>: and he did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as did the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>: for he was the son in law of the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> He went also with Joram, son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, to fight against Hazael, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, in Ramoth Galaad, and the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> wounded Joram:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he went back to be healed, in Jezrahel: because the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> had wounded him in Ramoth, when he fought against Hazael, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> And Ochozias, the son of Joram, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, went down to visit Joram, the son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, in Jezrahel, because he was sick there.</span></p>
