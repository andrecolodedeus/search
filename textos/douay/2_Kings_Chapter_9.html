<div class="h1a">Jehu is anointed king of Israel, to destroy the house of Achab and Jezebel. He kills Joram king of Israel, and Ochozias king of Judah. Jezebel is eaten by dogs.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus the prophet</a>, called one of the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and said to him: Gird up thy loins, and take this little bottle of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when thou art come thither, thou shalt see <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> the son of Josaphat the son of Namsi: and going in, thou shalt make him rise up from amongst his brethren, and carry him into an inner chamber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then taking the little bottle of oil, thou shalt pour it on his head, and shalt say: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: I have anointed thee king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And thou shalt open the door and flee, and shalt not stay there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So the young man, the servant of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, went away to Ramoth Galaad,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And went in thither: and behold, the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army were sitting, and he said: I have a word to thee, O prince. And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> said: Unto whom of us all? And he said: To thee, O prince.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he arose, and went into the chamber: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: I have anointed thee king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And thou shalt cut off the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, thy master, and I will revenge the blood of my servants, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the blood of all the servants of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, at the hand of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I will destroy all the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, and I will cut off from <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the meanest in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I will make the house of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, like the house of <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the son of Nabat, and like the house of Baasa, the son of Ahias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the dogs shall eat <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, in the field of Jezrahel, and there shall be no one to bury her. And he opened the door and fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> went forth to the servants of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and they said to him: Are all things well? why came this madman to thee? And he said to them: You know the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and what he said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But they answered: It is false; but rather do thou tell us. And he said to them: Thus and thus did he speak to me: and he said: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: I have anointed thee king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then they made haste, and taking every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his garment, laid it under his feet, after the manner of a judgment seat, and they sounded the trumpet, and said: <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> is king.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, the son of Josaphat, the son of Namsi, conspired against Joram. Now Joram had besieged Ramoth Galaad, he, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, fighting with Hazael, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And was returned to be healed in Jezrahel of his wounds; for the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> had wounded him, when he fought with Hazael, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> said: If it please you, let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> go forth or flee out of the city, lest he go, and tell in Jezrahel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he got up, and went into Jezrahel for Joram was sick there, and Ochozias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, was come down to visit Joram.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The watchman therefore, that stood upon the tower of Jezrahel, saw the troop of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> coming, and said: I see a troop. And Joram said: Take a chariot, and send to meet them, and let him that goeth say: Is all well?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> So there went one in a chariot to meet him, and said: Thus saith the king: Are all things peaceable? And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> said: What hast thou to do with peace? go behind and follow me. And the watchman told, saying: The messenger came to them, but he returneth not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he sent a second chariot of horses: and he came to them, and said: Thus saith the king: Is there peace? And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> said: What hast thou to do with peace? pass, and follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the watchman told, saying: He came even to them, but returneth not: and the driving is like the driving of <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, the son of Namsi; for he drives furiously.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Joram said: Make ready the chariot. And they made ready his chariot: and Joram, king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Ochozias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, and met him in the field of Naboth, the Jezrahelite.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when Joram saw <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>, he said: Is there peace, <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a>? And he answered: What peace? so long as the fornications of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, thy mother, and her many sorceries, are in their vigour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Joram turned his hand, and fleeing, said to Ochozias: There is treachery, Ochozias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> bent his bow with his hand, and shot Joram between the shoulders: and the arrow went out through his heart, and immediately he fell in his chariot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> said to Badacer, his <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>: Take him, and cast him into the field of Naboth, the Jezrahelite: for I remember, when I and thou, sitting in a chariot, followed <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> father, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> laid this burden upon him, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> If I do not requite thee in this field, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for the blood of Naboth, and for the blood of his children, which I saw yesterday, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. So now take him, and cast him into the field, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But Ochozias, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, seeing this, fled by the way of the garden house: and <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> pursued him, and said: Strike him also in his chariot. And they struck him in the going up to Gaver, which is by Jeblaam: and he fled into <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a>, and died there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And his servants laid him upon his chariot, and carried him to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and they buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers, in the city of David.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of <a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">Achab</a>, Ochozias reigned over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> came into Jezrahel. But <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, hearing of his coming in, painted her face with stibic stone, and adorned her head, and looked out of a window.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> At <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> coming in at the gate, and said: Can there be peace for Zambri, that hath killed his master?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> lifted up his face to the window, and said: Who is this? And two or three eunuchs bowed down to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he said to them: Throw her down headlong; And they threw her down, and the wall was sprinkled with her blood, and the hoofs of the horses trod upon her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And when he was come in to eat, and to drink, he said: Go, and see after that <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and bury her; because she is a king's daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when they went to bury her, they found nothing but the skull, and the feet, and the extremities of her hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And coming back they told him. And <a href="../cathen/08332a.htm">Jehu</a> said: It is the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which he spoke by his servant <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, the Thesbite, saying: In the field of Jezrahel the dogs shall eat the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> shall be as dung upon the face of the earth in the field of Jezrahel; so that they who pass by shall say: Is this that same <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>?</span></p>
