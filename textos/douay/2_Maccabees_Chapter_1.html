<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be gracious to you, and remember his covenant that he made with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, his faithful servants:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And give you all a heart to worship him, and to do his will with a great heart, and a willing <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> May he open your heart in his law, and in his commandments, and send you peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> May he hear your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and be reconciled unto you, and never forsake you in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And now here we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> When Demetrius reigned, in the year one hundred and sixty-nine, we <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> wrote to you in the trouble and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> that came upon us in those years, after <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> withdrew himself from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land, and from the kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They burnt the gate, and shed innocent blood: then we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and were heard, and we offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and fine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And now celebrate ye the days of Scenopegia in the month of Casleu. <span class="stiki"><strong>Scenopegia...</strong> Viz., the <em>Encenia</em>, or feast of the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, called here <em>Scenopegia</em>, or <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">feast of tabernacles</a>, from being celebrated with the like <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> In the year one hundred and eighty-eight, the people that is at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and the senate, and Judas, to Aristobolus, the preceptor of king Ptolemee, who is of the stock of the anointed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that are in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, health and welfare.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Having been delivered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> out of great dangers, we give him great thanks, forasmuch as we have been in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with such a king. <span class="stiki"><strong>Such a king...</strong> Viz., Antiochus Sidetes, who began to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whilst Simon was yet alive. <a href="../douay/1ma015.htm#verse39">1 Maccabees 15:39</a>. And afterwards besieged <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> under John Hircanus. So that the Judas here mentioned, <a href="../douay/2ma001.htm#verse10">verse 10</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>, who was dead long before the year 188 of the kingdom of the Greeks, for he died in the year 146 of that epoch, (see above <a href="../douay/1ma002.htm#verse70">1 Maccabees 2:70</a>, also the note on <a href="../douay/1ma001.htm#verse2">1:2</a>), but either Judas the eldest son of John Hircanus, or Judas the Essene, renowned for the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a>, who flourished about that time.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For he made numbers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> swarm out of Persia, that have fought against us, and the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For when the leader himself was in Persia, and with him a very great army, he fell in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Nanea, being deceived by the counsel of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Nanea. <span class="stiki"><strong>Nanea...</strong> A <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> goddess, which some have taken for Diana, others for Venus.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For Antiochus, with his friends, came to the place as though he would <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> her, and that he might receive great sums of money under the title of a dowry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Nanea had set it forth, and he with a small company had entered into the compass of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, they shut the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> When Antiochus was come in: and opening a secret entrance of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, they cast stones and slew the leader, and them that were with him, and hewed them in pieces; and cutting off their heads, they threw them forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all things, who hath delivered up the wicked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore, whereas we purpose to keep the purification of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> on the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu, we thought it necessary to signify it to you: that you also may keep the day of Scenopegia, and the day of the fire, that was given when Nehemias offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> was built.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For when our fathers were led into Persia, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that then were worshippers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, took privately the fire from the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and hid it in a valley where there was a deep pit without water, and there they kept it safe, so that the place was unknown to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Persia...</strong> <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, called here <em><a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a></em>, from being afterwards a part of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian empire</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But when many years had passed, and it pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that Nehemias should be sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that had hid it, to seek for the fire: and as they told us, they found no fire, but thick water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then he bade them draw it up, and bring it to him: and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Nehemias, commanded the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> that were laid on, to be sprinkled with the same water, both the wood, and the things that were laid upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when this was done, and the time came that the sun shone out, which before was in a cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that all wondered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> made <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was consuming, <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> beginning, and the rest answering.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Nehemias was after this manner: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, Creator of all things, dreadful and strong, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and merciful, who alone art the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Who alone art gracious, who alone art <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and almighty, and eternal, who deliverest <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who didst choose the fathers, and didst sanctify them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Receive the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for all thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and preserve thy own portion, and sanctify it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Gather together our <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered people</a>, deliver them that are slaves to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and look upon them that are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> and abhorred: that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> may know that thou art our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Punish them that oppress us, and that treat us injuriously with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Establish thy people in thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> hath spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sung hymns till the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was consumed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was consumed, Nehemias commanded the water that was left to be poured out upon the great stones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Which being done, there was kindled a flame from them: but it was consumed by the light that shined from the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And when this matter became public, it was told to the king of Persia, that in the place where the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that were led away, had hid the fire, there appeared water, with which Nehemias and they that were with him had purified the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the king considering, and diligently examining the matter, made a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> for it, that he might prove what had happened. <span class="stiki"><strong>A temple...</strong> That is, an enclosure, or a wall round about the place where the fire was hid, to separate it from profane uses, to the end that it might be respected as a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when he had proved it, he gave the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> many goods, and divers presents, and he took and distributed them to them with his own hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And Nehemias called this place Nephthar, which is interpreted purification. But many call it Nephi.</span></p>
