<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 10</h1>
<div class="h1a">The purification of the temple and city. Other exploits of Judas. His victory over Timotheus.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, and they that were with him, by the protection of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, recovered the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and the city again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But he threw down the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> had set up in the streets, as also the temples of the idols.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And having purified the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, they made another <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: and taking fire out of the fiery stones, they offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> after two years, and set forth <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and lamps, and the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">loaves of proposition</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they had done these things, they besought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, lying prostrate on the ground, that they might no more fall into such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; but if they should at any time <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that they might be chastised by him more gently, and not be delivered up to barbarians and blasphemous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now upon the same day that the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> had been polluted by the strangers on the very same day it was cleansed again; to wit, on the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they kept eight days with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, after the manner of the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not long before they had kept the feast of the tabernacles when they were in the mountains, and in dens like wild beasts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Therefore they now carried boughs and green branches and palms, for Him that had given them good success in cleansing His place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they ordained by a common statute, and decree, that all the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> should keep those days every year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And this was the end of Antiochus, that was called the Illustrious.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But now we will repeat the acts of Eupator, the son of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Antiochus, abridging the account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that happened in the wars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For when he was come to the crown, he appointed over the affairs of his realm one Lysias, general of the army of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phenicia</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For Ptolemee, that was called Macer, was determined to be strictly <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and especially by reason of the wrong that had been done them, and to deal peaceably with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But being accused for this to Eupator by his friends, and being oftentimes called traitor, because he had left <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, which Philometor had committed to him, and coming over to Antiochus the Illustrious, had revolted also from him, he put an end to his life by poison.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But Gorgias, who was governor of the holds, taking with him the strangers, often fought against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that occupied the most commodious holds, received those that were driven out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and attempted to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Jews, etc...</strong> He speaks of them that had fallen from their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>, and were enemies of their country, who joining with the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumeans</a> or <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a>, kept possession of the strong holds, and from thence annoyed their countrymen.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then they that were with <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, beseeching the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be their helper, made a strong attack upon the strong holds of the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumeans</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And assaulting them with great force, won the holds, killed them that came in the way, and slew altogether no fewer than twenty thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And whereas some were fled into very strong towers, having all manner of provision to sustain a siege,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> left Simon and Joseph, and Zacheus, and them that were with them, in sufficient number to besiege them, and departed to those expeditions which urged more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now they that were with Simon, being led with <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, were persuaded for the sake of money by some that were in the towers: and taking seventy thousand didrachmas, let some of them escape.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But when it was told <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> what was done, he assembled the rulers of the people, and accused those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that they had sold their brethren for money, having let their adversaries escape.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So he put these traitors to death, and forthwith took the two towers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And having good success in arms, and all things he took in hand, he slew more than twenty thousand in the two holds.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But Timotheus, who before had been overcome by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, having called together a multitude of foreign troops, and assembled horsemen out of Asia, came as though he would take <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> by force of arms.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, and they that were with him, when he drew near, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, sprinkling earth upon their heads, and girding their loins with haircloth,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And lying prostrate at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, besought him to be merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law saith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And so after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> taking their arms, they went forth further from the city, and when they were come very near the enemies they rested.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But as soon as the sun was risen both sides joined battle: the one part having, with their valour, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for a surety of victory, and success: but the other side making their rage their leader in battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But when they were in the heat of the engagement, there appeared to the enemies from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> five <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> upon horses, comely, with golden bridles, conducting the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Two of them took <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> between them, and covered him on every side with their arms, and kept him safe; but cast darts and fireballs against the enemy, so that they fell down, being both confounded with blindness, and filled with trouble.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And there were slain twenty thousand five hundred, and six hundred horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But Timotheus fled into Gazara, a strong hold where Chereas was governor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, and they that were with him cheerfully laid siege to the fortress four days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But they that were within, trusting to the strength of the place, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> exceedingly, and cast forth abominable words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But when the fifth day appeared, twenty young men of them that were with <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, inflamed in their minds, because of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, approached manfully to the wall, and pushing forward with fierce <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, got up upon it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Moreover, others also getting up after them, went to set fire to the towers and the gates, and to burn the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And having for two days together pillaged and sacked the fortress, they killed Timotheus, who was found hid in a certain place: they slew also his brother Chereas, and Apollophanes. <span class="stiki"><strong>Timotheus...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who was killed at the taking of Gazara, is different from that Timotheus who is mentioned in <a href="../douay/1ma005.htm">1 Maccabees 5</a>, and of whom there is mention in the <a href="../douay/2ma011.htm">following chapter</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And when this was done, they <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with hymns and thanksgiving, who had done great things in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and given them the victory.</span></p>
