<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">Lysias is overthrown by Judas. He sues for peace.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> A short time after this Lysias, the king's lieutenant, and cousin, and who had chief charge over all the affairs, being greatly displeased with what had happened,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Gathered together fourscore thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and all the horsemen, and came against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, thinking to take the city, and make it a habitation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And to make a gain of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, as of the other temples of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and to set the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> to sale every year:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Never considering the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but puffed up in mind, and trusting in the multitude of his foot soldiers, and the thousands of his horsemen, and his fourscore elephants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So he came into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and approaching to Bethsura, which was in a narrow place, the space of five furlongs from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he laid siege to that fortress.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But when <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, and they that were with him, understood that the strong holds were besieged, they and all the people besought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with lamentations and tears, that he would send a <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">good angel</a> to save <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> himself first taking his arms, exhorted the rest to expose themselves together with him, to the danger, and to succour their brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when they were going forth together with a willing mind, there appeared at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a horseman going before them in white clothing, with golden armour, shaking a spear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then they all together <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and took great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>: being ready to break through not only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also the fiercest beasts, and walls of iron.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So they went on <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a>, having a helper from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who showed mercy to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And rushing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> upon the enemy, like lions, they slew of them eleven thousand footmen, and one thousand six hundred horsemen:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And put all the rest to flight; and many of them being wounded, escaped naked: Yea, and Lysias himself fled away shamefully, and escaped.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And as he was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of understanding, considering with himself the loss he had suffered, and perceiving that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a> could not be overcome, because they relied upon the help of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, he sent to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And promised that he would agree to all things that are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and that he would persuade the king to be their friend.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> consented to the request of Lysias, providing for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in all things; and whatsoever <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> wrote to Lysias, concerning the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the king allowed of.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For there were <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> written to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from Lysias, to this effect: Lysias, to the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> John, and Abesalom, who were sent from you, delivering your writings, requested that I would accomplish those things which were signified by them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore whatsoever things could be reported to the king, I have represented to him: and he hath granted as much as the matter permitted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> If, therefore, you will keep yourselves loyal in affairs, hereafter also I will endeavour to be a means of your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But as concerning other particulars, I have given orders by word both to these, and to them that are sent by me, to commune with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Fare ye well. In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the four and twentieth day of the month of Dioscorus. <span class="stiki"><strong>In the year 148...</strong> Viz., according to the computation followed by the Greeks; which was different from that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, followed by the writer of the <a href="../douay/1ma000.htm">first book of Machabees</a>. However, by this date, as well as by other circumstances, it appears that the expedition of Lysias, mentioned in this chapter, is different from that which is recorded, <a href="../douay/1ma006.htm">1 Maccabees 6</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But the king's <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> contained these words King Antiochus to Lysias, his brother, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Our father being translated amongst the gods we are desirous that they that are in our realm should live quietly, and apply themselves diligently to their own concerns.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And we have heard that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would not consent to my father to turn to the rites of the Greeks but that they would keep to their own manner of living and therefore that they request us to allow them to live after their own laws.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Wherefore being desirous that this nation also should be at rest, we have ordained and decreed, that the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> should be restored to them, and that they may live according to the custom of their ancestors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Thou shalt do well, therefore, to send to them, and grant them peace, that our pleasure being known, they may be of good comfort, and look to their own affairs.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But the king's <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was in this manner: King Antiochus to the senate of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> If you are well, you are as we desire: we ourselves also are well.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Menelaus came to us, saying that you desired to come down to your countrymen, that are with us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> We grant, therefore, a safe conduct to all that come and go, until the thirtieth day of the month of Xanthicus,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> That the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> may use their own kind of meats, and their own laws, as before: and that none of them any manner of ways be molested for things which have been done by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And we have sent also Menelaus to speak to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Fare ye well. In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> The Romans also sent them a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>, to this effect: Quintus Memmius, and Titus Manilius, ambassadors of the Romans, to the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Whatsoever Lysias, the king's cousin, hath granted to you, we also have granted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But touching such things as he thought should be referred to the king, after you have diligently conferred among yourselves, send some one forthwith, that we may decree as it is convenient for you: for we are going to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And therefore make haste to write back, that we may know of what mind you are.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Fare ye well. In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus.</span></p>
