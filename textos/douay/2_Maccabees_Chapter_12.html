<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Jews are still molested by their neighbours. Judas gains various victories over them. He orders sacrifice and prayers for the dead.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> When these covenants were made, Lysias went to the king, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gave themselves to husbandry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But they that were behind, viz. Timotheus, and Apollonius, the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, and besides them Nicanor, the governor of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, would not suffer them to live in peace, and to be quiet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> also were guilty of this kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: they desired the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who dwelt among them, to go with their wives and children into the boats, which they had prepared, as though they had no enmity to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Which when they had consented to, according to the common decree of the city, suspecting nothing, because of the peace: when they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no fewer than two hundred of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But as soon as <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> heard of this cruelty done to his countrymen, he commanded the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him: and after having called upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> judge,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He came against those murderers of his brethren, and set the haven on fire in the night, burnt the boats, and slew with the sword them that escaped from the fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when he had done these things in this manner, he departed as if he would return again, and root out all the Joppites.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But when he understood that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jamnia also designed to do in like manner to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that dwelt among them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set the haven on fire, with the ships, so that the light of the fire was seen at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, two hundred and forty furlongs off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when they were now gone from thence nine furlongs, and were marching towards Timotheus, five thousand footmen, and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians, set upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And after a hard fight, in which, by the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they got the victory, the rest of the Arabians being overcome, besought <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> for peace, promising to give him pastures, and to assist him in other things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> thinking that they might be profitable indeed in many things, promised them peace, and after having joined hands, they departed to their tents.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He also laid siege to a certain strong city, encompassed with bridges and walls, and inhabited by multitudes of different nations, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of which is Casphin.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But they that were within it, trusting in the strength of the walls, and the provision of victuals, behaved in a more negligent manner, and provoked <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> with <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">railing</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a>, and uttering such words as were not to be spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> calling upon the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of the world, who without any rams or engines of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> threw down the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, in the time of <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, fiercely assaulted the walls. <span class="stiki"><strong>Rams...</strong> That is, engines for battering walls, etc., which were used in sieges in those times.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And having taken the city by the will of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he made an unspeakable slaughter, so that a <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a> adjoining, of two furlongs broad, seemed to run with the blood of the slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> From thence they departed seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that are called Tubianites.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But as for Timotheus, they found him not in those places, for before he had dispatched any thing he went back, having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But Dositheus, and Sosipater, who were <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> with <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, slew them that were left by Timotheus in the hold, to the number of ten thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> having set in order about him six thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and divided them by bands, went forth against Timotheus, who had with him a hundred and twenty thousand footmen, and two thousand five hundred horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now when Timotheus had knowledge of the coming of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, he sent the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, and the other baggage, before him into a fortress, called Carnion: for it was impregnable, and hard to come at, by reason of the straitness of the places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But when the first band of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> came in sight, the enemies were struck with fear, by the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who seeth all things, and they were put to flight one from another, so that they were often thrown down by their own companions, and wounded with the strokes of their own swords.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> pursued them close, punishing the profane, of whom he slew thirty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Timotheus himself fell into the hands of the band of Dositheus and Sosipater, and with many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> he besought them to let him go with his life, because he had the parents and brethren of many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who, by his death, might happen to be deceived.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when he had given his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that he would restore them according to the agreement, they let him go without hurt, for the saving of their brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> went away to Carnion, where he slew five and twenty thousand persons.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And after he had put to flight and destroyed these, he removed his army to Ephron, a strong city, wherein there dwelt a multitude of divers nations: and stout young men standing upon the walls, made a vigorous resistance: and in this place there were many engines of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and a provision of darts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But when they had invocated the Almighty, who with his power breaketh the strength of the enemies, they took the city: and slew five and twenty thousand of them that were within.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> From thence they departed to <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a>, which lieth six hundred furlongs from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Scythopolis...</strong> Formerly called <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were among the <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolitans</a> testifying that they were used kindly by them, and that even in the times of their adversity they had treated them with humanity:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> They gave them thanks, exhorting them to be still friendly to their nation, and so they came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the feast of the weeks being at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And after Pentecost they marched against Gorgias, the governor of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he came out with three thousand footmen and four hundred horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And when they had joined battle, it happened that a few of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But Dositheus, a horseman, one of Bacenor's band, a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, took hold of Gorgias: and when he would have taken him alive, a certain horseman of the Thracians came upon him, and cut off his shoulder: and so Gorgias escaped to Maresa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But when they that were with Esdrin had fought long, and were weary, <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to be their helper, and leader of the battle:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Then beginning in his own language, and singing hymns with a loud voice, he put Gorgias' soldiers to flight.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> So <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> having gathered together his army, came into the city <a href="../cathen/01162a.htm">Odollam</a>: and when the seventh day came, they purified themselves according to the custom, and kept the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> in the same place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And the day following <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> came with his company, to take away the bodies of them that were slain, and to bury them with their kinsmen, in the sepulchres of their fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they found under the coats of the slain, some of the donaries of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbiddeth to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: so that all plainly saw, that for this cause they were slain. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of the donaries, etc...</strong> That is, of the votive <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, which had been hung up in the temples of the idols, which they had taken away when they burnt the port of Jamnia, <a href="../douay/2ma012.htm#verse9">verse 9</a>, contrary to the prohibition of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, <a href="../douay/deu007.htm#verse25">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Then they all <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> judgment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who had discovered the things that were hidden.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And so betaking themselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, they besought him, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which had been committed might be forgotten. But the most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> exhorted the people to keep themselves from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, forasmuch as they saw before their eyes what had happened, because of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those that were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And making a gathering, he sent twelve thousand <a href="../cathen/05152b.htm">drachms</a> of silver to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to be offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the dead, thinking well and religiously concerning the resurrection.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> (For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a>, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the dead</a>),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> laid up for them. <span class="stiki"><strong>With godliness...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> hoped that these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who died fighting for the cause of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>, might find mercy: either because they might be excused from mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; or might have repented of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, at least at their death.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> It is therefore a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and wholesome thought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the dead, that they may be loosed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead...</strong> Here is an evident and undeniable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the practice of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">praying for the dead</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">old law</a>, which was then strictly observed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and consequently could not be introduced at that time by <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, their chief and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, if it had not been always their custom.</span></span></p>
