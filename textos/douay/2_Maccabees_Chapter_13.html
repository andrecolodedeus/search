<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 13</h1>
<div class="h1a">Antiochus and Lysias again invade Judea. Menelaus is put to death. The king's great army is worsted twice. The peace is renewed.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the year one hundred and forty-nine, <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> understood that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a multitude against <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And with him Lysias, the regent, who had charge over the affairs of the realm, having with him a hundred and ten thousand footmen, five thousand horsemen, twenty-two elephants, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks. <span class="stiki"><strong>A hundred and ten thousand, etc...</strong> The difference between the numbers here set down, and those recorded, <a href="../douay/1ma004.htm">1 Maccabees 4</a>, is easily accounted for; if we consider that such armies as these are liable to be at one time more numerous than at another; either by sending away large detachments, or being diminished by sickness; or increased by receiving fresh supplies of troops, according to different exigencies or occurrences.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Menelaus also joined himself with them: and with great deceitfulness besought Antiochus, not for the welfare of his country, but in hopes that he should be appointed chief ruler.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the King of kings stirred up the mind of Antiochus against the sinner, and upon Lysias suggesting that he was the cause of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, he commanded (as the custom is with them) that he should be apprehended and put to death in the same place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now there was in that place a tower fifty cubits high, having a heap of ashes on every side: this had a prospect steep down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> From thence he commanded the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> wretch to be thrown down into the ashes, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> thrusting him forward unto death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And by such a law it happened that Menelaus the transgressor of the law, was put to death: not having so much as burial in the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And indeed very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, for insomuch as he had committed many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the fire and ashes of which were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: he was condemned to die in ashes.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But the king, with his mind full of rage, came on to show himself worse to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> than his father was.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> understood, he commanded the people to call upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> day and night, that as he had always done, so now also he would help them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Because they were afraid to be deprived of the law, and of their country, and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and that he would not suffer the people, that had of late taken breath for a little while, to be again in subjection to blasphemous nations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So when they had all done this together, and had craved mercy of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with weeping and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, lying prostrate on the ground for three days continually, <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> exhorted them to make themselves ready.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But he, with the ancients, determined before the king should bring his army into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and make himself master of the city, to go out, and to commit the event of the thing to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So committing all to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of the world, and having exhorted his people to fight manfully, and to stand up even to death for the laws, the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, the city, their country, and citizens: he placed his army about Modin.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And having given his company for a watchword, The victory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> chosen young men, he set upon the king's quarter by night, and slew four thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the camp, and the greatest of the elephants, with them that had been upon him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And having filled the camp of the enemies with exceeding great fear and tumult, they went off with good success.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now this was done at the break of day, by the protection and help of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But the king having taken a taste of the hardiness of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, attempted to take the strong places by policy:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he marched with his army to Bethsura, which was a strong hold of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: but he was repulsed, he failed, he lost his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> sent necessaries to them that were within</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But Rhodocus, one of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> army, disclosed the secrets to the enemies, so he was sought out, and taken up, and put in prison.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Again the king treated with them that were in Bethsura: gave his right hand: took theirs: and went away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> He fought with <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>: and was overcome. And when he understood that Philip, who had been left over the affairs, had rebelled at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, he was in a consternation of mind, and intreating the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and yielding to them, he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to all things that seemed reasonable, and, being reconciled, offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, honoured the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and left gifts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He embraced <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a>, and made him governor and prince from <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a> unto the Gerrenians.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But when he was come to <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that city were much displeased with the conditions of the peace, being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for fear they should break the covenant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then Lysias went up to the judgment seat, and set forth the reason, and appeased the people, and returned to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>: and thus matters went with regard to the king's coming and his return.</span></p>
