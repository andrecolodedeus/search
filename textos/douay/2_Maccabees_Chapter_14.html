<div class="h1a">Demetrius challenges the kingdom. Alcimus applies to him to be made high priest: Nicanor is sent into Judea: his dealings with Judas: his threats. The history of Razias.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But after the space of three years <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and they that were with him, understood that Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, was come up with a great power, and a navy by the haven of Tripolis, to places proper for his purpose,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And had made himself master of the countries against Antiochus, and his general, Lysias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now one <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">chief priest</a>, but had wilfully defiled himself in the time of mingling with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, seeing that there was no safety for him, nor access to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, <span class="stiki"><strong>Now Alcimus, who had been chief priest...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> was of the stock of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, but for his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> here mentioned was incapable of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>, but king Antiochus Eupator appointed him in place of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, (see above, <a href="../douay/1ma007.htm#verse9">1 Maccabees 7:9</a>), as Menelaus had been before him, set up by Antiochus (<a href="../douay/2ma004.htm">2 Maccabees 4</a>), yet neither of them were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> was amongst the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabees</a>, who were also of the stock of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and had strictly held their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>, and were ordained according to the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">rites</a> commanded in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>. -- Ibid. <strong>Mingling...</strong> with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>; that is, in their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous worship</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Came to king Demetrius in the year one hundred and fifty, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and besides these, some boughs that seemed to belong to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>. And that day indeed he held his peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But having gotten a convenient time to further his madness, being called to counsel by Demetrius, and asked what the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> relied upon, and what were their counsels,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He answered thereunto: They among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that are called <a href="../cathen/01800b.htm">Assideans</a>, of whom <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a> is <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>, nourish wars, and raise seditions, and will not suffer the realm to be in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For I also being deprived of my ancestor's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (I mean of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>) am now come hither:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Principally indeed out of fidelity to the king's interests, but in the next place also to provide for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of my countrymen: for all our nation suffereth much from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> proceedings of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Wherefore, O king, seeing thou knowest all these things, take care, I beseech thee, both of the country, and of our nation, according to thy humanity which is known to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For as long as <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> liveth it is not possible that the state should be quiet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now when this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had spoken to this effect the rest also of the king's friends, who were enemies of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, incensed Demetrius against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And forthwith he sent Nicanor, the commander over the elephants, governor into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Giving him in charge, to take <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> himself: and disperse all them that were with him, and to make <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">great temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who had fled out of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, from <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the miseries and calamities of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to be the welfare of their affairs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> heard of Nicanor's coming, and that the nations were assembled against them, they cast earth upon their heads, and made supplication to him who chose his people to keep them for ever, and who protected his portion by evident signs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then at the commandment of their <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>, they forthwith removed from the place where they were, and went to the town of Dessau, to meet them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now Simon, the brother of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, had joined battle with Nicanor: but was frightened with the sudden coming of the adversaries.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Nevertheless Nicanor hearing of the valour of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas'</a> companions, and the greatness of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, with which they fought for their country, was afraid to try the matter by the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotius and Matthias before to present and receive the right hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when there had been a consultation thereupon, and the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> had acquainted the multitude with it, they were all of one mind to consent to covenants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> So they appointed a day upon which they might come together by themselves: and seats were brought out, and set for each one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> ordered armed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be ready in convenient places, lest some mischief might be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made an agreeable conference.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Nicanor abode in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and did no wrong, but sent away the flocks of the multitudes that had been gathered together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> was always dear to him from the heart, and he was well affected to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he desired him to <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> a wife, and to have children. So he <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a>: he lived quietly, and they lived in common.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> seeing the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they had one to another, and the covenants, came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor had assented to the foreign interest, for that he meant to make <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, who was a traitor to the kingdom, his successor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Then the king, being in a rage, and provoked with this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> accusation, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was greatly displeased with the covenant of friendship: and that he commanded him nevertheless to send <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> prisoner in all haste to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> When this was known, Nicanor was in a consternation, and took it grievously that he should make void the articles that were agreed upon, having received no injury from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But because he could not oppose the king, he watched an opportunity to comply with the orders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But when <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> perceived that Nicanor was more stern to him, and that when they met together as usual he behaved himself in a rough manner; and was sensible that this rough behaviour came not of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, he gathered together a few of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and hid himself from Nicanor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But he finding himself notably prevented by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, came to the great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and commanded the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that were <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> the accustomed <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, to deliver him the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> unto him, that they knew not where the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was whom he sought, he stretched out his hand to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a>, saying: Unless you deliver <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> prisoner to me, I will lay this <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> even with the ground, and will beat down the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and I will <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicate</a> this <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> to Bacchus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And when he had spoken thus, he departed. But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stretching forth their hands to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, called upon him that was ever the defender of their nation, saying in this manner:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of all things, who wantest nothing, wast pleased that the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> of thy habitation should be amongst us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Therefore now, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of all holies, keep this house for ever undefiled, which was lately cleansed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Now Razias, one of the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, was accused to Nicanor, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was a lover of the city, and of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> report, who for his kindness was called the father of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for a long time, had held fast his purpose of keeping himself pure in the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews' religion</a>, and was ready to expose his body and life, that he might persevere therein.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> So Nicanor being willing to declare the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> that he bore the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, sent five hundred soldiers to take him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> For he thought by ensnaring him to hurt the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> very much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Now as the multitude sought to rush into his house, and to break open the door, and to set fire to it, when he was ready to be taken, he struck himself with his sword: <span class="stiki"><strong>He struck himself, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (Epist. 61, ad Dulcitium, et lib. 2, cap. 23, ad Epist. 2, Gaud.) discussing this fact of Razias, says, that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">holy scripture</a> relates it, but doth not praise it, as to be admired or imitated, and that either it was not well done by him, or at least not proper in this time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Choosing to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of the wicked, and to suffer abuses unbecoming his noble birth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> But whereas through haste he missed of giving a sure wound, and the crowd was breaking into the doors, he ran boldly to the wall, and manfully threw himself down to the crowd:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> But they quickly making room for his fall, he came upon the midst of the neck. <span class="stiki"><strong>He came upon the midst of the neck...</strong> <em>Venit per mediam cervicem</em>. In the Greek it is <em>keneona</em>, which signifies a void place, where there is no building.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And as he had yet breath in him, being inflamed in mind, he arose: and while his blood ran down with a great stream, and he was grievously wounded, he ran through the crowd:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And standing upon a steep rock, when he was now almost without blood, grasping his bowels, with both hands he cast them upon the throng, calling upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of life and spirit, to restore these to him again: and so he departed this life.</span></p>
