<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 15</h1>
<div class="h1a">Judas encouraged by a vision gains a glorious victory over Nicanor. The conclusion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But when Nicanor understood that <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> was in the places of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, he purposed to set upon him with all <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were constrained to follow him, said: Do not act so fiercely and barbarously, but give honour to the day that is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>: and reverence him that beholdeth all things:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> That unhappy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> asked, if there were a mighty One in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, that had commanded the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a> to be kept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they answered: There is the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> himself in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the mighty One, that commanded the seventh day to be kept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then he said: And I am mighty upon the earth, and I command to take arms, and to do the king's business. Nevertheless he prevailed not to accomplish his design.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So Nicanor being puffed up with exceeding great <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, thought to set up a public monument of his victory over <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> ever trusted with all hope that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would help them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the nations, but to remember the help they had before received from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and now to hope for victory from the Almighty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And speaking to them out of the law, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and withal putting them in mind of the battles they had fought before, he made them more cheerful:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then after he had encouraged them, he showed withal the falsehood of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and their breach of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> So he armed every one of them, not with defence of shield and spear, but with very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> speeches, and exhortations, and told them a dream worthy to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, whereby he rejoiced them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now the vision was in this manner. <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and virtuous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, modest in his looks, gentle in his manners, and graceful in speech, and who from a child was exercised in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> holding up his hands, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for all the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> After this there appeared also another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, admirable for age, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and environed with great beauty and majesty:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a> answering, said: This is a lover of his brethren, and of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: this is he that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayeth</a> much for the people, and for all the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>, <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah, the prophet of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Whereupon <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a> stretched forth his right hand, and gave to <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> a sword of gold, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Take this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sword, a gift from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherewith thou shalt overthrow the adversaries of my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Thus being exhorted with the words of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, which were very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and proper to stir up the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and strengthen the hearts of the young men, they resolved to fight, and to set upon them manfully: that valour might decide the matter, because the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> were in danger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For their concern was less for their wives, and children, and for their brethren, and kinsfolk: but their greatest and principal fear was for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they also that were in the city, had no little concern for them that were to be engaged in battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And now when all expected what judgment would be given, and the enemies were at hand, and the army was set in array, the beasts and the horsemen ranged in convenient places,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> considering the coming of the multitude, and the divers preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretching out his hands to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that worketh wonders, who giveth victory to them that are worthy, not according to the power of their arms, but according as it seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> he said after this manner: Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who didst send thy <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and didst kill a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the army of Sennacherib:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Send now also, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, thy <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">good angel</a> before us, for the fear and dread of the greatness of thy arm,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> That they may be afraid, who come with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people. And thus he concluded his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But Nicanor, and they that were with him came forward, with trumpets and songs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, and they that were with him, encountered them, calling upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> So fighting with their hands, but <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with their hearts, they slew no less than five and thirty thousand, being greatly cheered with the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when the battle was over, and they were returning with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, they understood that Nicanor was slain in his armour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then making a shout, and a great noise, they <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty Lord</a> in their own language.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, who was altogether ready, in body and mind, to die for his countrymen, commanded that Nicanor's head, and his hand, with the shoulder, should be cut off, and carried to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when he was come thither, having called together his countrymen, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, he sent also for them that were in the castle,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And showing them the head of Nicanor, and the wicked hand, which he had stretched out, with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> boasts, against the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">holy house of the Almighty God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> He commanded also, that the tongue of the wicked Nicanor should be cut out, and given by pieces to birds, and the hand of the furious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be hanged up over against the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Then all <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he hung up Nicanor's head in the top of the castle, that it might be an evident and manifest sign of the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And they all ordained by a common decree, by no means to let this day pass without solemnity:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But to celebrate the thirteenth day of the month of <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a>, called in the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> language, the day before Mardochias' day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> So these things being done with relation to Nicanor, and from that time the city being possessed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, I also will here make an end of my narration.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Which if I have done well, and as it becometh the history, it is what I desired: but if not so perfectly, it must be pardoned me. <span class="stiki"><strong>If not so perfectly, etc...</strong> This is not said with regard to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the narration; but with regard to the style and manner of writing: which in the sacred penmen is not always the most accurate. See <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../douay/2co011.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> For as it is hurtful to drink always wine, or always water, but pleasant to use sometimes the one, and sometimes the other: so if the speech be always nicely framed, it will not be grateful to the readers. But here it shall be ended.</span></p>
