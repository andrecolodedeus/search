<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">A continuation of the second letter. Of Jeremiah' hiding the ark at the time of the captivity. The author's preface.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now it is found in the descriptions of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah, the prophet</a>, that he commanded them that went into captivity, to take the fire, as it hath been signified, and how he gave charge to them that were carried away into captivity. <span class="stiki"><strong>The descriptions...</strong> That is, the records or memoirs of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a>, a work that is now lost.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And how he gave them the law, that they should not forget the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and that they should not err in their minds, seeing the idols of gold, and silver, and the ornaments of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And with other such like speeches, he exhorted them that they would not remove the law from their heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> It was also contained in the same writing, how the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, being warned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, commanded that the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> should accompany him, till he came forth to the mountain where <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> went up, and saw the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a> came thither he found a hollow cave: and he carried in thither the tabernacle, and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ib">altar of incense</a>, and so stopped the door.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then some of them that followed him, came up to mark the place: but they could not find it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a> perceived it, he blamed them, saying: The place shall be unknown, till <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gather together the congregation of the people, and receive them to mercy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And then the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will show these things, and the majesty of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall appear, and there shall be a cloud as it was also showed to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and he showed it when <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the place might be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> to the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For he treated wisdom in a magnificent manner: and like a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he offered the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a>, and of the finishing of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and fire came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and consumed the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>: so <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and fire came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and consumed the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: Because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> was not eaten, it was consumed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> also celebrated the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> eight days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And these same things were set down in the memoirs, and commentaries of Nehemias: and how he made a library, and gathered together out of the countries, the books both of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistles</a> of the kings, and concerning the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gifts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And in like manner Judas also gathered together all such things as were lost by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> we had, and they are in our possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Wherefore, if you want these things, send some that may fetch them to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> As we are then about to celebrate the purification, we have written unto you: and you shall do well, if you keep the same days. <span class="stiki"><strong>The purification...</strong> That is, the feast of the purifying or cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And we hope that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hath delivered his people, and hath rendered to all the inheritance, and the kingdom, and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the sanctuary,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> As he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and will gather us together from every land under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For he hath delivered us out of great perils, and hath cleansed the place.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now as concerning <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>, and his brethren, and the purification of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">great temple</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> As also the wars against Antiochus, the Illustrious, and his son, Eupator:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the manifestations that came from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to them, that behaved themselves manfully on the behalf of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, so that, being but a few they made themselves masters of the whole country, and put to flight the barbarous multitude:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And recovered again the most renowned <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> in all the world, and delivered the city, and restored the laws that were abolished, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with all clemency showing mercy to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And all such things as have been comprised in five books by <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a>, of Cyrene, we have attempted to abridge in one book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For considering the multitude of books, and the difficulty that they find that desire to undertake the narrations of histories, because of the multitude of the matter,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> We have taken care for those indeed that are willing to read, that it might be a pleasure of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: and for the studious, that they may more easily commit to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>: and that all that read might receive profit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And as to ourselves indeed, in undertaking this work of abridging, we have taken in hand no easy task; yea, rather a business full of watching and sweat. <span class="stiki"><strong>No easy task, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a>, that assists the sacred penmen, does not exempt them from labour in seeking out the matter which they are to treat of, and the order and manner in which they are to deliver it. So <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> writ the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> having diligently attained to all things. <a href="../douay/luk001.htm#verse3">Luke 1:3</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But as they that prepare a feast, and seek to satisfy the will of others: for the sake of many, we willingly undergo the labour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Leaving to the authors the exact handling of every particular, and as for ourselves, according to the plan proposed, studying to be brief.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For as the master builder of a new house must have care of the whole building: but he that taketh care to paint it, must seek out fit things for the adorning of it: so must it be judged of us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For to collect all that is to be known, to put the discourse in order, and curiously to discuss every particular point, is the duty of the author of a history:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But to pursue brevity of speech, and to avoid nice declarations of things, is to be granted to him that maketh an abridgment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Here then we will begin the narration: let this be enough by way of a preface: for it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue, and to be short in the story itself.</span></p>
