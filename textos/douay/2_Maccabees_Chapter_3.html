<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 3</h1>
<div class="h1a">Heliodorus is sent by King Seleucus to take away the treasures deposited in the temple. He is struck by God, and healed by the prayers of the high priest.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a> was inhabited with all peace, and the laws as yet were very well kept, because of the godliness of <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> It came to pass that even the kings themselves and the princes esteemed the place worthy of the highest honour, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> with very great gifts:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So that Seleucus, king of Asia, allowed out of his revenues all the charges belonging to the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Seleucus...</strong> Son of Antiochus the Great, and elder brother of Antiochus Epiphanes.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But one Simon, of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>, who was appointed overseer of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, strove in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, to bring about some <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> thing in the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when he could not overcome <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, he went to Apollonius, the son of Tharseas, who at that time was governor of Celesyria, and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phenicia</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And told him, that the treasury in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was full of immense sums of money, and the common store was infinite, which did not belong to the account of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: and that it was possible to bring all into the king's hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now when Apollonius had given the king notice concerning the money that he was told of, he called for Heliodorus, who had the charge over his affairs, and sent him with commission to bring him the foresaid money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So Heliodorus forthwith began his journey, under a colour of visiting the cities of Celesyria and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phenicia</a>, but indeed to fulfil the king's purpose.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when he was come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and had been courteously received in the city by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, he told him what information had been given concerning the money: and declared the cause for which he was come: and asked if these things were so indeed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> told him that these were sums deposited, and provisions for the subsistence of the widows and the fatherless:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And that some part of that which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Simon had given intelligence of belonged to Hircanus, son of Tobias, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of great dignity; and that the whole was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But that to deceive them who had trusted to the place and <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> which is honoured throughout the whole world, for the reverence and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of it, was a thing which could not by any means be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But he, by reason of the orders he had received from the king, said, that by all means the money must be carried to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So on the day he had appointed, Heliodorus entered in to order this matter. But there was no small terror throughout the whole city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> prostrated themselves before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> in their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests'</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, and called upon him from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, who made the law concerning things given to be kept, that he would preserve them safe, for them that had deposited them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now whosoever saw the countenance of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, was wounded in heart: for his face, and the changing of his colour, declared the inward sorrow of his mind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was so compassed with sadness and horror of the body, that it was manifest to them that beheld him, what sorrow he had in his heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Others also came flocking together out of their houses, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and making public supplication, because the place was like to come into contempt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, girded with haircloth about their breasts, came together in the streets. And the virgins also that were shut up, came forth, some to <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And all holding up their hands towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> made supplication.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For the expectation of the mixed multitude, and of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, who was in an agony, would have moved any one to pity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And these indeed called upon almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to preserve the things that had been committed to them safe and sure for those that had committed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But Heliodorus executed that which he had resolved on, himself being present in the same place with his guard about the treasury.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Almighty God</a> gave a great evidence of his presence, so that all that had presumed to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him, falling down by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were struck with fainting and dread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For there appeared to them a horse, with a terrible rider upon him, adorned with a very rich covering: and he ran fiercely and struck Heliodorus with his fore feet, and he that sat upon him seemed to have armour of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Moreover there appeared two other young men, beautiful and strong, bright and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and in comely apparel: who stood by him, on either side, and scourged him without ceasing with many stripes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground, and they took him up, covered with great darkness, and having put him into a litter, they carried him out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So he that came with many servants, and all his guard, into the aforesaid treasury, was carried out, no one being able to help him, the manifest power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being known.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he indeed, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lay speechless, and without all hope of recovery.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But they praised the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, because he had <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> his place: and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, that a little before was full of fear and trouble, when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty Lord</a> appeared, was filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy and gladness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then some of the friends of Heliodorus forthwith begged of <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, that he would call upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High</a> to grant him his life, who was ready to give up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> So the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, considering that the king might perhaps suspect that some mischief had been done to Heliodorus by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, offered a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of health for the recovery of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, the same young men in the same clothing stood by Heliodorus, and said to him: Give thanks to <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: because for his sake the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath granted thee life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And thou having been scourged by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, declare unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the great works and the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And having spoken thus, they appeared no more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> So Heliodorus, after he had offered a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and made great <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to him, that had granted him life, and given thanks to <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, taking his troops with him, returned to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he testified to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the works of the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he had seen with his own eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And when the king asked Heliodorus, who might be a fit <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be sent yet once more to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> If thou hast any enemy, or traitor to thy kingdom, send him thither, and thou shalt receive him again scourged, if so be he escape: for there is undoubtedly in that place a certain power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">he that hath his dwelling in the heavens</a>, is the visitor and protector of that place, and he striketh and destroyeth them that come to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury, fell out in this manner.</span></p>
