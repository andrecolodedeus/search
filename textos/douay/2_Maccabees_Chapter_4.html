<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">Onias has recourse to the king. The ambition and wickedness of Jason and Menelaus. Onias is treacherously murdered.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But Simon, of whom we spoke before, who was the betrayer of the money, and of his country, spoke ill of <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, as though he had incited Heliodorus to do these things, and had been the promoter of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he presumed to call him a traitor to the kingdom, who provided for the city, and defended his nation, and was zealous for the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But when the enmities proceeded so far, that murders also were committed by some of Simon's friends:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, considering the danger of this contention, and that Apollonius, who was the governor of Celesyria, and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phenicia</a>, was outrageous, which increased the malice of Simon, went to the king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Not to be an accuser of his countrymen, but with a view to the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of all the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For he saw that, except the king took care, it was impossible that matters should be settled in peace, or that Simon would cease from his folly.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, who was called the Illustrious, had taken possession of the kingdom, <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a>, the brother of <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, ambitiously sought the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And went to the king, promising him three hundred and sixty talents of silver, and out of other revenues fourscore talents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Besides this he promised also a hundred and fifty more, if he might have license to set him up a place for exercise, and a place for youth, and to entitle them that were at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Antiochians.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten the rule into his hands, forthwith he began to bring over his countrymen to the fashion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And abolishing those things, which had been decreed of special favour by the kings in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, by the means of John, the father of that Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome to make amity and alliance, he disannulled the lawful ordinances of the citizens, and brought in fashions that were perverse.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For he had the boldness to set up, under the very castle, a place of exercise, and to put all the choicest youths in brothel houses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now this was not the beginning, but an increase, and progress of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenish</a> and foreign manners, through the abominable and unheard of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a>, that impious wretch, and no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Insomuch that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were not now occupied about the offices of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, but despising the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and neglecting the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, hastened to be partakers of the games, and of the unlawful allowance thereof, and of the exercise of the discus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And setting nought by the honours of their fathers, they esteemed the Grecian <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> for the best:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For the sake of which they incurred a dangerous contention, and followed earnestly their ordinances, and in all things they <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> to be like them, who were their enemies and murderers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For acting <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a> against the laws of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not pass unpunished: but this the time following will declare.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Now when the game that was used every fifth year was kept at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, the king being present,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> sent from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to carry three hundred didrachmas of silver for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Hercules; but the bearers thereof desired it might not be bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, because it was not necessary, but might be deputed for other charges.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So the money was appointed by him that sent it to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Hercules: but because of them that carried it was employed for the making of galleys.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now when Apollonius the son of Mnestheus was sent into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to treat with the nobles of king Philometor, and Antiochus understood that he was wholly excluded from the affairs of the kingdom, consulting his own interest, he departed thence and came to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, and from thence to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Where he was received in a magnificent manner by <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a>, and the city, and came in with torch lights, and with praises, and from thence he returned with his army into <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phenicia</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Three years afterwards <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> sent Menelaus, brother of the aforesaid Simon, to carry money to the king, and to bring answers from him concerning certain necessary affairs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But he being recommended to the king, when he had magnified the appearance of his power, got the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> for himself, by <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> more than <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> by three hundred talents of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> So having received the king's mandate, he returned, bringing nothing worthy of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a>: but having the mind of a cruel tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a>, who had undermined his own brother, being himself undermined, was driven out a fugitive into the country of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money he had promised to the king, he took no care, when Sostratus, the governor of the castle, called for it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For to him appertained the gathering of the taxes: wherefore they were both called before the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And Menelaus was removed from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, Lysimachus, his brother, succeeding: and Sostratus was alas made governor of the <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> When these things were in doing, it fell out that they of Tharsus, and Mallos, raised a sedition, because they were given for a gift to Antiochus, the king's <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> The king, therefore, went in all haste to appease them, leaving Andronicus, one of his nobles, for his deputy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Then Menelaus supposing that he had found a convenient time, having stolen certain vessels of gold out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, gave them to Andronicus, and others he had sold at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and in the neighbouring cities:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a> understood most certainly, he reproved him, keeping himself in a safe place at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, beside Daphne.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Whereupon Menelaus coming to Andronicus, desired him to kill <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>. And he went to <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, and gave him his right hand with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and (though he were suspected by him) persuaded him to come forth out of the sanctuary, and immediately slew him, without any regard to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> For which cause not only the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but also the other nations, conceived indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of so great a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And when the king was come back from the places of Cilicia, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and also the Greeks, went to him: complaining of the unjust murder of <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Antiochus, therefore, was grieved in his mind for <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, and being moved to pity, shed tears, remembering the sobriety and modesty of the deceased.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And being inflamed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, he commanded Andronicus to be stripped of his purple, and to be led about through all the city: and that in the same place wherein he had committed the impiety against <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> wretch should be put to death, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> repaying him his deserved punishment.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Now when many <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrileges</a> had been committed by Lysimachus in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, by the counsel of Menelaus, and the rumour of it was spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, a great quantity of gold being already carried away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Wherefore the multitude making an insurrection, and their minds being filled with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, Lysimachus armed about three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and began to use <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, one Tyrannus being <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> far gone both in age and in madness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But when they perceived the attempt of Lysimachus, some caught up stones, some strong clubs, and some threw ashes upon Lysimachus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And many of them were wounded, and some struck down to the ground, but all were put to flight: and as for the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> fellow himself, they slew him beside the treasury.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Now concerning these matters, an accusation was laid against Menelaus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And when the king was come to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, three <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were sent from the ancients to plead the cause before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> But Menelaus being convicted, promised Ptolemee to give him much money to persuade the king to favour him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Ptolemee...</strong> The son of Dorymenus, a favourite of the king.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> So Ptolemee went to the king in a certain <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> where he was, as it were to cool himself, and brought him to be of another mind:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> So Menelaus, who was guilty of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, was acquitted by him of the accusations: and those <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who, if they had pleaded their cause even before Scythians, should have been judged innocent, were condemned to death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Thus they that prosecuted the cause for the city, and for the people, and the sacred vessels, did soon suffer <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> punishment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Wherefore even the Tyrians, being moved with indignation, were very liberal towards their burial.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And so through the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> of them that were in power, Menelaus continued in authority, increasing in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> to the betraying of the citizens.</span></p>
