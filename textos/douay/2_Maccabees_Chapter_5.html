<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">Wonderful signs are seen in the air. Jason's wickedness and end. Antiochus takes Jerusalem, and plunders the temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> At the same time Antiochus prepared for a second journey into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And it came to pass, that through the whole city of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, for the space of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, in gilded raiment, and armed with spears, like bands of soldiers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And horses set in order by ranks, running one against another, with the shakings of shields, and a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in helmets, with drawn swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden armour, and of harnesses of all sorts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Wherefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that these prodigies might turn to <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now when there was gone forth a false rumour as though Antiochus had been dead, <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> taking with him no fewer than a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, suddenly assaulted the city: and though the citizens ran together to the wall, the city at length was taken, and Menelaus fled into the castle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> slew his countrymen without mercy, not considering that prosperity against one's own kindred is a very great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, thinking they had been enemies, and not citizens, whom he conquered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Yet he did not get the principality, but received confusion at the end, for the reward of his treachery, and fled again into the country of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> At the last, having been shut up by Aretas, the king of the Arabians, in order for his destruction, flying from city to city, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as a forsaker of the laws and execrable, as an enemy of his country and countrymen, he was thrust out into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he that had driven many out of their country perished in a strange land, going to Lacedemon, as if for kindred sake he should have refuge there:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But he that had cast out many unburied, was himself cast forth both unlamented and unburied, neither having foreign burial, nor being partaker of the sepulchre of his fathers.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now when these things were done, the king suspected that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would forsake the alliance: whereupon departing out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And commanded the soldiers to kill, and not to spare any that came in their way, and to go up into the houses to slay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thus there was a slaughter of young and old, destruction of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, and killing of virgins and infants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And there were slain in the space of three whole days fourscore thousand, forty thousand were made prisoners, and as many sold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But this was not enough, he presumed also to enter into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in all the world Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his country, being his guide.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And taking in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hands the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vessels, which were given by other kings and cities, for the ornament and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the place, he unworthily handled and profaned them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Thus Antiochus going astray in mind, did not consider that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for a while, because of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the inhabitants of the city: and therefore this contempt had happened to the place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Otherwise had they not been involved in many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as Heliodorus, who was sent by king Seleucus to rob the treasury, so this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also, as soon as he had come, had been forthwith scourged, and put back from his <a href="../cathen/12403a.htm">presumption</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place for the people's sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And, therefore, the place also itself was made partaker of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the people: but afterwards shall communicate in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things thereof, and as it was forsaken in the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, shall be exalted again with great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall be reconciled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> So when Antiochus had taken away out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> a thousand and eight hundred talents, he went back in all haste to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, thinking through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> that he might now make the land navigable, and the sea passable on foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He left also governors to afflict the people: at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Philip, a Phrygian by birth, but in manners more barbarous than he that set him there:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And in Gazarim, Andronicus and Menelaus, who bore a more heavy hand upon the citizens than the rest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And whereas he was set against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he sent that hateful prince, Apollonius, with an army of two and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, commanding him to kill all that were of perfect age, and to sell the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the younger sort.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Who, when he was come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, pretending peace, rested till the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>: and then the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> keeping holiday, he commanded his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to take arms.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he slew all that were come forth to flee: and running through the city with armed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he destroyed a very great multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>, who was the tenth, had withdrawn himself into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a>, and there lived amongst wild beasts in the mountains with his company: and they continued feeding on herbs, that they might not be partakers of the pollution. <span class="stiki"><strong>Was the tenth...</strong> That is, he had nine others in his company.</span></span></p>
