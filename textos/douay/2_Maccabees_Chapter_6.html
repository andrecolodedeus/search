<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">Antiochus commands the law to be abolished, sets up an idol in the temple, and persecutes the faithful. The martyrdom of Eleazar.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But not long after the king sent a certain old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, to compel the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to depart from the laws of their fathers and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And to defile the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> that was in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and to call it the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Jupiter Olympius: and that in Gazarim of Jupiter Hospitalis, according as they were that inhabited the place. <span class="stiki"><strong>That in Gazarim...</strong> Viz., the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>. And as they were originally strangers, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of Hospitalis (which signifies of or belonging to strangers) was applicable to the idol set up in their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And very bad was this invasion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and grievous to all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was full of the riot and revellings of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and of men lying with lewd <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> thrust themselves of their accord into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, and brought in things that were not lawful.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> also was filled with unlawful things, which were forbidden by the laws.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And neither were the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> kept, nor the solemn days of the fathers observed, neither did any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> plainly profess himself to be a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But they were led by bitter constraint on the king's birthday to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: and when the feast of Bacchus was kept, they were compelled to go about crowned with ivy in honour of Bacchus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And there went out a decree into the neighbouring cities of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, by the suggestion of the Ptolemeans, that they also should act in like manner against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to oblige them to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And whosoever would not conform themselves to the ways of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, should be put to death: then was misery to be seen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were accused to have <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> their children: whom, when they had openly led about through the city, with the infants hanging at their breasts, they threw down headlong from the walls.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And others that had met together in caves that were near, and were keeping the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a> privately, being discovered by Philip, were burnt with fire, because they made a <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to help themselves with their hands, by reason of the religious observance of the day. <span class="stiki"><strong>Philip...</strong> The governor of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now I beseech those that shall read this book, that they be not shocked at these calamities, but that they consider the things that happened, not as being for the destruction, but for the correction of our nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For it is a token of great goodness, when sinners are not suffered to go on in their ways for a long time, but are presently punished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For, not as with other nations, (whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> patiently expecteth, that when the day of judgment shall come, he may punish them in the fulness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>:)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Doth he also deal with us, so as to suffer our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to come to their height, and then take vengeance on us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: but though he chastise his people with adversity he forsaketh them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But let this suffice in a few words for a warning to the readers. And now we must come to the narration.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> one of the chief of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> advanced in years, and of a comely countenance, was pressed to open his mouth to eat swine's flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But he, choosing rather a most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> death than a hateful life, went forward voluntarily to the torment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And considering in what manner he was to come to it, patiently bearing, he determined not to do any unlawful things for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But they that stood by, being moved with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> pity, for the old friendship they had with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, taking him aside, desired that flesh might be brought which it was lawful for him to eat, that he might make as if he had eaten, as the king had commanded, of the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>Wicked pity...</strong> Their pity was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, inasmuch as it suggested that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> proposal of saving his <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> by <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">dissimulation</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> That by so doing he might be delivered from death; and for the sake of their old friendship with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they did him this courtesy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he began to consider the dignity of his age, and his ancient years, and the inbred honour of his grey head, and his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life and conversation from a child; and he answered without delay, according to the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> law made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, that he would rather be sent into the other world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For it doth not become our age, said he, to dissemble: whereby many young persons might think that <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a>, at the age of fourscore and ten years, was gone over to the life of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And so they, through my dissimulation, and for a little time of a corruptible life, should be deceived, and hereby I should bring a stain and a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> upon my old age.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For though, for the present time, I should be delivered from the punishments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, yet should I not escape the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty</a> neither alive nor dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Wherefore, by departing manfully out of this life, I shall show myself worthy of my old age:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And I shall leave an example of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to young men, if with a ready mind and constancy I suffer an honourable death, for the most venerable and most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> laws. And having spoken thus, he was forthwith carried to execution.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they that led him, and had been a little before more mild, were changed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> for the words he had spoken, which they thought were uttered out of arrogancy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But when he was now ready to die with the stripes, he groaned: and said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who hast the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> knowledge, thou knowest manifestly that whereas I might be delivered from death, I suffer grievous pains in body: but in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> am well content to suffer these things, because I fear thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Thus did this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> die, leaving not only to young men, but also to the whole nation, the memory of his death, for an example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.</span></p>
