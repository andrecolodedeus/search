<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">The glorious martyrdom of the seven brethren and their mother.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> It came to pass also, that seven brethren, together with their mother, were apprehended, and compelled by the king to eat swine's flesh against the law, for which end they were tormented with whips and scourges.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But one of them, who was the eldest, said thus: What wouldst thou ask, or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, received from our fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then the king being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, commanded frying pans and brazen caldrons to be made hot: which forthwith being heated,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He commanded to cut out the tongue of him that had spoken first: and the skin of his head being drawn off, to chop off also the extremities of his hands and feet, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when he was now maimed in all parts, he commanded him, being yet alive, to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the frying pan: and while he was suffering therein long torments, the rest, together with the mother, exhorted one another to die manfully,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> will look upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and will take pleasure in us, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> declared in the profession of the canticle; And in his servants he will take pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So when the first was dead after this manner, they brought the next to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him if he would eat, before he were punished throughout the whole body in every limb.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But he answered in his own language, and said: I will not do it. Wherefore he also, in the next place, received the torments of the first:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when he was at the last gasp, he said thus: Thou indeed, O most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, destroyest us out of this present life: but the King of the world will raise us up, who die for his laws, in the resurrection of eternal life.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> After him the third was made a mocking stock, and when he was required, he quickly put forth his tongue, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> stretched out his hands:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And said with confidence: These I have from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but for the laws of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I now <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> them, because I hope to receive them again from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So that the king, and they that were with him, wondered at the young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, because he esteemed the torments as nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And after he was thus dead, they tormented the fourth in the like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when he was now ready to die, he spoke thus: It is better, being put to death by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to look for hope from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be raised up again by him; for, as to thee, thou shalt have no resurrection unto life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when they had brought the fifth, they tormented him. But he, looking upon the king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Said: Whereas thou hast power among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> though thou art corruptible, thou dost what thou wilt but think not that our nation is forsaken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But stay patiently a while, and thou shalt see his great power, in what manner he will torment thee and thy seed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> After him they brought the sixth, and he being ready to die, spoke thus: Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and things worthy of admiration are done to us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But do not think that thou shalt escape unpunished, for that thou hast attempted to fight against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now the mother was to be admired above measure, and worthy to be remembered by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who beheld her seven sons slain in the space of one day, and bore it with a good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, for the hope that she had in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And she bravely exhorted every one of them in her own language, being filled with wisdom; and joining a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> thought,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> She said to them: I know not how you were formed in my womb; for I neither gave you breath, nor <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor life, neither did I frame the limbs of every one of you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But the Creator of the world, that formed the nativity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that found out the origin of all, he will restore to you again, in his mercy, both breath and life, as now you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> yourselves for the sake of his laws.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now Antiochus, thinking himself <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>, and withal despising the voice of the upbraider, when the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, that he would make him a rich and a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers, would take him for a friend, and furnish him with things necessary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But when the young man was not moved with these things, the king called the mother, and counselled her to deal with the young man to save his life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when he had exhorted her with many words she promised that she would counsel her son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> So bending herself towards him, mocking the cruel tyrant, she said in her own language: My son have pity upon me, that bore thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee suck three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> I beseech thee, my son, look upon <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, and all that is in them, and consider that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made them out of nothing, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> also:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So thou shalt not fear this tormentor, but being made a worthy partner with thy brethren, receive death, that in that mercy I may receive thee again with thy brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> While she was yet speaking these words, the young man said: For whom do you stay? I will not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commandment of the king, but the commandment of the law which was given us by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But thou that hast been the author of all mischief against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, shalt not escape the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> For we suffer thus for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And though the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us a little while, for our chastisement and correction, yet he will be reconciled again to his servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But thou, O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most flagitious, be not lifted up without cause with vain hopes, whilst thou art raging against his servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, who beholdeth all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For my brethren having now undergone a short pain, are under the covenant of eternal life: but thou, by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shalt receive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment for thy <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But I, like my brethren, offer up my life and my body for the laws of our fathers: calling upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be speedily merciful to our nation, and that thou by torments and stripes mayst confess that he alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But in me, and in my brethren, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the Almighty, which hath <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> been brought upon all our nation, shall cease.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Then the king being incensed with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, raged against him more cruelly than all the rest, taking it grievously that he was mocked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> So this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also died undefiled, wholly trusting in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And last of all, after the sons, the mother also was consumed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> But now there is enough said of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and of the excessive cruelties.</span></p>
