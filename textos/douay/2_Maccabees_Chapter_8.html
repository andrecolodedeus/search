<div class="h1a">Judas Maccabee gathering an army gains various victories.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>, and they that were with him, went privately into the towns: and calling together their kinsmen and friends, and taking unto them such as continued in the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews' religion</a>, they assembled six thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that he would look upon his people that was trodden down by all and would have pity on the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, that was defiled by the wicked:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> That he would have pity also upon the city that was destroyed, that was ready to be made even with the ground, and would hear the voice of the blood that cried to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> That he would remember also the most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> deaths of innocent children, and the blasphemies offered to his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and would show his indignation on this occasion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> had gathered a multitude, he could not be withstood by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was turned into mercy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So coming unawares upon the towns and cities, he set them on fire, and taking possession of the most commodious places, he made no small slaughter of the enemies:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And especially in the nights he went upon these expeditions, and the fame of his valour was spread abroad everywhere.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then Philip seeing that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gained ground by little and little, and that things for the most part succeeded prosperously with him, wrote to Ptolemee, the governor of Celesyria and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phenicia</a>, to send aid to the king's affairs. <span class="stiki"><strong>Philip seeing, etc...</strong> The governor of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> found himself unable to contend with <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, especially after the victories he had obtained over Apollonius and Seron. <a href="../douay/1ma003.htm">1 Maccabees 3</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he with all speed sent Nicanor, the son of Patroclus, one of his special friends, giving him no fewer than twenty thousand armed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of different nations, to root out the whole race of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, joining also with him Gorgias, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> soldier, and of great experience in matters of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Twenty thousand...</strong> The whole number of the forces sent at that time into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, was 40,000 footmen, and 7000 horsemen, 1 Mac. 3.30. But only 20,000 are here taken notice of, because there were no more with Nicanor at the time of the battle.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Nicanor purposed to raise for the king the tribute of two thousand talents, that was to be given to the Romans, by making so much money of the captive <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Wherefore he sent immediately to the cities upon the sea coast, to invite <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> together to buy up the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> slaves, promising that they should have ninety slaves for one talent, not reflecting on the vengeance which was to follow him from the Almighty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> found that Nicanor was coming, he imparted to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were with him, that the enemy was at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And some of them being afraid, and distrusting the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fled away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that he would deliver them from the wicked Nicanor, who had sold them before he came near them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And if not for their sakes, yet for the covenant that he had made with their fathers, and for the sake of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> that was invoked upon them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Machabeus</a> calling together seven thousand that were with him, exhorted them not to be reconciled to the enemies, nor to fear the multitude of the enemies who came wrongfully against them, but to fight manfully: <span class="stiki"><strong>Seven thousand...</strong> In the Greek it is six thousand. But then three thousand of them had no arms. <a href="../douay/1ma004.htm#verse6">1 Maccabees 4:6</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Setting before their eyes the injury they had <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> done the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, and also the injury they had done to the city, which had been shamefully abused, besides their destroying the ordinances of the fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For, said he, they trust in their weapons, and in their boldness: but we trust in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty Lord</a>, who at a beck can utterly destroy both them that come against us, and the whole world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Moreover, he put them in mind also of the helps their fathers had received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and how, under Sennacherib, a hundred and eighty-five thousand had been destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And of the battle that they had fought against the Galatians, in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>; how they, being in all but six thousand, when it came to the point, and the Macedonians, their companions, were at a stand, slew a hundred and twenty thousand, because of the help they had from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and for this they received many favours. <span class="stiki"><strong>Galatians...</strong> That is, the Gauls, who having ravaged <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, poured themselves in upon <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, in immense multitudes, where also they founded the kingdom of Galatia or Gallo Graecia.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> With these words they were greatly encouraged and disposed even to die for the laws and their country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So he appointed his brethren <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> over each division of his army; Simon, and Joseph, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, giving to each one fifteen hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And after the holy Book had been read to them by <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a>, and he had given them for a watchword, The help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: himself leading the first band, he joined battle with Nicanor:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the Almighty being their helper, they slew above nine thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and having wounded and disabled the greater part of Nicanor's army, they obliged them to fly. <span class="stiki"><strong>Above nine thousand...</strong> Viz., including the three thousand slain in the pursuit.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they took the money of them that came to buy them, and they pursued them on every side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But they came back for want of time: for it was the day before the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>: and therefore they did not continue the pursuit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But when they had gathered together their arms and their spoils, they kept the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> who had delivered them that day, distilling the beginning of mercy upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Then after the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> they divided the spoils to the feeble and the orphans, and the widows, and the rest they took for themselves and their servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> When this was done, and they had all made a common supplication, they besought the merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to be reconciled to his servants unto the end.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Moreover, they slew above twenty thousand of them that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against them, and they made themselves masters of the high strong holds: and they divided amongst them many spoils, giving equal portions to the feeble, the fatherless, and the widows; yea, and the aged also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when they had carefully gathered together their arms, they laid them all up in convenient places, and the residue of their spoils they carried to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> They slew also Philarches, who was with Timotheus, a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who had many ways afflicted the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And when they kept the feast of the victory at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fire to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gates, who had taken refuge in a certain house, rendering to him a worthy reward for his impieties:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But as for that most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Nicanor, who had brought a thousand merchants to the sale of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Being, through the help of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, brought down by them, of whom he had made no account, laying aside his garment of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, fleeing through the midland country, he came alone to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, being rendered very unhappy by the destruction of his army. <span class="stiki"><strong>Laying aside his garment of glory...</strong> That is, his splendid apparel, which he wore through ostentation; he now throws it off, lest he should be known on his flight.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he that had promised to levy the tribute for the Romans, by the means of the captives of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, now professed that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their protector, and therefore they could not be hurt, because they followed the laws appointed by him.</span></p>
