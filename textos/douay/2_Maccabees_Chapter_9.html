<h1>2 Maccabees Chapter 9</h1>
<div class="h1a">The wretched end, and fruitless repentance of King Antiochus.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> At that time Antiochus returned with dishonour out of Persia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For he had entered into the city called Persepolis, and attempted to rob the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and to oppress the city, but the multitude running together to arms, put them to flight: and so it fell out that Antiochus being put to flight, returned with disgrace. <span class="stiki"><strong>Persepolis...</strong> Otherwise called Elymais.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now when he was come about Ecbatana, he received the news of what had happened to Nicanor and Timotheus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And swelling with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, he thought to revenge upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the injury done by them that had put him to flight. And therefore he commanded his chariot to be driven, without stopping in his journey, the judgment of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> urging him forward, because he had spoken so <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a>, that he would come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and make it a common burying place of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that seeth all things, struck him with an incurable and an invisible plague. For as soon as he had ended these words, a dreadful pain in his bowels came upon him, and bitter torments of the inner parts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And indeed very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, seeing he had tormented the bowels of others with many and new torments, albeit he by no means ceased from his malice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Moreover, being filled with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, breathing out fire in his rage against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and commanding the matter to be hastened, it happened as he was going with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, that he fell from the chariot, so that his limbs were much pained by a grievous bruising of the body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thus he that seemed to himself to command even the waves of the sea, being <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> above the condition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and to weigh the heights of the mountains in a balance, now being cast down to the ground, was carried in a litter, bearing witness to the manifest power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in himself:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So that worms swarmed out of the body of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and whilst he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell off, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to the army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that thought a little before he could reach to the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could endure to carry, for the intolerable stench.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And by this means, being brought from his great <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he began to come to the knowledge of himself, being admonished by the scourge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his pains increasing every moment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when he himself could not now abide his own stench, he spoke thus: It is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> to be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that a mortal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not equal himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, of whom he was not like to obtain mercy. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of whom he was not like to obtain mercy...</strong> Because his repentance was not for the offence committed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but barely on account of his present sufferings.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the city, to which he was going in haste to lay it even with the ground, and to make it a common burying place, he now desireth to make free:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whom he said he would not account worthy to be so much as buried, but would give them up to be devoured by the birds and wild beasts, and would utterly destroy them with their children, he now promiseth to make equal with the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> also, which before he had spoiled, he promised to adorn with goodly gifts, and to multiply the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vessels, and to allow out of his revenues the charges pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Yea also, that he would become a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> himself, and would go through every place of the earth, and declare the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But his pains not ceasing, (for the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was come upon him) despairing of life, he wrote to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in the manner of a supplication, a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> in these words:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> To his very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> subjects the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Antiochus, king and ruler, wisheth much health, and welfare, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> If you and your children are well, and if all matters go with you to your mind, we give very great thanks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> As for me, being infirm, but yet kindly remembering you, returning out of the places of Persia, and being taken with a grievous disease, I thought it necessary to take care for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Not distrusting my life, but having great hope to escape the sickness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But considering that my father also, at what time he led an army into the higher countries, appointed who should reign after him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> To the end that if any thing contrary to expectation should fall out, or any bad tidings should be brought, they that were in the countries, knowing to whom the whole government was left, might not be troubled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Moreover, considering that neighbouring princes, and borderers, wait for opportunities, and expect what shall be the event, I have appointed my son, Antiochus, king, whom I often recommended to many of you, when I went into the higher provinces: and I have written to him what I have joined here below.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, therefore, and request of you, that, remembering favours both public and private, you will every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of you continue to be faithful to me and to my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For I trust that he will behave with moderation and humanity, and following my intentions, will be gracious unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Thus the murderer and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemer</a> being grievously struck, as himself had treated others, died a miserable death in a strange country, among the mountains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away his body: and out of fear of the son of Antiochus, went into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to Ptolemee Philometor.</span></p>
