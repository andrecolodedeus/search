<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> As all things of his divine power which appertain to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a> are given us through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him who hath called us by his own proper <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> By whom he hath given us most great and precious <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a>: that by these you may be made <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">partakers of the divine nature</a>: flying the corruption of that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which is in the world.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And you, employing all care, minister in your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: And in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For he that hath not these things with him is blind and groping, having forgotten that he was purged from his old <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> you may make sure your calling and <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">election</a>.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For which cause, I will begin to put you always in remembrance of these things: though indeed you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them and are confirmed in the present <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I will endeavour that you frequently have after my decease whereby you may keep a <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of these things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For we have not by following artificial fables made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you the power and presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>: but we were eyewitnesses of his <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">greatness</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And we have the more firm <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetical</a> word: whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the <a href="../cathen/09410a.htm">day star</a> arise in your hearts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Understanding this first: That no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> is made by private interpretation. <span class="stiki"><strong>No prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation...</strong> This shows plainly that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> are not to be expounded by any one's private judgment or private spirit, because every part of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">holy scriptures</a> were written by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and declared as such by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; therefore they are not to be interpreted but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, which he hath left, and <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to remain with his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to guide her in all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> came not by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at any time: but the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke, inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span></p>
