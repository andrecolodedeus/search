<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Behold this second <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> I write to you, my dearly beloved, in which, I stir up by way of admonition your sincere <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and of your <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord and Saviour</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> this first: That in the last days there shall come <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceitful</a> scoffers, walking after their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Saying: Where is his <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> or his coming? For since the time that the fathers slept, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For this they are wilfully <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of: That the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> were before, and the earth out of water and through water, consisting by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a> and perdition of the ungodly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But of this one thing be not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, my beloved, that one day with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> delayeth not his <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, as some imagine, but dealeth patiently for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that all should return to <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of the Lord</a> shall come as a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> shall pass away with great <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and the elements shall be melted with heat and the earth and the works which are in it shall be burnt up.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of people ought you to be in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> conversation and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">godliness</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of the Lord</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with the burning heat?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But we look for new <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> and a new earth according to his <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> dwelleth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And account the longsuffering of our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: as also our most dear brother <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, according to the wisdom given him, hath written to you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> As also in all his <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistles</a>, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>, to their own destruction.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> You therefore, brethren, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> these things before, take heed, lest being led aside by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the unwise, you fall from your own steadfastness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But grow in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>. To him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> both now and unto the day of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
