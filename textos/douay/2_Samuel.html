<h1>2 Samuel</h1>

<h2>The Second Book of Samuel, also called the Second Book of Kings</h2>

<p>This book relates the transactions from the death of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> until the end of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> reign, being a history for the space of about forty-six years. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08647b.htm">FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/2sa001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> David mourneth for the death of Saul and Jonathan: he ordereth the man to be slain who pretended he had killed Saul.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> David is received and anointed king of Juda. Isboseth the son of Saul reigneth over the rest of Israel. A battle between Abner and Joab.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> David groweth daily stronger. Abner cometh over to him: he is treacherously slain by Joab.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Isboseth is murdered by two of his servants. David punisheth the murderers.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> David is anointed king of all Israel. He taketh Jerusalem, and dwelleth there. He defeateth the Philistines.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> David fetcheth the ark from Cariathiarim. Oza is struck dead for touching it. It is deposited in the house of Obededom: and from thence carried to David's house.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> David's purpose to build a temple is rewarded with the promise of great blessings in his seed: his prayer and thanksgiving.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> David's victories, and his chief officers.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> David's kindness to Miphiboseth for the sake of his father Jonathan.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> The Ammonites shamefully abuse the ambassadors of David: they hire the Syrians to the their assistance: but are overthrown with their allies.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> David falleth into the crime of adultery with Bethsabee: and not finding other means to conceal it, causeth her husband Urias to be slain. Then marrieth her, who beareth him a son.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> Nathan's parable. David confesseth his sin, and is forgiven: yet so as to be sentenced to most severe temporal punishments. The death of the child. The birth of Solomon. The taking of Rabbath.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> Ammon ravisheth Thamar. For which Absalom killeth him, and flieth to Gessur.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> Joab procureth Absalom's return, and his admittance to the king's presence.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> Absalom's policy and conspiracy. David is obliged to flee.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> Siba bringeth provisions to David. Semei curseth him. Absalom defileth his father's wives.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> Achitophel's counsel is defeated by Chusai: who sendeth intelligence to David. Achitophel hangeth himself.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> Absalom is defeated, and slain by Joab. David mourneth for him.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> David, at the remonstrances of Joab, ceaseth his mourning. He is invited back and met by Semei and Miphiboseth: a strife between the men of Juda and the men of Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> Seba's rebellion. Amasa is slain by Joab. Abela is besieged, but upon the citizens casting over the wall the head of Seba, Joab departeth with all his army.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> A famine of three years, for the sin of Saul against the Gabaonites, at whose desire seven of Saul's race are crucified. War again with the Philistines.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> King David's psalm of thanksgiving for his deliverance from all his enemies.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa023.htm"><strong>Chapter 23.</strong></a> The last words of David. A catalogue of his valiant men.
<br><a href="../douay/2sa024.htm"><strong>Chapter 24.</strong></a> David numbereth the people: God sendeth a pestilence, which is stopt by David's prayer and sacrifice.
