<div class="h1a">David mourns for the death of Saul and Jonathan: he orders the man to be slain who pretended he had killed Saul.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now it came to pass, after <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was dead, that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> returned from the slaughter of the <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecites</a>, and abode two days in Siceleg.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And on the third day, there appeared a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who came out of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> camp, with his garments rent, and dust strewed on his head: and when he came to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, he fell upon his face, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: From whence comest thou? And he said to him: I am fled out of the camp of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said unto him: What is the matter that is come to pass? tell me: He said: The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people are fallen and dead: moreover <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son are slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to the young man that told him: How knowest thou that <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son, are dead?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the young man that told him, said: I came by chance upon mount Gelboe, and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> leaned upon his spear: and the chariots and horsemen drew nigh unto him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And looking behind him, and seeing me, he called me. And I answered, Here am I.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he said to me: Who art thou? And I said to him: I am an <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecite</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to me: Stand over me, and kill me: for anguish is come upon me, and as yet my whole life is in me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So standing over him, I killed him: for I knew that he could not live after the fall: and I took the diadem that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to thee, my lord. <span class="stiki"><strong>I killed him...</strong> This story of the young <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecite</a> was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as may easily be proved by comparing it with <a href="../douay/1sa031.htm">1 Samuel 31</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> took hold of his garments and rent them, and likewise all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they mourned, and wept, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> until evening for <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and for <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son, and for the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, because they were fallen by the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to the young man that told him: Whence art thou? He answered: I am the son of a stranger of <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: Why didst thou not fear to put out thy hand to kill the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> calling one of his servants, said: Go near and fall upon him. And he struck him so that he died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: Thy blood be upon thy own head: for thy own mouth hath spoken against thee, saying: I have slain the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> made this kind of lamentation over <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and over <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> (Also he commanded that they should teach the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> the use of the bow, as it is written in the book of the just.) And he said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Consider, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for them that are dead, wounded on thy high places.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The illustrious of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> are slain upon thy mountains: how are the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> fallen?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Tell it not in Geth, publish it not in the streets of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>: lest the daughters of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span></blockquote>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, lovely, and comely in their life, even in death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.</span></blockquote>
