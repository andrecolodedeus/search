<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that the king of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> died, and Hanon his son reigned in his stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: I will show kindness to Hanon the son of Daas, as his father showed kindness to me. So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent his servants to comfort him for the death of his father. But when the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> were come into the land of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The princes of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> said to Hanon their lord: Thinkest thou that for the honour of thy father, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> hath sent comforters to thee, and hath not <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> rather sent his servants to thee to search, and spy into the city, and overthrow it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Wherefore Hanon took the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and shaved off the one half of their <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beards</a>, and cut away half of their garments even to the buttocks, and sent them away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> When this was told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, he sent to meet them: for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were sadly put to confusion, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> commanded them, saying: Stay at <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, till your <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beards</a> be grown, and then return.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> seeing that they had done an injury to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, sent and hired the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> of Rohob, and the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> of Soba, twenty thousand footmen, and of the king of Maacha a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and of Istob twelve thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> heard this, he sent Joab and the whole army of warriors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> came out, and set their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in array at the entering in of the gate: but the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> of Soba, and of Rohob, and of Istob, and of Maacha were by themselves in the field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then Joab seeing that the battle was prepared against him, both before and behind, chose of all the choice <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and put them in array against the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the rest of the people he delivered to <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a> his brother, who set them in array against the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Joab said: If the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> are too strong for me, then thou shalt help me, but if the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> are too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and let us fight for our people, and for the city of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will do what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in his sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Joab and the people that were with him, began to fight against the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>: and they immediately fled before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> seeing that the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> were fled, they fled also before <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a>, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> seeing that they had fallen before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, gathered themselves together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Adarezer sent and fetched the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, that were beyond the river, and brought over their army: and Sobach, the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the host of Adarezer, was their general.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when this was told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, he gathered all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> together, and passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and came to Helam: and the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> set themselves in array against <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and fought against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> fled before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slew of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen: and smote Sobach the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the army, who presently died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And all the kings that were auxiliaries of Adarezer, seeing themselves overcome by <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, were afraid and fled away, eight and fifty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And they made peace with <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and served them, and all the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> were afraid to help the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> any more.</span></p>
