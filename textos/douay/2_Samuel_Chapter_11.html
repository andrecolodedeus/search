<h1>2 Samuel Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">David falls into the crime of adultery with Bethsabee: and not finding other means to conceal it, causes her husband Urias to be slain. Then marries her, who bears him a son.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the time when kings go forth to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent Joab and his servants with him, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they spoiled the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and besieged Rabba: but <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> remained in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> In the mean time it happened that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose from his bed after noon, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: And he saw from the roof of his house a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> washing herself, over against him: and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was very beautiful.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king sent, and inquired who the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was. And it was told him, that she was Bethsabee the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Urias the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent messengers, and took her, and she came in to him, and he slept with her: and presently she was purified from her <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And she returned to her house having conceived. And she sent and told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and said: I have conceived.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent to Joab, saying: Send me Urias the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>. And Joab sent Urias to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Urias came to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> asked how Joab did, and the people, and how the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was carried on.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Urias: Go into thy house, and <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash thy feet</a>. And Urias went out from the king's house, and there went out after him a mess of meat from the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But Urias slept before the gate of the king's house, with the other servants of his lord, and went not down to his own house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> by some that said: Urias went not to his house. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Urias: Didst thou not come from thy journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Urias said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: The <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> dwell in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord abide upon the face of the earth: and shall I go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to sleep with my wife? By thy welfare and by the welfare of thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> I will not do this thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Urias: Tarry here to day, and tomorrow I will send thee away. Urias tarried in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> that day and the next.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> called him to eat and to drink before him, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening, and slept on his couch with the servants of his lord, and went not down into his house.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when the morning was come, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> wrote a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> to Joab: and sent it by the hand of Urias,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Writing in the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>: Set ye Urias in the front of the battle, where the fight is strongest: and leave ye him, that he may be wounded and die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Wherefore as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in the place where he knew the bravest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> coming out of the city, fought against Joab, and there fell some of the people of the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and Urias the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a> was killed also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then Joab sent, and told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> all things concerning the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he charged the messenger, saying: When thou hast told all the words of the battle to the king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> If thou see him to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and he shall say: Why did you approach so near to the wall to fight? knew you not that many darts are thrown from above off the wall?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Who killed Abimelech the son of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>? did not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall and slew him in Thebes? Why did you go near the wall? Thou shalt say: Thy servant Urias the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a> is also slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So the messenger departed, and came and told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> all that Joab had commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the messenger said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> prevailed against us, and they came out to us into the field: and we vigorously charged and pursued them even to the gate of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants from off the wall above: and some of the king's servants are slain, and thy servant Urias the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a> is also dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to the messenger: Thus shalt thou say to Joab: Let not this thing discourage thee: for various is the event of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and sometimes one, sometimes another is consumed by the sword: encourage thy warriors against the city, and exhort them that thou mayest overthrow it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the mourning being over, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent and brought her into his house, and she became his wife, and she bore him a son: and this thing which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had done, was displeasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
