<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had exceeding many sheep and oxen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had nothing at all but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and which had grown up in his house together with his children, eating of his bread, and drinking of his cup, and sleeping in his bosom: and it was unto him as a daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when a certain stranger was come to the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he spared to take of his own sheep and oxen, to make a feast for that stranger, who was come to him, but took the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ewe, and dressed it for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was come to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> being exceedingly kindled against that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he said to <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a>: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that hath done this is a child of death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He shall restore the ewe fourfold, because he did this thing, and had no pity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thou art the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and if these things be little, I shall add far greater things unto thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Why therefore hast thou <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in my sight? Thou hast killed Urias the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a> with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> me, and hast taken the wife of Urias the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a> to be thy wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold, I will raise up <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes and give them to thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. <span class="stiki"><strong>I will raise, etc...</strong> All these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, inasmuch as they were punishments, came upon <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> says, I will raise, etc.; but inasmuch as they were <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, on the part of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> and his associates, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was not the author of them, but only permitted them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and in the sight of the sun.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a>: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also hath taken away thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: thou shalt not die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Nevertheless, because thou hast given occasion to the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>, for this thing, the child that is born to thee, shall surely die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> returned to his house. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also struck the child which the wife of Urias had borne to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and his life was despaired of.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> besought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for the child: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> kept a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>, and going in by himself lay upon the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the ancients of his house came, to make him rise from the ground: but he would not, neither did he eat meat with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died: and the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> feared to tell him, that the child was dead. For they said: Behold when the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how much more will he afflict himself if we tell him that the child is dead?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> saw his servants whispering, he understood that the child was dead: and he said to his servants: Is the child dead? They answered him He is dead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose from the ground, and washed and anointed himself: and when he had changed his apparel, he went into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and worshipped, and then he came into his own house, and he called for bread, and ate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And his servants said to him: What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive, but when the child was dead, thou didst rise up, and eat bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said: While the child was yet alive, I <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> and wept for him: for I said: Who knoweth whether the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may not give him to me, and the child may live?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Shall I be able to bring him back any more? I shall go to him rather: but he shall not return to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> comforted Bethsabee his wife, and went in unto her, and slept with her: and she bore a son, and he called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he sent by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan the prophet</a>, and called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, Amiable to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Amiable to the Lord...</strong> Or, beloved of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, Jedidiah.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And Joab fought against Rabbath of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and laid close siege to the royal city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Joab sent messengers to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: I have fought against Rabbath, and the city of waters is about to be taken. <span class="stiki"><strong>The city of waters...</strong> Rabbath the royal city of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>, was called the city of waters, from being encompassed with waters.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Now therefore gather thou the rest of the people together, and besiege the city and take it: lest when the city shall be wasted by me, the victory be ascribed to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> gathered all the people together, and went out against Rabbath: and after fighting, he took it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he took the crown of their king from his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold, set with <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">most precious stones</a>, and it was put upon <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> head, and the spoils of the city which were very great he carried away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And bringing forth the people thereof he sawed them, and drove over them chariots armed with iron: and divided them with knives, and made them pass through brickkilns: so did he to all the cities of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> returned, with all the army to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
