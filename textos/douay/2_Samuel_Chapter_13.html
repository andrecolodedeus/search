<div class="h1a">Ammon ravishes Thamar. For which Absalom kills him, and flies to Gessur.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass after this that Ammon the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the sister of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, who was very beautiful, and her <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Thamar.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he was exceedingly fond of her, so that he fell sick for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of her: for as she was a virgin, he thought it hard to do any thing dishonestly with her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now Ammon had a friend, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Jonadab the son of Semmaa the brother of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, a very wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>A very wise man...</strong> That is, a crafty and subtle <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for the counsel he gave on this occasion shows that his wisdom was but carnal and worldly.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he said to him: Why dost thou grow so lean from day to day, O son of the king? why dost thou not tell me the reason of it? And Ammon said to him: I am in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with Thamar the sister of my brother <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Jonadab said to him: Lie down upon thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father shall come to visit thee, say to him: Let my sister Thamar, I pray thee, come to me, to give me to eat, and to make me a mess, that I may eat it at her hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So Ammon lay down, and made as if he were sick: and when the king came to visit him, Ammon said to the king: I pray thee let my sister Thamar come, and make in my sight two little messes, that I may eat at her hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent home to Thamar, saying: Come to the house of thy brother Ammon, and make him a mess.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Thamar came to the house of Ammon her brother: but he was laid down: and she took meal and tempered it: and dissolving it in his sight she made little messes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And taking what she had boiled, she poured it out, and set it before him, but he would not eat: and Ammon said: Put out all persons from me. And when they had put all persons out,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Ammon said to Thamar: Bring the mess into the chamber, that I may eat at thy hand. And Thamar took the little messes which she had made, and brought them in to her brother Ammon in the chamber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when she had presented him the meat, he took hold of her, and said: Come lie with me, my sister.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> She answered him: Do not so, my brother, do not force me: for no such thing must be done in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Do not thou this folly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For I shall not be able to bear my shame, and thou shalt be as one of the fools in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: but rather speak to the king, and he will not deny me to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But he would not hearken to her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but being stronger overpowered her and lay with her.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then Ammon <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> her with an exceeding great <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>: so that the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> wherewith he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> her was greater than the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with which he had <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> her before. And Ammon said to her: Arise, and get thee gone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> She answered him: The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which now thou dost against me, in driving me away, is greater than that which thou didst before. And he would not hearken to her:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But calling the servants that ministered to him, he said: Thrust this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> out from me: and shut the door after her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And she was clothed with a long robe: for the king's daughters that were virgins, used such kind of garments. Then his servant thrust her out: and shut the door after her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And she put ashes on her head, and rent her long robe and laid her hands upon her head, and went on crying.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> her brother said to her: Hath thy brother Ammon lain with thee? but now, sister, hold thy peace, he is thy brother: and afflict not thy heart for this thing. So Thamar remained pining away in the house of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> her brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> heard of these things he was exceedingly grieved: and he would not afflict the spirit of his son Ammon, for he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him, because he was his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> spoke not to Ammon neither <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Ammon because he had ravished his sister Thamar.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And it came to pass after two years, that the sheep of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> were shorn in Baalhasor, which is near Ephraim: and <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> invited all the king's sons:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he came to the king, and said to him: Behold thy servant's sheep are shorn. Let the king, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, with his servants come to his servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the king said to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: Nay, my son, do not ask that we should all come, and be chargeable to thee. And when he pressed him, and he would not go, he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> said: If thou wilt not come, at least let my brother Ammon, I beseech thee, come with us. And the king said to him: It is not necessary that he should go with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> pressed him, so that he let Ammon and all the king's sons go with him. And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> made a feast as it were the feast of a king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> had commanded his servants, saying: Take notice when Ammon shall be drunk with wine, and when I shall say to you: Strike him, and kill him, fear not: for it is I that command you: take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the servants of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> did to Ammon as <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> had commanded them. And all the king's sons arose and got up every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> upon his mule, and fled.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And while they were yet in the way, a rumour came to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one them left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then the king rose up, and rent his garments: and fell upon the ground, and all his servants, that stood about him, rent their garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But Jonadab the son of Semmaa <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> brother answering, said: Let not my lord the king think that all the king's sons are slain: Ammon only is dead, for he was appointed by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> from the day that he ravished his sister Thamar.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Now therefore let not my lord the king take this thing into his heart, saying: All the king's sons are slain: for Ammon only is dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> fled away: and the young man that kept the watch, lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold there came much people by a by-way on the side of the mountain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And Jonadab said to the king: Behold the king's sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And when he made an end of speaking, the king's sons also appeared: and coming in they lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> fled, and went to Tholomai the son of Ammiud the king of Gessur. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> mourned for his son every day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> after he was fled, and come into Gessur, was there three years. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> ceased to pursue after <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, because he was comforted concerning the death of Ammon.</span></p>
