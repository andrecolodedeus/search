<div class="h1a">Joab procures Absalom's return, and his admittance to the king's presence.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Joab the son of Sarvia, understanding that the king's heart was turned to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Sent to Thecua, and fetched from thence a wise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: and said to her: Feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, and be not anointed with oil, that thou mayest be as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that had a long time been mourning for one dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt go in to the king, and shalt speak to him in this manner. And Joab put the words in her mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Thecua was come in to the king, she fell before him upon the ground, and worshipped, and said: Save me, O king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the king said to her: What is the matter with thee? She answered: Alas, I am a widow <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: for my husband is dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And thy handmaid had two sons: and they quarrelled with each other in the field, and there was none to part them: and the one struck the other, and slew him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And behold the whole kindred rising against thy handmaid, saith: Deliver him that hath slain his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother, whom he slew, and that we may destroy the heir: and they seek to quench my spark which is left, and will leave my husband no <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, nor remainder upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the king said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Thecua said to the king: Upon me, my lord be the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and upon the house of my father: but may the king and his throne be guiltless.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the king said: If any one shall say ought against thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And she said: Let the king remember the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the next of kin be not multiplied to take revenge, and that they may not kill my son. And he said: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said: Let thy hand maid speak one word to my lord the king. And he said: Speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said: Why hast thou thought such a thing against the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and why hath the king spoken this word, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and not bring home again his own exile?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> We all die, and like waters that return no more, we fall down into the earth: neither will <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> have a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to perish, but recalleth, meaning that he that is cast off should not altogether perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now therefore I am come, to speak this word to my lord the king before the people. And thy handmaid said: I will speak to the king, it maybe the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the king hath hearkened to me to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of all that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then let thy handmaid say, that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> the king be made as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. For even as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>, so is my lord the king, that he is neither moved with <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> nor <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursing</a>: wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> is also with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the king answering, said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: Hide not from me the thing that I ask thee. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to him: Speak, my lord the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the king said: Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> answered, and said: By the health of thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, my lord, O king, it is neither on the left hand, nor on the right, in all these things which my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he commanded me, and he put all these words into the mouth of thy handmaid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> That I should come about with this form of speech, thy servant Joab commanded this: but thou, my lord, O king, art wise, according to the wisdom of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>, to understand all things upon earth.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the king said to Joab: Behold I am appeased and have granted thy request: Go therefore and fetch back the boy <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Joab falling down to the ground upon his face, <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the king: and Joab said: This day thy servant hath understood, that I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in thy sight, my lord, O king: for thou hast fulfilled the request of thy servant. <span class="stiki"><strong>Blessed...</strong> That is, and gave thanks to the king.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then Joab arose and went to Gessur, and brought <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But the king said: Let him return into his house, and let him not see my face. So <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> returned into his house, and saw not the king's face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But in all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> there was not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so comely, and so exceedingly beautiful as <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: from the sole of the foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when he polled his hair (now he was polled once a year, because his hair was burdensome to him) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred sicles, according to the common weight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And there were born to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> three sons: and one daughter, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Thamar, and she was very beautiful.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> dwelt two years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and saw not the king's face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> He sent therefore to Joab, to send him to the king: but he would not come to him. And when he had sent the second time, and he would not come to him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> He said to his servants: You know the field of Joab near my field, that hath a crop of barley: go now and set it on fire. So the servants of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> set the corn on fire. And Joab's servants coming with their garments rent, said: The servants of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> have set part of the field on fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then Joab arose, and came to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> to his house, and said: Why have thy servants set my corn on fire?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> answered Joab: I sent to thee beseeching thee to come to me, that I might send thee to the king, to say to him: Wherefore am I come from Gessur? it had been better for me to be there: I beseech thee therefore that I may see the face of the king: and if he be mindful of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, let him kill me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> So Joab going in to the king, told him all: and <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> was called for, and, he went in to the king: and prostrated himself on the ground before him: and the king <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span></p>
