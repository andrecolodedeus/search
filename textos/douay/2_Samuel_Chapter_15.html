<div class="h1a">Absalom's policy and conspiracy. David is obliged to flee.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now after these things <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> made himself chariots, and horsemen, and fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to run before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> rising up early stood by the entrance of the gate, and when any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had business to come to the king's judgment, <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> called him to him, and said: Of what city art thou? He answered, and said: Thy servant is of such <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribe of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> answered him: Thy words seem to me <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>. But there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> appointed by the king to hear thee. And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> O that they would make me judge over the land, that all that have business might come to me, that I might do them <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Moreover when any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> came to him to salute him, he put forth his hand, and took him, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And this he did to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that came for judgment, to be heard by the king, and he enticed the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And after forty years, <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>: Let me go, and pay my <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> which I have <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For thy servant made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, when he was in Gessur of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, saying: If the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall bring me again into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, I will offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> said to him: Go in peace. And he arose, and went to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> sent spies into all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, saying: As soon as you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, say ye: <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> reigneth in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now there went with <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> two hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> that were called, going with simplicity of heart, and knowing nothing of the design.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> also sent for <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel the Gilonite</a>, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> counsellor, from his city Gilo. And while he was <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, there was a strong conspiracy, and the people running together increased with <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And there came a messenger to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: All <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with their whole heart followeth <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to his servants, that were with him in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: Arise and let us flee: for we shall not escape else from the face of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: make haste to go out, lest he come and overtake us, and bring ruin upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the king's servants said to him: Whatsoever our lord the king shall command, we thy servants will willingly execute.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the king went forth, and all his household on foot: and the king left ten <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a> to keep the house: <span class="stiki"><strong>Concubines...</strong> That is, wives of an inferior degree.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the king going forth and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> on foot, stood afar off from the house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And all his servants walked by him, and the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and all the Gethites, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> warriors, six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who had followed him from Geth on foot, went before the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the king said to Ethai the Gethite: Why comest thou with us: return and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and art come out of thy own place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Yesterday thou camest, and to day shalt thou be forced to go forth with us? but I shall go whither I am going: return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will show thee mercy, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because thou hast shown <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and fidelity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Ethai answered the king, saying: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, and as my lord the king liveth: in what place soever thou shalt be, my lord, O king, either in death, or in life, there will thy servant be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Ethai: Come, and pass over. And Ethai the Gethite passed, and all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, and the rest of the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they all wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself went over the <a href="../cathen/03475c.htm">brook Cedron</a>, and all the people marched towards the way that looketh to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Sadoc the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> also came, and all the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> with him carrying the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of God</a>, and they set down the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> went up, till all the people that was come out of the city had done passing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the king said to Sadoc: Carry back the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> into the city: if I shall find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he will bring me again, and he will show me it, and his <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But if he shall say to me: Thou pleasest me not: I am ready, let him do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the king said to Sadoc the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: O seer, return into the city in peace: and let <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas</a> thy son, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, your two sons, be with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Behold I will lie hid in the plains of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, till there come word from you to certify me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So Sadoc and <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> carried back the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and they tarried there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went up by the ascent of <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount Olivet</a>, going up and weeping, walking barefoot, and with his head covered, and all the people that were with them, went up with their heads covered weeping. <span class="stiki"><strong>Weeping, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> on this occasion wept for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which he knew were the cause of all his sufferings.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> that <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> also was in the conspiracy with <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: Infatuate, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, I beseech thee, the counsel of <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was come to the top of the mountain, where he was about to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, behold <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai the Arachite</a>, came to meet him with his garment rent and his head covered with earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: If thou come with me, thou wilt be a burden to me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But if thou return into the city, and wilt say to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: I am thy servant, O king: as I have been thy father's servant, so I will be thy servant: thou shalt defeat the counsel of <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And thou hast with thee Sadoc, and soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Sadoc and <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And there are with them their two sons <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas, the son of Sadoc</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>: and you shall send by them to me every thing that you shall hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Then <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> the friend of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went into the city, and <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> came into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
