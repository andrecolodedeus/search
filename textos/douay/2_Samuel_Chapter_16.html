<h1>2 Samuel Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">Siba brings provisions to David. Semei curses him. Absalom defiles his father's wives.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was a little past the top of the hill, behold Siba the servant of Miphiboseth came to meet him with two asses, laden with two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a vessel of wine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the king said to Siba: What mean these things? And Siba answered: The asses are for the king's household to sit on: and the loaves and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine to drink if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be faint in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king said: Where is thy master's son? And Siba answered the king: He remained in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying: To day, will the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> restore me the kingdom of my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king said to Siba: I give thee all that belonged to Miphiboseth. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before thee, my lord, O king.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> came as far as Bahurim: and behold there came out from thence a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the kindred of the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> as he went on,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">threw stones</a> at <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and at all the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>: and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the right, and on the left side of the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And thus said Semei when he <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> the king: Come out, come out, thou <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of blood, and thou <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given the kingdom into the hand of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> thy son: and behold thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> press upon thee, because thou art a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai the son of Sarvia</a> said to the king: Why should this dead dog <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> my lord the king? I will go, and cut off his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the king said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? Let him alone and let him <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath bid him <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done so? <span class="stiki"><strong>Hath bid him curse...</strong> Not that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was the author of Semei's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which proceeded purely from his own <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and the abuse of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. But that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, and suffering his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malicious</a> disposition to break out on this occasion, he made use of him as his instrument to punish <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the king said to <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a>, and to all his servants: Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now a son of Jemini? let him alone that he may <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath bidden him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Perhaps the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may look upon my affliction, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may render me <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursing</a> of this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him went by the way. And Semei by the hill's side went over against him, <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursing</a>, and casting stones at him, and scattering earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the king and all the people with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> and all his people came into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> was with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai the Arachite</a>, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> friend, was come to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, he said to him: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save thee, O king, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save thee, O king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> said to him, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> answered <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: Nay: for I will be his, whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath chosen, and all this people, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and with him will I abide.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king's son? as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a>: Consult what we are to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: Go in to the <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a> of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may be strengthened with thee. <span class="stiki"><strong>Their hands may be strengthened, etc...</strong> The people might apprehend lest <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> should be reconciled to his father, and therefore they followed him with some fear of being left in the lurch, till they saw such a crime committed as seemed to make a reconciliation impossible.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So they spread a tent for <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> on the top of the house, and he went in to his father's <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a> before all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now the counsel of <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a>, which he gave in those days, was as if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should consult <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so was all the counsel of <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a>, both when he was with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and when he was with <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span></p>
