<div class="h1a">Achitophel's counsel is defeated by Chusai: who sends intelligence to David. Achitophel hangs himself.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: I will choose me twelve thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and I will arise and pursue after <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> this night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And coming upon him (for he is now weary, and weak handed) I will defeat him: and when all the people is put to flight that is with him, I will kill the king who will be left alone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I will bring back all the people, as if they were but one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for thou seekest but one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and all the people shall be in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And his saying pleased <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, and all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> said: Call <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai the Arachite</a>, and let us hear what he also saith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> was come to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> said to him: <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> hath spoken after this manner: shall we do it or not? what counsel dost thou give?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: The counsel that <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> hath given this time is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And again <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> said: Thou knowest thy father, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are with him, that they are very <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a>, and bitter in their mind, as a bear raging in the wood when her whelps are taken away: and thy father is a warrior, and will not lodge with the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Perhaps he now lieth hid in pits, or in some other place where he liest: and when any one shall fall at the first, every one that heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the people that followed <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall melt for fear: for all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> know thy father to be a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that all who are with him are <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But this seemeth to me to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> counsel: Let all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> be gathered to thee, from <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a> to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>, as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered: and thou shalt be in the midst of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And we shall come upon him in what place soever he shall be found: and we shall cover him, as the dew falleth upon the ground, and we shall not leave of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are with him, not so much as one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And if he shall enter into any city, all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall cast ropes round about that city, and we will draw it into the river, so that there shall not be found so much as one small stone thereof.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said: The counsel of <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai the Arachite</a> is better than the counsel of <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a>: and by the will of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the profitable counsel of <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> was defeated, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> might bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> said to Sadoc and <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: Thus and thus did <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> counsel <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, and the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and thus and thus did I counsel them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now therefore send quickly, and tell <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: Tarry not this night in the plains of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, but without delay pass over: lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that is with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> and <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas</a> stayed by the fountain Rogel: and there went a maid and told them: and they went forward, to carry the message to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, for they might not be seen, nor enter into the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But a certain boy saw them, and told <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: but they making haste went into the house of a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in Bahurim, who had a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and they went down into it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> took, and spread a covering over the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>, as it were to dry sodden barley and so the thing was not known.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom's</a> servants were come into the house, they said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: Where is <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>? and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> answered them: They passed on in haste, after they had tasted a little water. But they that sought them, when they found them not, returned into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when they were gone, they came up out of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>, and going on told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, and said: Arise, and pass quickly over the river: for this manner of counsel has <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> given against you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, until it grew light, and not one of them was left that was not gone ever the river.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But <a href="../cathen/01102e.htm">Achitophel</a> seeing that his counsel was not followed, saddled his ass, and arose and went home to his house and to his city, and putting his house in order, hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> came to the camp, and <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, he and all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with him. <span class="stiki"><strong>To the camp...</strong> The city of Mahanaim, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of which, in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, signifies <em>The camp</em>. It was a city of note at that time, as appears from its having been chosen by Isboseth for the place of his residence.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Now <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> appointed Amasa in Joab's stead over the army: and Amasa was the son of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was called Jethra, of Jezrael, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Naas, the sister of Sarvia who was the mother of Joab.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> camped with <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> in the land of Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was come to the camp, Sobi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and Machir the son of Ammihel of Lodabar and Berzellai the Galaadite of Rogelim,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Brought him beds, and <a href="../cathen/14449b.htm">tapestry</a>, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and fried pulse,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And honey, and butter, and sheep, and fat calves, and they gave to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and the people that were with him, to eat: for they suspected that the people were faint with hunger and thirst in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span></p>
