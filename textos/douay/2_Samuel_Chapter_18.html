<h1>2 Samuel Chapter 18</h1>
<div class="h1a">Absalom is defeated, and slain by Joab. David mourns for him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, having reviewed his people, appointed over them <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of thousands and of <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">hundreds</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai the son of Sarvia Joab's brother</a>, and a third part under the hand of Ethai, who was of Geth: and the king said to the people: I also will go forth with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the people answered: Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not much mind us: or if half of us should fall, they will not greatly care: for thou alone art accounted for ten thousand: it is better therefore that thou shouldst be in the city to succour us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king said to them: What seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to you, that will I do. And the king stood by the gate: and all the people went forth by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the king commanded Joab, and <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a>, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>. And all the people heard the king giving charge to all the princes concerning <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So the people went out into the field against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were defeated there by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> army, and a great slaughter was made that day of twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country, and there were many more of the people whom the forest consumed, than whom the sword devoured that day. <span class="stiki"><strong>Consumed...</strong> Viz., by pits and precipices.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And it happened that <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> met the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, riding on a mule: and as the mule went under a thick and large oak, his head stuck in the oak: and while he hung between the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth, the mule on which he rode passed on.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And one saw this and told Joab, saying: I saw <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> hanging upon an oak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Joab said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that told him: If thou sawest him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have given thee ten sicles of silver, and a belt?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said to Joab: If thou wouldst have paid down in my hands a thousand pieces of silver, I would not lay my hands upon the king's son for in our hearing the king charged thee, and <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a>, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Yea and if I should have acted boldly against my own life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou have stood by me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Joab said: Not as thou wilt, but I will set upon him in thy sight. So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: and whilst he yet panted for life, sticking on the oak,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Ten young men, armourbearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him slew him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people from pursuing after <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in their flight, being willing to spare the multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they took <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and they laid an exceeding great heap of stones upon him: but all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> fled to their own dwellings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Now <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> had reared up for himself, in his lifetime, a pillar, which is in the king's valley: for he said: I have no son, and this shall be the monument of my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>. And he called the pillar by his own <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and it is called the hand of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, to this day. <span class="stiki"><strong>No son...</strong> The sons mentioned above, <a href="../douay/2sa014.htm#verse27">2 Samuel 14:27</a>, were dead when this pillar was erected: unless we suppose he raised this pillar before they were born.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas the son of Sadoc</a> said: I will run and tell the king, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath done judgment for him from the hand of his enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Joab said to him: Thou shalt not be the messenger this day, but shalt bear tidings another day: this day I will not have thee bear tidings, because the king's son is dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Joab said to <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a>: Go, and tell the king what thou hast seen. <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> bowed down to Joab, and ran.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas the son of Sadoc</a> said to Joab again: Why might not I also run after <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a>? And Joab said to him: Why wilt thou run, my son? thou wilt not be the bearer of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tidings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run. Then <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas</a> running by a nearer way passed <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sat between the two gates: and the watchman that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> running alone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And crying out he told the king: and the king said: If he be alone, there are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tidings in his mouth. And as he was coming apace, and drawing nearer,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> The watchman saw another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> running, and crying aloud from above, he said: I see another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> running alone. And the king said: He also is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> messenger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the watchman said: The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas the son of Sadoc</a>. And the king said: He is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and cometh with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> news.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas</a> crying out, said to the king: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save thee, O king. And falling down before the king with his face to the ground, he said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, who hath shut up the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that have lifted up their hands against the lord my king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the king said: Is the young man <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> safe? And <a href="../cathen/01102c.htm">Achimaas</a> said: I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab sent me thy servant: I know nothing else.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the king said to him: Pass, and stand here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when he had passed, and stood still, <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> appeared and coming up he said: I bring <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tidings, my lord, the king, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all that have risen up against thee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the king said to <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a>: Is the young man <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> safe? And <a href="../cathen/03765a.htm">Chusai</a> answering him, said: Let the enemies of my lord, the king, and all that rise against him unto <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, be as the young man is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went he spoke in this manner: My son <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> my son: would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that I might die for thee, <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> my son, my son <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Would to God...</strong> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> lamented the death of <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, because of the wretched state in which he died: and therefore would have been glad to have saved his life, even by dying for him. In which he was a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> weeping, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and dying for his rebellious children, and even for them that crucified him.</span></span></p>
