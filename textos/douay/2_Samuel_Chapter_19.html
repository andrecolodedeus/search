<h1>2 Samuel Chapter 19</h1>
<div class="h1a">David, at the remonstrances of Joab, ceases his mourning. He is invited back and met by Semei and Miphiboseth: a strife between the men of Judah and the men of Israel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it was told Joab, that the king wept and mourned for his son:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day: The king grieveth for his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the people shunned the going into the city that day as a people would do that hath turned their backs, and fled away from the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king covered his head, and cried with a loud voice: O my son <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, O <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> my son, O my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then Joab going into the house to the king, said: Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, that have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thou <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thee, and thou <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatest</a> them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thee: and thou hast shown this day that thou carest not for thy nobles, nor for thy servants: and I now plainly perceive that if <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> had lived, and all we had been slain, then it would have pleased thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now therefore arise, and go out, and speak to the satisfaction of thy servants: for I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to thee by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that if thou wilt not go forth, there will not tarry with thee so much as one this night: and that will be worse to thee, than all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that have befallen thee from thy youth until now.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then the king arose and sat in the gate: and it was told to all the people that the king sat in the gate: and all the people came before the king, but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> fled to their own dwellings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And all the people were at strife in all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, saying: The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and now he is fled out of the land for <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, whom we anointed over us, is dead in the battle: how long are you silent, and bring not back the king?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> sent to Sadoc, and <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, saying: Speak to the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saying: Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? (For the talk of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was come to the king in his house.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> You are my brethren, you are my bone, and my flesh, why are you the last to bring back the king?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And say ye to Amasa: Art not thou my bone, and my flesh? So do <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to me and add more, if thou be not the chief <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the army before me always in the place of Joab.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he inclined the heart of all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, as it were of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and they sent to the king, saying: Return thou, and all thy servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the king returned and came as far as the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> came as far as Galgal to meet the king, and to bring him over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim, made haste and went down with the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> to meet <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> With a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and Siba the servant of the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and his fifteen sons, and twenty servants were with him: and going over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> They passed the fords before the king, that they might help over the king's household, and do according to his commandment. And Semei the son of Gera falling down before the king, when he was come over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Said to him: Impute not to me, my lord, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, nor remember the injuries of thy servant on the day that thou, my lord, the king, wentest out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, nor lay it up in thy heart, O king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For I thy servant acknowledge my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and therefore I am come this day the first of all the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">house of Joseph</a>, and am come down to meet my lord the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai the son of Sarvia</a> answering, said: Shall Semei for these words not be put to death, because he <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> anointed?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? why are you a satan this day to me? shall there any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be killed this day in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? do not I know that this day I am made king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the king said to Semei: Thou shalt not die. And he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> unto him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Miphiboseth the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> came down to meet the king, and he had neither <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed his feet</a>, nor trimmed his <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>: nor washed his garments from the day that the king went out, until the day of his return in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when he met the king at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the king said to him: Why camest thou not with me, Miphiboseth?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he answering, said: My lord, O king, my servant <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> me: for I thy servant spoke to him to saddle me an ass, that I might get on and go with the king: for I thy servant am lame.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Moreover he hath also accused me thy servant to thee, my lord the king: but thou my lord the king art as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>, do what pleaseth thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For all of my father's house were no better than worthy of death before my lord the king; and thou hast set me thy servant among the guests of thy table: what <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> complaint therefore have I? or what right to cry any more to the king?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then the king said to him: Why speakest thou any more? what I have said is determined: thou and Siba divide the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And Miphiboseth answered the king: Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is returned peaceably into his house.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Berzellai also the Galaadite coming down from Rogelim, brought the king over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, being ready also to wait on him beyond the river.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Now Berzellai the Galaadite was of a great age, that is to say, fourscore years old, and he provided the king with sustenance when he abode in the camp: for he was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> exceeding rich.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the king said to Berzellai: Come with me that thou mayest rest secure with me in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And Berzellai said to the king: How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> I am this day fourscore years old, are my senses quick to discern sweet and bitter? or can meat or drink delight thy servant? or can I hear any more the voice of singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and singing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>? why should thy servant be a burden to my lord, the king?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> I thy servant will go on a little way from the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> with thee: I need not this recompense.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But I beseech thee let thy servant return, and die in my own city, and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and of my mother. But there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my lord, the king, and do to him whatsoever seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Then the king said to him: Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do for him whatsoever shall please thee, and all that thou shalt ask of me, thou shalt obtain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And when all the people and the king had passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, the king <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> Berzellai, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him: and he returned to his own place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> So the king went on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him. Now all the people of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> had brought the king over, and only half of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> running together to the king, said to him: Why have our brethren the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> stolen thee away, and have brought the king and his household over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> with him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> answered the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Because the king is nearer to me: why art thou <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for this matter? have we eaten any thing of the king's, or have any gifts been given us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> answered the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, and said: I have ten parts in the king more than thou, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> belongeth to me more than to thee: why hast thou done me a wrong, and why was it not told me first, that I might bring back my king? And the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> answered more harshly than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
