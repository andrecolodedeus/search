<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after these things <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: Shall I go up into one of the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>? And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Go up. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said: Whither shall I go up? And he answered him: Into <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went up, and his two wives Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also that were with him, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> brought up every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his household: and they abode in the towns of <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> came, and anointed <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> there, to be king over the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a>. And it was told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jabes Galaad had buried <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> therefore sent messengers to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jabes Galaad, and said to them: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be you to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who have shown this mercy to your master <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and have buried him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> surely will render you mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and I also will requite you for this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> turn, because you have done this thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of valour: for although your master <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> be dead, yet the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a> hath anointed me to be their king.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> the son of Ner, general of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul's</a> army, took Isboseth the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and led him about through the camp,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And made him king over Galaad, and over Gessuri, and over Jezrahel, and over Ephraim, and over <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Isboseth the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was forty years old when he began to reign over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and he reigned two years; and only the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a> followed <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>He reigned two years...</strong> Viz., before he began visibly to decline: but in all he reigned seven years and six months; for so long <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> reigned in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the number of the days that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> abode, reigning in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> over the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a>, was seven years and six months.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> the son of Ner, and the servants of Isboseth the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, went out from the camp to Gabaon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Joab the son of Sarvia, and the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went out, and met them by the <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a> of Gabaon. And when they were come together, they sat down over against one another: the one on the one side of the <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a>, and the other on the other side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> said to Joab: Let the young men rise, and play before us. And Joab answered: Let them rise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then there arose and went over twelve in number of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, of the part of Isboseth the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and twelve of the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And every one catching his fellow by the head, thrust his sword into the side of his adversary, and they fell down together: and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the place was called: The field of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a>, in Gabaon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And there was a very fierce battle that day: and <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> was put to flight, with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, by the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And there were the three sons of Sarvia there, Joab, and <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a>, and Asael: now Asael was a most swift runner, like one of the roes that abide in the woods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Asael pursued after <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, and turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> looked behind him, and said: Art thou Asael? And he answered: I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> said to him: Go to the right hand or to the left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take thee his spoils. But Asael would not leave off following him close.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And again <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> said to Asael: Go off, and do not follow me, lest I be obliged to stab thee to the ground, and I shall not be able to hold up my face to Joab thy brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he refused to hearken to him, and would not turn aside: wherefore <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> struck him with his spear with a back stroke in the groin, and thrust him through, and he died upon the spot: and all that came to the place where Asael fell down and died stood still.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now while Joab and <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a> pursued after <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, the sun went down: and they came as far as the hill of the aqueduct, that lieth over against the valley by the way of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> in Gabaon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> gathered themselves together to <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>: and being joined in one body, they stood on the top of a hill.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> cried out to Joab, and said: Shall thy sword rage unto utter destruction? knowest thou not that it is dangerous to drive people to despair? how long dost thou defer to bid the people cease from pursuing after their brethren?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Joab said: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, if thou hadst spoke sooner, even in the morning the people should have retired from pursuing after their brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood still, and did not pursue after <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> any farther, nor fight any more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> walked all that night through the plains: and they passed the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and having gone through all Beth-horon, came to the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And Joab returning, after he had left <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, assembled all the people: and there were wanting of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> servants nineteen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, beside Asael.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But the servants of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had killed of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, three hundred and sixty, who all died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they took Asael, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> and Joab, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, marched all the night, and they came to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> at break of day.</span></p>
