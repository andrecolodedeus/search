<div class="h1a">Seba's rebellion. Amasa is slain by Joab. Abela is besieged, but upon the citizens casting over the wall the head of Seba, Joab departs with all his army.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And there happened to be there a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Seba, the son of Bochri, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of Jemini: and he sounded the trumpet, and said: We have no part in <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, nor inheritance in the son of Isai: return to thy dwellings, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> departed from <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and followed Seba the son of Bochri: but the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> stuck to their king from the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> unto <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when the king was come into his house at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he took the ten <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them inward, allowing them provisions: and he went not in unto them, but they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king said to Amasa: Assemble to me all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> against the third day, and be thou here present.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So Amasa went to assemble the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, but he tarried beyond the set time which the king had appointed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a>: Now will Seba the son of Bochri do us more harm than did <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>: take thou therefore the servants of thy lord, and pursue after him, lest he find fenced cities, and escape us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So Joab's <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went out with him, and the Cerethi and the Phelethi: and all the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to pursue after Seba the son of Bochri.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when they were at the great stone which is in Gabaon, Amasa coming met them. And Joab had on a close coat of equal length with his habit, and over it was girded with a sword hanging down to his flank, in a scabbard, made in such manner as to come out with the least motion and strike.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joab said to Amasa: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> save thee, my brother. And he took Amasa by the chin with his right hand to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But Amasa did not take notice of the sword, which Joab had, and he struck him in the side, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and gave him not a second wound, and he died. And Joab, and <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a> his brother pursued after Seba the son of Bochri.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> In the mean time some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Joab's company stopping at the dead body of Amasa, said: Behold he that would have been in Joab's stead the companion of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Amasa imbrued with blood, lay in the midst of the way. A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> saw this that all the people stood still to look upon him, so he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and covered him with a garment, that they who passed might, not stop on his account.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when he was removed out of the way, all the people went on following Joab to pursue after Seba the son of Bochri.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now he had passed through all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> unto <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">Abela and Bethmaacha</a>: and all the chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were gathered together unto him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Abela and Bethmaacha...</strong> Cities of the <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">tribe of Nephtali</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they came, and besieged him in Abela, and in Bethmaacha, and they cast up works round the city, and the city was besieged: and all the people that were with Joab, laboured to throw down the walls.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And a wise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cried out from the city: Hear, hear, and say to Joab: Come near hither, and I will speak with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when he was come near to her, she said to him: Art thou Joab? And he answered: I am. And she spoke thus to him: Hear the words of thy handmaid. He answered: I do hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And she again said: A saying was used in the old proverb: They that inquire, let them inquire in Abela: and so they made an end.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Am not I she that answer <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and thou seekest to destroy the city, and to overthrow a mother in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Why wilt thou throw down the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Joab answering said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should, I do not throw down, nor destroy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The matter is not so, but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of mount Ephraim, Seba the son of Bochri by <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, hath lifted up his hand against <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>: deliver him only, and we will depart from the city. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to Joab: Behold his head shall be thrown to thee from the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So she went to all the people, and spoke to them wisely: and they cut off the head of Seba the son of Bochri, and cast it out to Joab. And he sounded the trumpet, and they departed from the city, every one to their home: and Joab returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> So Joab was over all the army of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias the son of Joiada</a> was over the Cerethites and Phelethites,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But Aduram over the tributes: and Josaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And Siva was scribe: and Sadoc and <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And Ira the Jairite was the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span></p>
