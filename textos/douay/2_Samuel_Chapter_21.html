<div class="h1a">A famine of three years, for the sin of Saul against the Gabaonites, at whose desire seven of Saul's race are crucified. War again with the Philistines.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And there was a famine in the days of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> for three years successively: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> consulted the oracle of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: It is for <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and his bloody house, because he slow the Gabaonites.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then the king, calling for the Gabaonites, said to them: (Now the Gabaonites were not of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, but the remains of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> had sworn to them, and <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> sought to slay them out of zeal, as it were for the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>:)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> therefore said to the Gabaonites: What shall I do for you? and what shall be the <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement</a> or you, that you may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the Gabaonites said to him: We have no contest about silver and gold, but against <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and against his house: neither do we desire that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be slain of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the king said to them: What will you then that I should do for you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they said to the king: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that crushed us and oppressed us <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, we must destroy in such manner that there be not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Let seven <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of his children be delivered unto us, that we may crucify them to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in Gabaa of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, once the chosen of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And the king said: I will give them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the king spared Miphiboseth the son of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, because of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that had been between <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, Armoni, and Miphiboseth: and the five sons of Michol the daughter of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, whom she bore to Hadriel the son of Berzellai, that was of Molathi: <span class="stiki"><strong>Of Michol...</strong> They were the sons of Merob, who was <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> to Hadriel: but they are here called the sons of Michol, because she <a href="../cathen/01147a.htm">adopted</a> them, and brought them up as her own.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And gave them into the hands of the Gabaonites: and they crucified them on a hill before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and these seven died together in the first days of the harvest, when the barley began to be reaped.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Respha the daughter of Aia took haircloth, and spread it under her upon the rock from the beginning of the harvest, till water dropped upon them out of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and suffered neither the birds to tear them by day, nor the beasts by night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, what Respha the daughter of Aia, the <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went, and took the bones of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and the bones of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Jabes Galaad, who had stolen them from the street of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had hanged them when they had slain <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> in Gelboe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he brought from thence the bones of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and the bones of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son, and they gathered up the bones of them that were crucified,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they buried them with the bones of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> his son in the land of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, in the side, in the sepulchre of Cis his father: and they did all that the king had commanded, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> showed mercy again to the land after these things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> again against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> growing faint,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Jesbibenob, who was of the race of Arapha, the iron of whose spear weighed three hundred ounces, being girded with a new sword, attempted to kill <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai the son of Sarvia</a> rescued him, and striking the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> killed him. Then <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> unto him saying: Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, lest thou put out the lamp of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> There was also a second battle in Gob against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: then Sobochai of Husathi slew Saph of the race of Arapha of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the giants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And there was a third battle in Gob against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, in which Adeodatus the son of the Forrest an <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroiderer</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> slew Goliath the Gethite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. <span class="stiki"><strong>Adeodatus the son of the Forrest...</strong> So it is rendered in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a>, by giving the interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew names</a>, which are Elhanan the son of Jaare.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> A fourth battle was in Geth: where there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of great stature, that had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, four and twenty in all, and he was of the race of Arapha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he reproached <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of Samae the brother of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> slew him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> These four were born of Arapha in Geth, and they fell by the hand of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and of his servants.</span></p>
