<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> spoke to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the words of this canticle, in the day that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is my rock, and my strength, and my saviour.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is my strong one, in him will I trust: my shield, and the horn of my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: he lifteth me up, and is my refuge: my saviour, thou wilt deliver me from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I will call on the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> who is worthy to be praised: and I shall be saved from my enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For the pangs of death have surrounded me: the floods of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> have made me afraid.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The cords of hell compassed me: the snares of death prevented me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> In my distress I will call upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I will cry to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and he will hear my voice out of his <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and my cry shall come to his ears.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The earth shook and trembled, the foundations of the mountains were moved, and shaken, because he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> A smoke went up from his nostrils, and a devouring fire out of his mouth: coals were kindled by it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He bowed the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he rode upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>, and flew: and slid upon the wings of the wind.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He made darkness a covering round about him: dropping waters out of the clouds of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> By the brightness before him, the coals of fire were kindled.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall thunder from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and the most high shall give forth his voice.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He shot arrows and scattered them: lightning, and consumed them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the overflowings of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid open at the rebuke of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, at the blast of the spirit of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He sent from on high, and took me, and drew me out of many waters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He delivered me from my most mighty enemy, and from them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me: for they were too strong for me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He prevented me in the day of my affliction, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> became my stay.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he brought me forth into a large place, he delivered me, because I pleased him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will reward me according to my <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and according to the cleanness of my hands he will render to me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Because I have kept the ways of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and have not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a> departed from my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For all his judgments are in my sight: and his precepts I have not removed from me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And I shall be perfect with him: and shall keep myself from my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will recompense me according to my <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and according to the cleanness of my hands in the sight of his eyes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> With the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one thou wilt be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: and with the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> perfect.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> people thou wilt save: and with thy eyes thou shalt humble the haughty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For thou art my lamp O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, wilt enlighten my darkness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For in thee I will run girded: in my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I will leap over the wall.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his way is immaculate, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> is tried by fire: he is the shield of all that trust in him.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who hath girded me with strength, and made my way perfect.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Making my feet like the feet of harts, and setting me upon my high places.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> He teacheth my hands to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and maketh my arms like a bow of brass.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Thou hast given me the shield of my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and thy mildness hath multiplied me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Thou shalt enlarge my steps under me: and my ankles shall not fail.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> I will pursue after my enemies, and crush them: and will not return again till I consume them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> I will consume them and break them in pieces, so that they shall not rise: they shall fall under my feet.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast made them that resisted me to bow under me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> My enemies thou hast made to turn their back to me: them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me, and I shall destroy them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> They shall cry, and there shall be none to save: to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he shall not hear them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> I shall beat them as small as the dust of the earth: I shall crush them and spread them abroad like the mire of the streets.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Thou wilt save me from the contradictions of my people: thou wilt keep me to be the head of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: the people which I know not, shall serve me,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> The sons of the stranger will resist me, at the hearing of the ear they will <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me.</span><br />
