<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now these are <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> last words. <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> the son of Isai said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to whom it was appointed concerning the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, the excellent psalmist of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a> hath spoken by me and his word by my tongue.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to me, the strong one of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> spoke, the ruler of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> ruler in the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds, and as the grass springeth out of the earth by rain. <span class="stiki"><strong>As the light, etc...</strong> So shall be the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Neither is my house so great with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he should make with me an eternal covenant, firm in all things and assured. For he is all my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and all my will: neither is there ought thereof that springeth not up. <span class="stiki"><strong>Neither is my house, etc...</strong> As if he should say: This everlasting covenant was not due to my house: but purely owing to his bounty; who is all my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and my will: that is, who hath always saved me, and granted me what I beseeched of him; so that I and my house, through his <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, have sprung up, and succeeded in all things.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But transgressors shall all of them be plucked up as thorns: which are not taken away with hands.</span><br />

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> These are the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Jesbaham sitting in the chair was the wisest chief among the three, he was like the most tender little worm of the wood, who killed eight hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> at one onset. <span class="stiki"><strong>Jesbaham...</strong> The son of Hachamoni. For this was the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of this hero, as appears from <a href="../douay/1ch011.htm#verse11">1 Chronicles 11</a>. -- Ibid. <strong>Most tender, etc...</strong> He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> and strong. It seems the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> has here given the interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew name</a> of the hero, to whom Jesbaham was like, instead of the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> itself, which was Adino the Eznite, one much renowned of old for his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valour</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> After him was <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> when they defied the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and they were there gathered together to battle. <span class="stiki"><strong>Dodo...</strong> In <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>Patrui ejus</em>, which is the interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew name</a> <em>Dodo</em>. The same occurs in <a href="../douay/2sa023.htm#verse24">verse 24</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were gone away, he stood and smote the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> till his hand was weary, and grew stiff with the sword: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> wrought a great victory that day: and the people that were fled away, returned to take spoils of them that were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And after him was Semma the son of Age of Arari. And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were gathered together in a troop: for there was a field full of lentils. And when the people were fled from the face of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He stood in the midst of the field, and defended it, and defeated the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave a great victory.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Moreover also before this the three who were princes among the thirty, went down and came to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in the harvest time into the <a href="../cathen/01162a.htm">cave of Odollam</a>: and the camp of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> was in the valley of the giants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was then in a hold: and there was a garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> then in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> longed, and said: O that some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would get me a drink of the water out of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cistern</a>, that is in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, by the gate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the three <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> broke through the camp of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and drew water out of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cistern</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, that was by the gate, and brought it to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: but he would not drink, but offered it to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be merciful to me, that I may not do this: shall I drink the blood of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that went, and the peril of their lives? therefore he would not drink.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia</a>, was chief among three: and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias the son of Joiada</a> a most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of great deeds, of Cabseel: he slew the two lions of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and he went down, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of snow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> He also slew an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> worthy to be a sight, having a spear in his hand: but he went down to him with a rod, and forced the spear out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, and slew him with his own spear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> These things did <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias the son of Joiada</a>.</span>
