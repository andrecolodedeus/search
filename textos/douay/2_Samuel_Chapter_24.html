<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the king said to Joab the general of his army: Go through all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> from <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a> to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>, and number ye the people that I may know the number of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Joab said to the king: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> increase thy people, and make them as many more as they are now, and again multiply them a hundredfold in the sight of my lord the king: but what meaneth my lord the king by this kind of thing?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the king's words prevailed over the words of Joab, and of the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army: and Joab, and the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the soldiers went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when they had passed the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, they came to Aroer to the right side of the city, which is in the vale of <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And by Jazer they passed into Galaad, and to the lower land of Hodsi, and they came into the woodlands of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>. And going about by <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They passed near the walls of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and all the land of the Hevite, and the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and they came to the south of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> into <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And having gone through the whole land, after nine months and twenty days, they came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king, and there were found of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> eight hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that drew the sword: and of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> five hundred thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose in the morning, and the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and the seer of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Go, and say to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: I give thee thy choice of three things, choose one of them which thou wilt, that I may do it to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a> was come to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, he told him, saying: Either seven years of famine shall come to thee in thy land: or thou shalt flee three months before thy adversaries, and they shall pursue thee: or for three days there shall be a pestilence in thy land. Now therefore deliberate, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a>: I am in a great strait: but it is better that I should fall into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> (for his mercies are many) than into the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent a pestilence upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, from the morning unto the time appointed, and there died of the people from <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a> to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a> seventy thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> had stretched out his hand over <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to destroy it, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had pity on the affliction, and said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that slew the people: It is enough: now hold thy hand. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> was by the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, when he saw the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> striking the people: It is I; I am he that have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, I have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>: these that are the sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I beseech thee, be turned against me, and against my father's house.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a> came to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> that day, and said: Go up, and build an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went up according to the word of <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#III">Gad</a> which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Areuna looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And going out he worshipped the king, bowing with his face to the earth, and said: Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to him: To buy the thrashingfloor of thee, and build an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that the plague, which rageth among the people, may cease.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Areuna said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Let my lord the king take, and offer, as it seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him: thou hast here oxen for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and the wain, and the yokes of the oxen for wood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> All these things Areuna as a king gave to the king: and Areuna said to the king: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> receive thy <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the king answered him, and said: Nay, but I will buy it of thee, at a price, and I will not offer to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> free cost. So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> bought the floor, and the oxen, for fifty sicles of silver:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> built there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> became merciful to the land, and the plague was stayed from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
