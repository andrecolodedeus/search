<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now there was a long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> prospering and growing always stronger and stronger, but the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> decaying daily. <span class="stiki"><strong>There was a long war between the house of Saul, etc...</strong> Rather a strife or emulation than a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with arms; it lasted five years and a half.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And sons were born to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>: and his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> was Ammon of Achinoam the Jezrahelitess:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And his second Cheleab of Abigail the wife of Nabal of <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>: and the third <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmai king of Gessur:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now while there was <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> and the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> the son of Ner ruled the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> had a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Respha, the daughter of Aia.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Why didst thou go in to my father's <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>? And he was exceedingly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for the words of Isboseth, and said: Am I a dog's head against <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> this day, who have shown mercy to the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> thy father, and to his brethren and friends, and have not delivered thee into the hands of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and hast thou sought this day against me to charge me with a matter concerning a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So do <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, and more also, unless as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath sworn to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, so I do to him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> That the kingdom be translated from the house of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and the throne of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> be set up over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and over <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> from <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a> to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he could not answer him a word, because he feared him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> therefore sent messengers to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> for himself, saying: Whose is the land? and that they should say: Make a league with me, and my hand shall be with thee: and I will bring all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he said: Very well: I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, saying: Thou shalt not see my face before thou bring Michol the daughter of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>: and so thou shalt come, and see me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sent messengers to Isboseth the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, saying: Restore my wife Michol, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Isboseth sent, and took her from her husband Phaltiel, the son of Lais.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And her husband followed her, weeping as far as Bahurim: and <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> said to him: Go and return. And he returned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> also spoke to the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: Both yesterday and the day before you sought for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> that he might reign over you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Now then do it: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, saying: By the hand of my servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> I will save my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and of all their enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> spoke also to <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>. And he went to speak to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> all that seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and to all <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he came to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> with twenty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> made a feast for <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that came with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: I will rise, that I may gather all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> unto thee my lord the king, and may enter into a league with thee, and that thou mayst reign over all as thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desireth. Now when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had brought <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> on his way, and he was gone in peace,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Immediately, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a> servants and Joab came, after having slain the robbers, with an exceeding great booty. And <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> was not with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, for he had now sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Joab and all the army that was with him, came afterwards: and it was told Joab, that <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Joab went in to the king, and said: What hast thou done? Behold <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> came to thee: Why didst thou send him away, and he is gone and departed?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Knowest thou not <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> the son of Ner, that to this end he came to thee, that he might deceive thee, and to know thy going out, and thy coming in, and to know all thou dost?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then Joab going out from <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, sent messengers after <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, and brought him back from the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cistern</a> of Sira, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> knowing nothing of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> was returned to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate, to speak to him treacherously: and he stabbed him there in the groin, and he died, in revenge of the blood of Asael his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> heard of it, after the thing was now done, he said: I, and my kingdom are innocent before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for ever of the blood of <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> the son of Ner:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And may it come upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house: and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue of seed, or that is a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, or that holdeth the distaff, or that falleth by the sword, or that wanteth bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> So Joab and <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abisai</a> his brother slew <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, because he had killed their brother Asael at Gabaon in the battle.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him: Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloths</a>, and mourn before the funeral of <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>. And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> himself followed the bier.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when they had buried <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>: and all the people also wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the king mourning and lamenting over <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a>, said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Not as cowards are wont to die, hath <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> died.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet laden with fetters: but as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> fall before the children of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, so didst thou fall.</blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose">And all the people repeating it wept over him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when all the people came to take meat with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, while it was yet broad day, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a>, saying: So do <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to me, and more also, if I taste bread or any thing else before sunset.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And all the people heard, and they were pleased, and all that the king did seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the sight of all the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And all the people, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> understood that day that it was not the king's doing, that <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> the son of Ner was slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> The king also said to his servants: Do you not know that a prince and a great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is slain this day in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But I as yet am tender, though anointed king. And these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the sons of Sarvia are too hard for me: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> reward him that doth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> according to his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span></p>
