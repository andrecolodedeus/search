<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> had two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of his bands, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the one was Baana, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, the sons of Remmon a <a href="../cathen/02515a.htm">Berothite</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a>: for <a href="../cathen/02515a.htm">Beroth</a> also was reckoned in <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/02515a.htm">Berothites</a> fled into Gethaim, and were sojourners there until that time.</span>

And his nurse took him up and fled: and as she made haste to flee, he fell and became lame: and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Miphiboseth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the sons of Remmon the <a href="../cathen/02515a.htm">Berothite</a>, <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a> and Baana coming, went into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: and he was sleeping upon his bed at noon.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of corn, and <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a> and Baana his brother stabbed him in the groin, and fled away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For when they came into the house, he was sleeping upon his bed in a parlour, and they struck him and killed him and taking away his head they went off by the way of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, walking all night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they brought the head of Isboseth to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>: and they said to the king: Behold the head of Isboseth the son of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> thy enemy who sought thy life: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath revenged my lord the king this day of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, and of his seed.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that told me, and said: <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> is dead, who thought he brought <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tidings, I apprehended, and slew him in Siceleg, who should have been rewarded for his news.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> commanded his servants and they slew them: and cutting off their hands and feet, hanged them up over the <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>: but the head of Isboseth they took and buried in the sepulchre of <a href="../cathen/01045a.htm">Abner</a> in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span></p>
