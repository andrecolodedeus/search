<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Moreover yesterday also and the day before, when <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> was king over us, thou wast he that did lead out and bring in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and thou shalt be prince over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> dwelt in the castle, and called it, The city of David: and built round about from Mello and inwards.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> coming spread themselves in the valley of Raphaim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, Saying: Shall I go up to the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> came to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> Pharisim: and defeated them there, and he said, The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath divided my enemies before me, as waters are divided.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they left there their idols: which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> took away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> came up again and spread themselves into the valley of Raphaim.</span>
