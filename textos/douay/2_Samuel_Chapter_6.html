<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> again gathered together all the chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, thirty thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> arose and went, with all the people that were with him of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> to fetch the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>, upon which the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of Hosts is invoked, who sitteth over it upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they laid the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> upon a new cart: and took it out of the house of Abinadab, who was in Gabaa, and Oza and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. <span class="stiki"><strong>Gabaa...</strong> The hill of Cariathiarim, where the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> had been in the house of Abinadab, from the time of its being restored back by the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they had taken it out of the house of Abinadab, who was in Gabaa, Ahio having care of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> went before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> played before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> on all manner of instruments made of wood, on harps and lutes and timbrels and cornets and cymbals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when they came to the floor of Nachon, Oza put forth his hand to the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>, and took hold of it: because the oxen kicked and made it lean aside.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the indignation of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was enkindled against Oza, and he struck him for his rashness: and he died there before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was grieved because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had struck Oza, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place was called: The striking of Oza, to this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was afraid of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that day, saying: How shall the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> come to me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he would not have the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> brought in to himself into the city of David: but he caused it to be carried into the house of Obededom the Gethite.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> abode in the house of Obededom the Gethite three months: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> Obededom, and all his household.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> Obededom, and all that he had, because of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when they that carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> had gone six paces, he <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> and ox and a ram:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">danced</a> with all his might before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was girded with a linen <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> was come into the city of David, Michol the daughter of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, looking out through a window, saw <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">king David</a> <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">leaping and dancing</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and she <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> him in her heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they brought the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>, and set it in its place in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had pitched for it: and <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when he had made an end of <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the people in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he distributed to all the multitude of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, to every one, a cake of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and fine flour fried with oil: and all the people departed every one to his own house.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> his own house: and Michol the daughter of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> coming out to meet <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, said: How <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> was the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to day, uncovering himself before the handmaids of his servants, and was naked, as if one of the buffoons should be naked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> said to Michol: Before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who chose me rather than thy father, and than all his house, and commanded me to be ruler over the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> I will both play and make myself meaner than I have done: and I will be little in my own eyes: and with the handmaids of whom thou speakest, I shall appear more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Therefore Michol the daughter of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> had no child to the day of her death.</span></p>
