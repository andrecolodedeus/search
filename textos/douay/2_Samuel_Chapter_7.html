<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He said to <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan the prophet</a>: Dost thou see that I dwell in a house of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of God</a> is lodged within skins?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> said to the king: Go, do all that is in they heart: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But it came to pass that night, that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Go, and say to my servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Shalt thou build me a house to dwell in?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Whereas I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> even to this day: but have walked in a <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and in a tent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> In all the places that I have gone through with all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, did ever I speak a word to any one of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, whom I commanded to feed my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: Why have you not built me a house of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And now thus shalt thou speak to my servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: I took thee out of the pastures from following the sheep to be ruler over my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I have been with thee wheresoever thou hast walked, and have slain all thy enemies from before thy face: and I have made thee a great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, like unto the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the great ones that are on the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I will appoint a place for my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and I will plant them, and they shall dwell therein, and shall be disturbed no more: neither shall the children of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> afflict them any more as they did before,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> From the day that I appointed judges over my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and I will give thee rest from all thy enemies.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of the bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. <span class="stiki"><strong>I will establish his kingdom...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> partly relateth to <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>: but much more to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is called the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>, and who is the builder of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, his <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">everlasting kingdom</a>, which shall never fail.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He shall build a house to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom fore ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and if he commit any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, I will correct him with the rod of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and with the stripes of the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it from <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a>, whom I removed from before my face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And thy house shall be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a>, and thy kingdom for ever before thy face, and thy throne shall be firm for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> According to all these words and according to all this vision so did <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a> speak to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Bur yet this hath seemed little in thy sight, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, unless thou didst also speak of the house of thy servant for a long time to come: for this is the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And what can <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For thy word's sake, and according to thy own heart thou has done all these great things, so that thou wouldst make it known to thy servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Therefore thou art magnified, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, because there is none like to thee, neither is there any <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> besides thee, in all the things that we have heard with our ears.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And what nation is there upon earth, as thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went to <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> for a people to himself, and to make him a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and to do for them great and terrible things, upon the earth, before the face of thy people, whom thou <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemedst</a> to thyself out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from the nations and their gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to be an everlasting people: and thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, art become their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And now, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, raise up for ever the word that thou hast spoken, concerning thy servant and concerning his house: and do as thou hast spoken,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> That thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> may be magnified for ever, and it may be said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the house of thy servant <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> shall be established before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Because thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, saying: I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And now, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, thou art <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thy words shall be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: for thou hast spoken to thy servant these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And now begin, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the house of thy servant, that it may endure for ever before thee: because thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, hast spoken it, and with thy <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> let the house of thy servant be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> for ever.</span></p>
