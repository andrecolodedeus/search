<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and of our gathering together unto him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> That you be not easily moved from your sense nor be <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">terrified</a>, neither by <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> nor by word nor by <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> as sent from us, as if the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of the Lord</a> were at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deceive you by any means: for unless there come a revolt first, and the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">man of sin</a> be revealed, the son of perdition <span class="stiki"><strong>A revolt...</strong> This revolt, or falling off, is generally understood, by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">ancient fathers</a>, of a revolt from the Roman empire, which was first to be destroyed, before the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. It may, perhaps, be understood also of a revolt of many nations from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Catholic Church</a>; which has, in part, happened already, by means of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mahomet</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, etc., and it may be supposed, will be more general in the days of the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. <strong>The man of sin...</strong> Here must be meant some particular <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as is evident from the frequent repetition of the Greek article <em>ho antikeimenos</em>, the man of sin, the son of perdition, the adversary or opposer. It agrees to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and great <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, who will come before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Who opposeth and is lifted up above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or that is <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">worshipped</a>, so that he sitteth in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, showing himself as if he were <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>In the temple...</strong> Either <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">that of Jerusalem</a> which some think he will rebuild; or in some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, which he will pervert to his own worship: as <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mahomet</a> has done by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">east</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Remember you not that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And now you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> already worketh: only that he who now holdeth do hold, until he be taken out of the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And then that <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">wicked one</a> shall be revealed: whom the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> shall kill with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: him</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Whose coming is according to the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, in all power and signs and <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> wonders:</span>
