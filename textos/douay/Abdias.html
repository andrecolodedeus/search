<div class="h1a">The Prophecy of Abdias, also called Obadiah</div>

<p class="stiki">ABDIAS, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is interpreted THE SERVANT OF THE LORD, is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> about the same time as <!--<a href="../cathen/11337a.htm">-->OSEE<!--</a>-->, <!--<a href="../cathen/08419a.htm">-->JOEL<!--</a>-->, and <!--<a href="../cathen/01435a.htm">-->AMOS<!--</a>-->: though some of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him to be the same with <!--<a href="../cathen/01101b.htm">-->Achab's<!--</a>--> steward, make him much more ancient. His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> is the shortest of any in <!--<a href="../cathen/11151a.htm">-->number<!--</a>--> of words, but yields to none, says St. Jerome, in the sublimity of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. It contains but one chapter. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/01030b.htm">ABDIAS</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)</p>
