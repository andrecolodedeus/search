<div class="h1a">The ascension of Christ. Matthias is chosen in place of Judas.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The <a href="../douay/luk000.htm">former treatise I made</a>, O Theophilus, of all things which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to do and to teach,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Until the day on which, giving commandments by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> whom he had chosen, he was taken up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> To whom also he showed himself alive after his <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>, by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, for forty days appearing to them, and speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And eating together with them, he commanded them, that they should not depart from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but should wait for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">promise of the Father</a>, which you have heard (saith he) by my mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water: but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, not many days hence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> They therefore who were come together, asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">kingdom of Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But he said to them: It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> or moments, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath put in his own power:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But you shall receive the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> coming upon you, and you shall be <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> unto me in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and in all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and even to the uttermost part of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when he had said these things, while they looked on, he was <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">raised up</a>: and a cloud received him out of their sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And while they were beholding him going up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, behold two men stood by them in white garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who also said: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, why stand you looking up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>? This <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who is taken up from you into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, shall so come as you have seen him <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">going into heaven</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then they returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount that is called Olivet</a>, which is nigh <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, within a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day's</a> journey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a> and <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a>, <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> and <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, <a href="../cathen/02313c.htm">Bartholomew</a> and <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">Matthew</a>, <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James of Alpheus</a> and <a href="../cathen/13796b.htm">Simon Zelotes</a> and <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude the brother of James</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> All these were persevering with one mind in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary the mother of Jesus</a>, and with his <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> In those days <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> rising up in the midst of the brethren, said (now the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> together was about an hundred and twenty):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Men, brethren, the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> must needs be fulfilled, which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> spoke before by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, who was the leader of them that apprehended <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Who was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and being hanged, burst asunder in the midst: and all his bowels gushed out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And it became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: so that the same field was called in their tongue, <a href="../cathen/07103b.htm"><em>Haceldama</em></a>, that is to say, <em>The field of blood</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For it is written in the <a href="../douay/psa000.htm">book of Psalms</a>: Let their habitation become desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein. And his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> let another take.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Wherefore of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who have companied with us, all the time that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> came in and went out among us,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Beginning from the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, until the day wherein he was <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">taken up</a> from us, one of these must be made a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> with us of his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, they said: Thou, Lord, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> the heart of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, show whether of these two thou hast chosen,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> To take the place of this <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostleship</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> hath by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">transgression</a> fallen, that he might go to his own place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they gave them <a href="../cathen/09366b.htm">lot</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09366b.htm">lot</a> fell upon <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a>, and he was numbered with the eleven <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</span></p>
