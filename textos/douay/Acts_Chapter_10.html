<div class="h1a">Cornelius is received into the Church. Peter's vision.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And there was a certain man in <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> of that which is called the Italian band:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> A <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with all his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">house</a>, giving much <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the people and always <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> saw in a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> manifestly, about the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a> of the day, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a> coming in unto him and saying to him: <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said: What is it, Lord? And he said to him: Thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and thy <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are ascended for a memorial in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And now send men to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>: and call hither one <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon, who is surnamed Peter</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who spoke to him was departed, he called two of his household servants and a soldier who feared the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, of them that were under him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> To whom when he had related all, he sent them to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And on the next day, whilst they were going on their journey and drawing nigh to the city, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> went up to the higher parts of the house to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, about the <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth hour</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And being hungry, he was desirous to taste somewhat. And as they were preparing, there came upon him an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy of mind</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to the earth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth and fowls of the air.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And there came a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">voice</a> to him: Arise, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>. Kill and eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said: Far be it from me. For I never did eat any thing that is common and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the voice spoke to him again the second time: That which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath cleansed, do not thou call common.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And this was done thrice. And presently the vessel was taken up into heaven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now, whilst <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubting</a> within himself what the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> that he had seen should mean, behold the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who were sent from <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>, inquiring for <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon's</a> house, stood at the gate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when they had called, they asked if <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon, who is surnamed Peter</a>, were lodged there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And as <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was thinking of the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> said to him: Behold three men seek thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Arise, therefore: get thee down and go with them, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubting</a> nothing: for I have sent them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, going down to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, said: Behold, I am he whom you seek. What is the cause for which you are come?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Who said: <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and one that feareth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> testimony from all the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, received an answer of an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, to send for thee into his house And to hear words of thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then bringing them in, he lodged them. And the day following, he arose and went with them: and some of the brethren from <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> accompanied him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the morrow after, he entered into <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>. And <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> waited for them, having called together his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsmen</a> and special friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And it came to pass that when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was come in, <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> came to meet him and falling at his feet <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> lifted him up, saying: Arise: I myself also am a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And talking with him, he went in and found many that were come together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he said to them: you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how abominable it is for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> to keep company or to come unto one of another nation: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath showed to me, to call no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> common or <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For which cause, making no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, I came when I was sent for. I ask, therefore, for what cause you have sent for me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> said: Four days ago, unto this hour, I was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in my house, at the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a> and behold a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stood before me in white apparel and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>, thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is heard and thy <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are had in remembrance in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Send therefore to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>: and call hither <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon, who is surnamed Peter</a>. He lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Immediately therefore I sent to thee: and thou hast done well in coming. Now, therefore, all we are present in thy sight to hear all things whatsoever are commanded thee by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> opening his mouth, said: in very deed I perceive that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is acceptable to him. <span class="stiki"><strong>In every nation, etc...</strong> That is to say, not only <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also, of what nation soever, are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if they fear him and work <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is always to be presupposed, without which (saith <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../douay/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews 11:6</a>) it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Beware then of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those, who would infer from this passage, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of all religions may be pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For since none but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">true religion</a> can be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all other religions must be from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">father of lies</a>, and therefore highly displeasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, preaching peace by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (He is Lord of all).</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>: how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> anointed him with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with power, who went about doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and healing all that were oppressed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was with him.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised up</a> the third day and gave him to be made manifest,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that it is he who was appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be judge of the living and of the dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> To him all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> give testimony, that by his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> all receive <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">remission</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, who came with <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, were astonished for that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was poured out upon the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> For they heard them <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speaking with tongues</a> and magnifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
