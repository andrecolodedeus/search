<div class="h1a">Peter defends his having received the Gentiles into the Church.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and brethren, who were in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, heard that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also had received the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was come up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">they that were of the circumcision</a> contended with him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Saying: Why didst thou go in to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> uncircumcised and didst eat with them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> began and declared to them the matter in order, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I was in the city of <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>: and I saw in an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy of mind</a> a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. And it came even unto me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Into which looking, I considered and saw fourfooted creatures of the earth and beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I heard also a voice saying to me: Arise, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>. Kill and eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I said: Not so, Lord: for nothing common or <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> hath ever entered into my mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the voice answered again from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: What <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made clean, do not thou call common.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And this was done three times. And all were taken up again into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And behold, immediately there were three <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> come to the house wherein I was, sent to me from <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> said to me that I should go with them, nothing doubting. And these six brethren went with me also: and we entered into the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he told us how he had seen an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in his house, standing and saying to him: Send to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> and call hither <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon, who is surnamed Peter</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Who shall speak to thee words whereby thou shalt be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, and all thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">house</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when I had begun to speak, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fell upon them, as upon us also in the beginning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And I remembered the word of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, how that he said: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> If then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as to us also who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>: who was I, that could withstand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Having heard these things, they held their peace and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> then hath also to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> given repentance, unto life.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now they who had been dispersed by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> that arose on occasion of <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a> went about as far as Phenice and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, speaking the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a> to none, but to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But some of them were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>, who, when they were entered into <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, spoke also to the Greeks, preaching the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the hand of he <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> was with them: and a great number <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the tidings came to the ears of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> that was at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, touching these things: and they sent <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> as far as <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Who, when he was come and had seen the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rejoiced. And he exhorted them all with purpose of heart to continue in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For he was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And a great multitude was added to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> went to <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> to seek <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>: whom, when he had found, he brought to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they conversed there in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> a whole year: and they taught a great multitude, so that at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were first <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And in these days there came <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And one of them <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>, rising up, signified by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that there should be a great famine over the whole world, which came to pass under Claudius.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his ability, purposed to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Which also they did, sending it to the ancients, by the hands of <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>.</span></p>
