<div class="h1a">Herod's persecution. Peter's deliverance by an angel. Herod's punishment.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And at the same time, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the king</a> stretched forth his hands, to afflict some of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">killed</a> <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a>, the brother of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, with the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And seeing that it pleased the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he proceeded to take up <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> also. Now it was in the days of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Azymes</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Azymes...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">festival of the unleavened bread</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, which answers to our <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when he had apprehended him, he cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, delivering him to four files of soldiers, to be kept, intending, after the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, to bring him forth to the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> therefore was kept in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was made without ceasing by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> would have brought him forth, the same night, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And behold an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> stood by him and a light shined in the room. And he, striking <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> on the side, raised him up, saying: Arise quickly. And the chains fell off from his hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him: Gird thyself and put on thy sandals. And he did so. And he said to him: Cast thy garment about thee and follow me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And going out, he followed him. And he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that it was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which was done by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: but thought he saw a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And passing through the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city which of itself opened to them. And going out, they passed on through one street. And immediately the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> departed from him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> coming to himself, said: Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in very deed that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> hath sent his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and hath delivered me out of the hand of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and from all the expectation of the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And considering, he came to the house of <a href="../cathen/09749a.htm">Mary the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark</a>, where many were gathered together and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Rhode.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And as soon as she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> voice, she opened not the gate for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: but running in she told that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> stood before the gate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But they said to her: Thou art <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">mad</a>. But she affirmed that it was so. Then said they: It is his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> continued knocking. And when they had opened, they saw him and were astonished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But he, beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace, told how the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> had brought him out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And he said: Tell these things to <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> and to the brethren. And going out, he went into another place.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Now when day was come, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> had sought for him and found him not, having examined the keepers, he commanded they should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. And going down from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, he abode there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the Tyrians and the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>. But they with one accord came to him: and, having gained Blastus who was the king's chamberlain, they desired peace, because their countries were nourished by him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And upon a day appointed, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> being arrayed in kingly apparel, sat in the judgment seat and made an oration to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the people made acclamation, saying: It is the voice of a god, and not of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And forthwith an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> struck him, because he had not given the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and, being eaten up by worms, he gave up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of the Lord</a> increased and multiplied.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, returned from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, having fulfilled their <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>, taking with them <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">John who was surnamed Mark</a>.</span></p>
