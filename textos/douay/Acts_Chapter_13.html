<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now there were in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> which was at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, among whom was <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and Simon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manahen who was the foster brother of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the tetrarch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And as they were ministering to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> said to them: Separate me <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, for the work whereunto I have taken them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then they <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposing their hands</a> upon them, sent them away.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So they, being sent by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, went to Seleucia: and from thence they sailed to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when they were come to Salamina, they preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when they had gone through the whole island, as far as <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a>, they found a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a magician, a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was <a href="../cathen/02296a.htm">Bar-Jesu</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. He, sending for <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, desired to hear the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But Elymas the magician (for so his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is interpreted) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then Saul, otherwise <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, looking upon him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Said: O full of all guile and of all <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>, child of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, enemy of all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, thou ceases not to pervert the right ways of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And now behold, the hand of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> is upon thee: and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately there fell a mist and darkness upon him: and going about, he sought some one to lead him by the hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then the proconsul, when he had seen what was done, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, admiring at the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and they that were with him had sailed from <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a>, they came to <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a> in Pamphylia.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But they, passing through <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Antioch in Pisidia</a>: and, entering into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>, they sat down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And after the reading of the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> sent to them, saying: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to make to the people, speak.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> rising up and with his hand bespeaking silence, said: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and you that fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, give ear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">people of Israel</a> chose our fathers and exalted the people when they were sojourners in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: And with an high arm brought them out from thence:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And for the space of forty years endured their manners in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And, destroying seven nations in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, divided their land among them by <a href="../cathen/09366b.htm">lot</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> As it were, after four hundred and fifty years. And after these things, he gave unto them judges, until Samuel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And after that they desired a king: and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">Saul</a> the son of Cis, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>, forty years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when he had removed him, he raised them up <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to be king: to whom giving testimony, he said: I have found <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, the son of Jesse, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to my own heart, who shall do all my wills.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> seed, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to his <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, hath raised up to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> a Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> first preaching, before his coming, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> to all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was fulfilling his course, he said: I am not he whom you think me to be. But behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Men, brethren, children of the stock of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and whosoever among you fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: to you the word of this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is sent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For they that inhabited <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the rulers thereof, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> him, nor the voices of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which are read every <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, judging him, have fulfilled them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And finding no cause of death in him, they desired of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> that they might <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, taking him down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">tree</a>, they laid him in a <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised him up from the dead</a> the third day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Who was seen for many days by them who came up with him from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who to this present are his <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And we declare unto you that the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> which was made to our fathers,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> This same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath fulfilled to our children, raising up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as in the <a href="../douay/psa002.htm">second psalm</a> also is written: Thou art my <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>: this day have I begotten thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And to show that he <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised him up from the dead</a>, not to return now any more to corruption, he said thus: I will give you the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, faithful. <span class="stiki"><strong>I will give you the holy, etc...</strong> These are the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, <a href="../douay/isa055.htm#verse3">55:3</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And therefore, in another place also, he saith: Thou shalt not suffer thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one to see corruption.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, when he had served in his <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, slept: and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But he whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised from the dead</a> saw no corruption.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> In him every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> is <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a>.</span>

<span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And as they went out, they desired them that on the next <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> they would speak unto them these words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> was broken up, many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and of the strangers who served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> followed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> But the next <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>, the whole city almost came together, to hear the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, seeing the multitudes, were filled with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and contradicted those things which were said by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> said boldly: To you it behoved us first to speak the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a>: but because you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, behold we turn to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> For so the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath commanded us: I have set thee to be the light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: that thou mayest be for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unto the utmost part of the earth.</span>
