<div class="h1a">Paul and Barnabas preach in Iconium and Lystra. Paul heals a cripple. They are taken for gods. Paul is stoned. They preach in Derbe and Perge.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a> that they entered together into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and so spoke that a very great multitude both of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and of the Greeks did <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> stirred up and incensed the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> against the brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> A long time therefore they abode there, dealing confidently in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, who gave testimony to the word of his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, granting <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a> to be done by their hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the multitude of the city was divided. And some of them indeed held with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but some with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when there was an assault made by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with their rulers, to use them contumeliously and to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> They, understanding it, fled to <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a> and <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, cities of Lycaonia, and to the whole country round about: and were there preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And there sat a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a>, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> This same heard <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaking. Who looking upon him and seeing that he had <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be healed,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Said with a loud voice: Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when the multitudes had seen what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had done, they lifted up their voice in the Lycaonian tongue, saying: The gods are come down to us in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they called <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, Jupiter: but <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Mercury: because he was chief speaker.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> also of Jupiter that was before the city, bringing oxen and garlands before the gate, would have offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> with the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Which, when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had heard, rending their clothes, they leaped out among the people, crying,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And saying: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, why do ye these things? We also are mortals, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> like unto you, preaching to you to be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> from these vain things to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">made</a> the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Who in times past, suffered all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> to walk in their own ways.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Nevertheless he left not himself without testimony, doing <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And speaking these things, they scarce restrained the people from <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Now there came thither certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>: and, persuading the multitude and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, drew him out of the city, thinking him to be dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But as the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> stood round about him, he rose up and entered into the city: and the next day he departed with <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> to <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when they had preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> to that city and had taught many, they returned again to <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a> and to <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a> and to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Confirming the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and exhorting them to continue in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and that through many tribulations we must enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when they had ordained to them <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in every <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> and had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, they commended them to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, in whom they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And passing through <a href="../cathen/12116b.htm">Pisidia</a>, they came into Pamphylia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And having spoken the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of the Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a>, they went down into <a href="../cathen/02060b.htm">Attalia</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And thence they sailed to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, from whence they had been delivered to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unto the work which they accomplished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when they were come and had assembled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, they related what great things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had done with them and how he had opened the door of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And they abode no small time with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span></p>
