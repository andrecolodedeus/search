<div class="h1a">A dissension about circumcision. The decision and letter of the council of Jerusalem.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">some</a>, coming down from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, taught the brethren: That, except you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you cannot be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> had no small contest with them, they determined that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and certain others of the other side should go up to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, about this question.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> They therefore, being brought on their way by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, passed through Phenice and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, relating the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And they caused great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to all the brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they were come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, they were received by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and ancients, declaring how great things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had done with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But there arose of the sect of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> some that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, saying: They must be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and be commanded to observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and ancients assembled to consider of this matter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when there had been much disputing, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, rising up, said to them: Men, brethren, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in former days <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made choice among us, that by my mouth the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should hear the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> the hearts, gave testimony, giving unto them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as well as to us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now therefore, why <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> you <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to put a yoke upon the necks of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, in like manner as they also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And all the multitude held their peace: and they heard <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> telling what great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had wrought among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And after they had held their peace, <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> answered, saying: Men, brethren, hear me.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And to this agree the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as it is written:</span></p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> That the residue of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may seek after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> upon whom my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is invoked, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who doth these things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> To the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was his own work <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07310a.htm">beginning of the world</a>.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For which cause, judge that they who from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not to be disquieted:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But that we write unto them, that they refrain themselves from the pollutions of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> of old time hath in every city them that preach him in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, where he is read every <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then it pleased the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and ancients, with the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, to choose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of their own company and to send to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, namely, Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Writing</a> by their hands: The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and ancients, brethren, to the brethren of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> that are at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Cilicia, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Forasmuch as we have heard that some going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to whom we gave no commandment:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> It hath seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us, being assembled together, to choose out <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and to send them unto you, with our well beloved <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Men that have given their lives for the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will, by word of mouth, tell you the same things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For it hath seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and to us to lay no further burden upon you than these <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> That you abstain from things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication: from which things keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Fare ye well. <span class="stiki"><strong>From blood, and from things strangled...</strong> The use of these things, though of their own nature indifferent, was here prohibited, to bring the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> more easily to admit of the society of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and to exercise the latter in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. But this prohibition was but temporary, and has long since ceased to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a>; more especially in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">western churches</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> They therefore, being dismissed, went down to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and, gathering together the multitude, delivered the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But Judas and Silas, being <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also themselves, with many words comforted the brethren and confirmed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And after they had spent some time there, they were let go with peace by the brethren unto them that had sent them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto Silas to remain there: and Judas alone departed to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> continued at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, teaching and preaching, with many others, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And after some days, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>: Let us return and visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of the Lord</a>, to see how they do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> would have taken with them <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">John</a> also, that was surnamed Mark.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> desired that he (as having departed from them out of Pamphylia and not gone with them to the work) might not be received.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And there arose a dissension so that they departed one from another.
