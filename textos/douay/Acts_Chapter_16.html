<div class="h1a">Paul visits the churches. He is called to preach in Macedonia. He is scourged at Philippi.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he came to <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a> and <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a>. And behold, there was a certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> there <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Timothy, the son of a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: but his father was a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> To this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> the brethren that were in <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a> and <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a> gave a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> testimony.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Him <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> would have to go along with him: and taking him, he <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> him, because of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were in those places. For they all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that his father was a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And as they passed through the cities, they delivered unto them the decrees for to keep, that were decreed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and ancients who were at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> were confirmed in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and increased in number daily.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when they had passed through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, they were forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a> in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when they were come into Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of Jesus</a> suffered them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when they had passed through Mysia, they went down to <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> was showed to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the night, which was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of Macedonia standing and beseeching him and saying: Pass over into Macedonia and help us.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And as soon as he had seen the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia: being assured that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had called us to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And sailing from <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the day following to Neapolis.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And from thence to <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippi</a>, which is the chief city of part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in this city some days conferring together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And upon the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, we went forth without the gate by a river side, where it seemed that there was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: and sitting down, we spoke to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that were assembled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of <a href="../cathen/14713c.htm">Thyatira</a>, one that <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">worshipped</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did hear: whose heart the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> opened to attend to those things which were said by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when she was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and her household, she besought us, saying: If you have judged me to be faithful to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, come into my house and abide there. And she constrained us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And it came to pass, as we went to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, a certain girl having a pythonical <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirit</a> met us, who brought to her masters much gain by <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divining</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>A pythonical spirit...</strong> That is, a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirit</a> pretending to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divine</a>, and tell fortunes.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> This same following <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and us, cried out, saying: These <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are the servants of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High God</a>, who preach unto you the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And this she did many days. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> being grieved, turned and said to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirit</a>: I command thee, in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus Christ</a>, to <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">go from her</a>. And he went out the same hour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But her masters, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of their gain was gone, apprehending <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas, brought them into the market place to the rulers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And presenting them to the magistrates, they said: These <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> disturb our city, being <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive nor observe, being Romans.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the people ran together against them: and the magistrates, rending off their clothes, commanded them to be beaten with rods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, charging the gaoler to keep them diligently.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And at midnight, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, praised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And they that were in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> heard them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened and the bands of all were loosed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the keeper of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, awakening out of his sleep and seeing the doors of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> open, drawing his sword, would have <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">killed himself</a>, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> cried with a loud voice, saying: Do thyself no harm, for we all are here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then calling for a light, he went in: and trembling, fell down at the feet of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And bringing them out, he said: Masters, what must I do, that I may be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But they said: <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>: and thou shalt be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, and thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of the Lord</a> to him and to all that were in his house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he, taking them the same hour of the night, washed their stripes: and himself was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and all his house immediately.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And when he had brought them into his own house, he laid the table for them: and rejoiced with all his house, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when the day was come, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying: Let those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the keeper of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> told these words to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart. And go in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to them: They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are Romans, and have cast us into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And now do they thrust us out privately? Not so: but let them come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And let us out themselves. And the serjeants told these words to the magistrates. And they were afraid: hearing that they were Romans.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And coming, they besought them: and bringing them out, they desired them to depart out of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they went out of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and entered into the house of Lydia: and having seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed.</span></p>
