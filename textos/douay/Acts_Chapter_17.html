<div class="h1a">Paul preaches to the Thessalonians and Bereans. His discourse to the Athenians.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, where there was a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, according to his custom, went in unto them. And for three <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a> he reasoned with them out of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Declaring and insinuating that the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> was to suffer and to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again from the dead</a>; and that this is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom I preach to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And some of them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and were associated to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas: and of those that served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> a great multitude: and of noble <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> not a few.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, moved with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and taking unto them some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the vulgar sort and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar: and besetting <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason's</a> house, sought to bring them out unto the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And not finding them, they drew <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar are come hither also: <span class="stiki"><strong>City. Urbem...</strong> In the Greek, the world.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Whom <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> hath received. And these all do contrary to the decrees of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>, saying that there is another king, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they stirred up the people: and the rulers of the city, hearing these things,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And having taken satisfaction of <a href="../cathen/08324c.htm">Jason</a> and of the rest, they let them go.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But the brethren immediately sent away <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now these were more noble than those in <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>, whether these things were so. <span class="stiki"><strong>More noble...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Berea are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> commended, for their eagerly embracing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and searching the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>, to find out the texts alleged by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>: which was a far more generous proceeding than that of their countrymen at <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the preachers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, without examining the grounds they alleged for what they taught.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And many indeed of them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: and of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that were <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not a few.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a> was also preached by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And then immediately the brethren sent away <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, to go unto the sea: but Silas and Timothy remained there.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they that conducted <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> brought him as far as <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athens</a>: and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now whilst <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> waited for them at <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athens</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He disputed, therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and with them that served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and in the market place, every day, with them that were there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> disputed with him. And some said: What is it that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods. Because he preached to them <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what this new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is, which thou speakest of?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> therefore what these things mean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> (Now all the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> and strangers that were there employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athens</a>, I perceive that in all things you are too <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For passing by and seeing your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, I found an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> also, on which was written: To the Unknown <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What therefore you <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, that I preach to you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made the world and all things therein, he being Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, dwelleth not in <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> made with hands. <span class="stiki"><strong>Dwelleth not in temples...</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not contained in <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>; so as to need them for his dwelling, or any other uses, as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a>. Yet by his omnipresence, he is both there and everywhere.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Neither is he served with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> hands, as though he needed any thing: seeing it is he who giveth to all <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and breath and all things:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And hath made of one, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times and the limits of their habitation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> That they should seek <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if haply they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For in him we live and move and are: as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Being therefore the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">offspring of God</a>, we must not suppose the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">divinity</a> to be like unto gold or silver or stone, the graving of art and device of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed having winked at the times of this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, now declareth unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that all should every where do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom he hath appointed: giving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to all, by <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raising him up from the dead</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when they had heard of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, some indeed mocked. But others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> So <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> went out from among them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, adhering to him, did <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: among whom was also <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Damaris and others with them.</span></p>
