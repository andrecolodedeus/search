<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things, departing from <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athens</a>, he came to <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And finding a certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/01661b.htm">Aquila</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, lately come from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, with <a href="../cathen/01661b.htm">Priscilla</a> his wife (because that Claudius had commanded all <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to depart from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), he came to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and wrought. (Now they were tentmakers by trade.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he reasoned in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> every <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, bringing in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. And he persuaded the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the Greeks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was earnest in preaching, testifying to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But they gainsaying and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a>, he shook his garments and said to them: Your blood be upon your own heads: I am clean. From henceforth I will go unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And departing thence, he entered into the house of a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Titus Justus, one that <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">worshipped</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose house was adjoining to the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Crispus, the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, with all his house. And many of the <a href="../cathen/04364a.htm">Corinthians</a> hearing, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the night, by a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>: Do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but speak. And hold not thy peace,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Because I am with thee and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall set upon thee, to hurt thee. For I have much people in this city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching among them the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But when Gallio was proconsul of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with one accord rose up against <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and brought him to the judgment seat,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Saying: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> persuadeth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was beginning to open his mouth, Gallio said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: If it were some matter of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> or an heinous deed, O <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, I should with reason bear with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But if they be questions of word and <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> and of your <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, look you to it. I will not be judge of such things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he drove them from the judgment seat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And all laying hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when he had stayed yet many days, taking his leave of the brethren, sailed thence into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (and with him <a href="../cathen/01661b.htm">Priscilla and Aquila</a>), having shorn his head in Cenchrae. For he had a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he came to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> and left them there. But he himself, entering into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, disputed with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when they desired him that he would tarry a longer time, he consented not:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But taking his leave and saying: I will return to you again, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> willing, he departed from <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And going down to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, he went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and saluted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>: and so came down to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And after he had spent some time there, he departed and went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, confirming all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now a certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Apollo, born at <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, an eloquent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, one mighty in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was instructed in the way of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>: and being <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fervent in spirit</a>, spoke and taught diligently the things that are of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> only the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> therefore began to speak boldly in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>. Whom when <a href="../cathen/01661b.htm">Priscilla and Aquila</a> had heard, they took him to them and expounded to him the way of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> more diligently.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And whereas he was desirous to go to <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, the brethren exhorting wrote to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to receive him. Who, when he was come, helped them much who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For with much vigour he convinced the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> openly, showing by the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></p>
