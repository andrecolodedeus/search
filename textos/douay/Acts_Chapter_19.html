<div class="h1a">Paul establishes the Church at Ephesus. The tumult of the silversmiths.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, while Apollo was at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, having passed through the upper coasts, came to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> and found certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said to them: Have you received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> since ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said: In what then were you <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Who said: In <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the people with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> saying: That they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him, who was to come after him, that is to say, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Having heard these things, they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposed his hands</a> on them, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">came upon them</a>: and they <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">spoke with tongues</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were about twelve.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And entering into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, he spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and exhorting concerning the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But when some were hardened and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, speaking <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the way of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And this continued for the space of two years, so that all who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a> heard the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of the Lord</a>, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wrought by the hand of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> more than common <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons: and the diseases departed from them: and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">wicked spirits</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">went out</a> of them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now some also of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, who went about, attempted to invoke over them that had <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, saying: I conjure you by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preacheth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And there were certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, seven sons of Sceva, a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, a chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, that did this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">wicked spirit</a>, answering, said to them: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But who are you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in whom the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">wicked spirit</a> was, leaping upon them and mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And this became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> that dwelt a <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>. And <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> fell on them all: and the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> was magnified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And many of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> came, confessing and declaring their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And many of them who had followed <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">curious arts</a> brought together their books and <a href="../cathen/03519d.htm">burnt them</a> before all. And, counting the price of them, they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So mightily grew the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a> and was confirmed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when these things were ended, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, to go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying: After I have been there, I must see <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Whom he calling together with the workmen of like occupation, said: Sirs, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our gain is by this trade.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And you see and hear that this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, by persuasion hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, but almost of all <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, saying: they are not gods which are made by hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing! Yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a> and the world worshippeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Having heard these things, they were full of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesians</a>!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the whole city was filled with confusion. And having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Macedonia, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> companions, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> would have entered in unto the people, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> suffered him not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And some also of the rulers of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Now some cried one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused: and the greater part <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not for what cause they were come together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they drew forth <a href="../cathen/01285a.htm">Alexander</a> out of the multitude, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> thrusting him forward. And <a href="../cathen/01285a.htm">Alexander</a>, beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But as soon as they perceived him to be a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, all with one voice, for the space of about two hours, cried out: Great is Diana of the <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesians</a>!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is there that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not that the city of the <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesians</a> is a worshipper of the great Diana and of Jupiter's offspring?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> For you have brought hither these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who are neither guilty of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a> nor of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against your goddess.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a matter against any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are open: and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful assembly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> guilty (of whom we may give account) of this concourse. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</span></p>
