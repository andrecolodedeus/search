<h1>Acts Chapter 20</h1>
<div class="h1a">Paul passes through Macedonia and Greece. He raises a dead man to life at Troas. His discourse to the clergy of Ephesus.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after the tumult was ceased, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calling to him the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and exhorting them, took his leave and set forward to go into Macedonia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when he had gone over those parts and had exhorted them with many words, he came into <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Where, when he had spent three months, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. So he took a resolution to return through Macedonia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And there accompanied him Sopater, the son of Pyrrhus, of Berea: and of the <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonians</a>, Aristarchus and Secundus: and Gaius of <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a> and Timothy: and of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15106c.htm">Tychicus</a> and Trophimus.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> These, going before, stayed for us at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But we sailed from <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippi</a> after the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">days of the azymes</a> and came to them to <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> in five days, where we abode seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">first day of the week</a>, when we were <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">assembled</a> to <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">break bread</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> discoursed with them, being to depart on the morrow. And he continued his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">speech</a> until midnight. <span class="stiki"><strong>And on the first day of the week...</strong> Here <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> and many other interpreters of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> explain, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> even at this time, must have changed the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> into the first day of the week, (the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's day</a>), as all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> now keep it. This change was undoubtedly made by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>; hence the exercise of the power, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had given to her: for he is Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And there were a great number of <a href="../cathen/08770a.htm">lamps</a> in the upper chamber where we were <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">assembled</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And a certain young man <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Eutychus, sitting on the window, being oppressed with a deep sleep (as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was long preaching), by occasion of his sleep fell from the third loft down and was taken up dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> To whom, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had gone down, he laid himself upon him and, embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then going up and <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">breaking bread</a> and tasting and having <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">talked</a> a long time to them, until daylight, so he departed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they brought the youth alive and were not a little comforted.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But we going aboard the ship, sailed to Assos, being there to take in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. For so he had appointed, himself purposing to travel by land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when he had met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to <a href="../cathen/10407a.htm">Mitylene</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And sailing thence, the day following we came over against <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a>: and the next day we arrived at <a href="../cathen/13421c.htm">Samos</a>: and the day following we came to <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had determined to sail by <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, lest he should be stayed any time in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>. For he hasted, if it were possible for him, to keep the <a href="../cathen/11661a.htm">day of Pentecost</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And sending from <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a> to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, he called the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when they were come to him and were together, he said to them: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the first day that I came into <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, in what manner I have been with you, for all the time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Serving the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> with all <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and with tears and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> which befell me by the conspiracies of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> How I have kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have preached it to you, and taught you publicly, and from house to house,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Testifying both to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And now, behold, being bound in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, I go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the things which shall befall me there:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Save that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in every city witnesseth to me, saying: That bands and afflictions wait for me at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But I fear none of these things, neither do I count my <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> more precious than myself, so that I may consummate my course and the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> of the word which I received from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, to testify the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And now behold, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all you, among whom I have gone preaching the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, shall see my face no more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Wherefore I take you to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> this day that I am clear from the blood of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For I have not spread to declare unto you all, the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock, wherein the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> hath placed you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which he hath purchased with his own blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that after my departure ravening wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And of your own selves shall arise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> speaking perverse things, to draw away <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Therefore watch, keeping in <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> that for three years I ceased not with tears to admonish every one of you, night and day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And now I commend you to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the word of his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, who is able to build up and to give an inheritance among all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> I have not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> silver, gold or apparel, as</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> You yourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For such things as were needful for me and them that are with me, these hands have furnished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> I have showed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support the weak and to remember the word of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, how he said: It is a more <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> thing to give, rather than to receive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And when he had said these things, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneeling down</a>, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And there was much weeping among them all. And falling on the neck of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, they <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Being grieved most of all for the word which he had said, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him on his way to the ship.</span></p>
