<h1>Acts Chapter 21</h1>
<div class="h1a">Paul goes up to Jerusalem. He is apprehended by the Jews in the temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when it came to pass that, being parted from them, we set sail, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the day following to <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>: and from thence to <a href="../cathen/11541a.htm">Patara</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when we had found a ship sailing over to Phenice, we went aboard and set forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when we had discovered <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and came to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And finding <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, we tarried there seven days: who said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that he should not go up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the days being expired, departing we went forward, they all bringing us on our way, with their wives and children, till we were out of the city. And we <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneeled down</a> on the shore: and we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when we had bid one another farewell, we took ship. And they returned home.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But we, having finished the voyage by sea, from <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> came down to <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Ptolemais</a>: and saluting the brethren, we abode one day with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the next day departing, we came to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>. And entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him. <span class="stiki"><strong>The evangelist...</strong> That is, the preacher of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>; the same that before <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the eunuch (<a href="../douay/act008.htm">Acts 8</a>), being one of the first seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he had four daughters, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who did <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And as we tarried there for some days, there came from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who, when he was come to us, took <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> girdle: and binding his own feet and hands, he said: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose girdle this is, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> shall bind in this manner in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and shall deliver him into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Which when we had heard, both we and they that were of that place desired him that he would not go up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> answered and said: What do you mean, weeping and afflicting my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but to die also in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when we could not persuade him, we ceased, saying: The will of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> be done.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And after those days, being prepared, we went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And there went also with us some of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> from <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, bringing with them one Mnason a <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprian</a>, an old <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, with whom we should lodge.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when we were come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the brethren received us gladly.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the day following, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> went in with us unto <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>: and all the ancients were assembled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Whom when he had saluted, he related particularly what things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had wrought among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But they hearing it, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and said to him: Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: and they are all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now they have heard of thee that thou teachest those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who are among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to depart from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: saying that they ought not to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcise</a> their children, nor walk according to the custom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Do therefore this that we say to thee. We have four <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who have a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> on them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Take these and sanctify thyself with them: and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads. And all will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the things which they have heard of these are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Keeping the law...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, though now no longer <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, was for a time observed by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: to bury, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But, as touching the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, we have written, decreeing that they should only refrain themselves from that which has been offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> took the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and, the next day being purified with them, entered into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, giving notice of the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a> should be offered for every one of them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But when the seven days were drawing to an end, those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, when they saw him in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, stirred up all the people and laid hands upon him, crying out:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Men of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, help: This is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that teacheth all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> everywhere against the people and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> and this place; and moreover hath brought in <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and hath violated this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> (For they had seen Trophimus the <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesian</a> in the city with him, whom they supposed that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had brought into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he whole city was in an uproar: and the people ran together. And taking <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, they drew him out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and immediately the doors were shut.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And as they went about to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him, it was told the tribune of the band that all <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was in confusion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Who, forthwith taking with him soldiers and <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a>, ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they left off beating <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Then the tribune, coming near, took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains: and demanded who he was and what he had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude. And when he could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when he was come to the stairs, it fell out that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For the multitude of the people followed after, crying: Away with him!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was about to be brought into the castle, he saith to the tribune: May I speak something to thee? Who said: Canst thou speak Greek?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Art not thou that <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> who before these days didst raise a tumult and didst lead forth into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> four thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murderers</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to him: I am a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus in Cilicia</a>, a citizen of no mean city. And I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And when he had given him leave, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. And a great silence being made, he spoke unto them in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew tongue</a>, saying:</span></p>
