<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Men, brethren and fathers, hear ye the account which I now give unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> (And when they heard that he spoke to them in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew tongue</a>, they kept the more silence.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he saith: I am a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus in Cilicia</a>, but brought up in this city, at the feet of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, taught according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of the fathers</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, as also all you are this day:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> this way unto death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> As the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> doth bear me witness and all the ancients. From whom also receiving <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to the brethren, I went to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, that I might bring them bound from thence to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to be punished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And it came to pass, as I was going and drawing nigh to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, at mid-day, that suddenly from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> there shone round about me a great light:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And falling on the ground, I heard a voice saying to me: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, why <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutest</a> thou me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I answered: Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me: I am <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, whom thou <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they that were with me saw indeed the light: but they heard not the voice of him that spoke with me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Heard not the voice...</strong> That is, they distinguished not the words; though they heard the voice (<a href="../douay/act009.htm#verse7">Acts 9:7</a>).</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I said: What shall I do, Lord? And the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Arise and go to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>; and there it shall be told thee of all things that thou must do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And whereas I did not see for the brightness of that light, being led by the hand by my companions, I came to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And one Ananias, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, having testimony of all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who dwelt there,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Coming to me and standing by me, said to me: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Brother Saul</a>, look up. And I, the same hour, looked upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But he said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God of our fathers</a> hath preordained thee that thou shouldst <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and see the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Just One</a> and shouldst hear the voice from his mouth. <span class="stiki"><strong>Just One...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a>, who appeared to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../douay/act009.htm#verse17">Acts 9:17</a>).</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For thou shalt be his <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of those things which thou hast seen and heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And now why tarriest thou? Rise up and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and wash away thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, invoking his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And it came to pass, when I was come again to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, that I was in a trance,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And saw him saying unto me: Make haste and get thee quickly out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I said: Lord, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and beat in every <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when the blood of <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen</a> thy <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was shed, I stood by and <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consented</a>: and kept the garments of them that <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he said to me: Go, for unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> afar off will I send thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they heard him until this word and then lifted up their voice, saying: Away with such an one from the earth. For it is not fit that he should live.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And as they cried out and threw off their garments and cast dust into the air,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and that he should be scourged and tortured: to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for what cause they did so cry out against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when they had bound him with thongs, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saith to the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> that stood by him: Is it lawful for you to scourge a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is a Roman and uncondemned?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Which the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> hearing, went to the tribune and told him, saying: What art thou about to do? For this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a Roman citizen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the tribune coming, said to him: Tell me. Art thou a Roman? But he said: Yea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the tribune answered: I obtained the being free of this city with a great sum. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: But I was born so.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Immediately therefore they departed from him that were about to torture him. The tribune also was afraid after he understood that he was a Roman citizen and because he had bound him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But on the next day, meaning to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more diligently for what cause he was accused by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he loosed him and commanded the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to come together and all the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>: and, bringing forth <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, he set him before them.</span></p>
