<div class="h1a">Paul stands before the council. The Jews conspire his death. He is sent away to Cesarea.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, looking upon the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>, said: Men, brethren, I have conversed with all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> until this present day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, Ananias, commanded them that stood by him to strike him on the mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to him: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall strike thee, thou whited wall. For, sittest thou to judge me according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> and, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, commandest me to be struck?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they that stood by said: Dost thou <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">revile</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest of God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, brethren, that he is the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. For it is written: Thou shalt not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the prince of thy people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the one part were <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, cried out in the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>: Men, brethren, I am a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>: concerning the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> and <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> I am called in question.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>. And the multitude was divided.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> say that there is no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> confess both.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And there arose a great cry. And some of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> rising up, strove, saying: We find no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. What if a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> hath spoken to him, or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune, fearing lest <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the night following, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> standing by him, said: Be constant: for as thou hast testified of me in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, so must thou bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> also at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when day was come, some of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gathered together and bound themselves under a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they were more than forty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that had made this conspiracy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Who came to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the ancients and said: We have bound ourselves under a great <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> that we will eat nothing till we have <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now therefore do you with the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a> signify to the tribune, that he bring him forth to you, as if you meant to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something more certain touching him. And we, before he come near, are ready to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> sister's son had heard, of their lying in wait, he came and entered into the castle and told <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, calling to him one of the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a>, said: Bring this young man to the tribune: for he hath some thing to tell him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he, taking him, brought him to the tribune and said: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the prisoner, desired me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath some thing to say to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the tribune, taking him by the hand, went aside with him privately and asked him: What is it that thou hast to tell me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he said: The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldst bring forth <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to-morrow into the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>, as if they meant to inquire some thing more certain touching him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But do not thou give credit to them: for there lie in wait for him more than forty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of them, who have bound themselves by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> neither to eat nor to drink, till they have <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> him. And they are now ready, looking for a promise from thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The tribune therefore dismissed the young man, charging him that he should tell no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he had made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> these things unto him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then having called two <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a>, he said to them: Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>: and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, for the third hour of the night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And provide beasts, that they may set <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> on and bring him safe to Felix the governor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> (For he feared lest perhaps the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> might take him away by force and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him: and he should afterwards be <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>, as if he was to take money.) And he wrote a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> after this manner:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being taken by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and ready to be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> by them, I rescued, coming in with an army, understanding that he is a Roman.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And meaning to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the cause which they objected unto him, I brought him forth into their <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>; but having nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when I was told of ambushes that they had prepared for him, I sent him to thee, signifying also to his accusers to plead before thee. Farewell.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then the soldiers, according as it was commanded them, taking <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, brought him by night to <a href="../cathen/01574c.htm">Antipatris</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the next day, leaving the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the castle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Who, when they were come to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a> and had delivered the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> to the governor, did also present <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And when he had read it and had asked of what province he was and understood that he was of Cilicia:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers come. And he commanded him to be kept in <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> judgment hall.</span></p>
