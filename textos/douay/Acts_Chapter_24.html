<h1>Acts Chapter 24</h1>
<div class="h1a">Paul defends his innocence before Felix the governor. He preaches the faith to him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after five days, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, Ananias, came down with some ancients and one Tertullus, an orator, who went to the governor against <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: Whereas, through thee we live in much peace and many things are rectified by thy <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency to hear us in a few words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> We have found this to be a pestilent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and raising seditions among all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> throughout the world: and author of the sedition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">sect of the Nazarenes</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Who also hath gone about to profane the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: whom, we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But Lysias the tribune, coming upon us with great <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, took him away out of our hands;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Commanding his accusers to come to thee. Of whom thou mayest thyself, by examination, have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all these things whereof we accuse him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also added and said that these things were so.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> answered (the governor making a sign to him to speak): <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> answer for myself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And neither in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> did they find me disputing with any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or causing any concourse of the people: neither in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, nor in the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Neither can they <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But this I confess to thee that according to the way which they call a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, so do I serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">the Father and my God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> all things which are written in the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Having <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And herein do I endeavour to have always a <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> without offence, towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and towards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now after many years, I came to bring <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to my nation and <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> and <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> In which I was found purified in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: neither with multitude nor with tumult.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, who ought to be present before thee and to accuse, if they had anything against me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Or let these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> themselves say if they found in me any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, when standing before the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them: Concerning the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> am I judged this day by you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Felix put them off, having most certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he commanded a <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> to keep him: and that he should be easy and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And after some days, Felix, coming with <a href="../cathen/05165b.htm">Drusilla</a> his wife, who was a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, sent for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and heard of him the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And as he treated of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment to come</a>, Felix, being <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">terrified</a>, answered: For this time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will send for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Hoping also withal that money should be given him by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: for which cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to show the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a pleasure, left <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bound.</span></p>
