<h1>Acts Chapter 25</h1>
<div class="h1a">Paul appeals to Caesar. King Agrippa desires to hear him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days, he went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> from <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and principal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> went unto him against <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: and they besought him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Requesting favour against him, that he would command him to be brought to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, laying wait to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But Festus answered: That <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was kept in <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>: and that he himself would very shortly depart thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are able, go down with me and accuse him, if there be any crime in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days, he went down to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>. And the next day, he sat in the judgment seat and commanded <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be brought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Who being brought, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> stood about him, who were come down from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, objecting many and grievous causes, which they could not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> making answer for himself: Neither against the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of the Jews</a>, nor against the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, nor against <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>, have I offended in any thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But Festus, willing to show the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a pleasure, answering <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, said: Wilt thou go up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and there be judged of these things before me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: I stand at <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a> judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> I have done no injury, as thou very well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For if I have injured them or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may deliver me to them. I appeal to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then Festus, having conferred with the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>, answered: Hast thou appealed to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>? To <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a> shalt thou go.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>, to salute Festus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And as they tarried there many days, Festus told the king of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, saying: A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was left prisoner by Felix.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> About whom, when I was at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> came unto me, desiring condemnation against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> To whom I answered: it is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, before that he who is accused have his accusers present and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the things laid to his charge.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> When therefore they were come hither, without any delay, on the day following, sitting in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of this which I thought ill of:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But had certain questions of their own <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> against him, and of one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> deceased, whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> affirmed to be alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> I therefore being in a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of this manner of question, asked him whether he would go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and there be judged of these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Augustus</a>, I commanded him to be kept, till I might send him to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the man, myself. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp and had entered into the hall of audience with the tribunes and principal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the city, at Festus' commandment, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was brought forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Festus saith: King Agrippa and all ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are here present with us, you see this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, about whom all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> dealt with me at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, requesting and crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Augustus</a>, I have determined to send him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Of whom I have nothing <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> to write to my lord. For which cause, I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, examination being made, I may have what to write.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to signify the things laid to his charge.</span></p>
