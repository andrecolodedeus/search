<div class="h1a">Paul gives an account to Agrippa of his life, conversion and calling.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Agrippa said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I think myself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Especially as thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> all, both customs and questions, that are among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived, a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And now for the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> that was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the fathers, do I stand subject to judgment:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Unto which, our <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">twelve tribes</a>, serving night and day, <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> to come. For which <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, O king, I am accused by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Why should it be thought a thing incredible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raise the dead</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I indeed did formerly think that I ought to do many things contrary to the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus of Nazareth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Which also I did at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and many of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> did I shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, having received authority of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And when they were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, I brought the sentence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And oftentimes punishing them, in every <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, I compelled them to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>: and being yet more mad against them, I <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them even unto foreign cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Whereupon, when I was going to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> with authority and permission of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that were in company with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew tongue</a>: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord answered: I am <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> whom thou <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But rise up and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of those things which thou hast seen and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Delivering thee from the people and from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> unto which now I send thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> To open their eyes, that they may be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> from darkness to light and from the power of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they may receive forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and a lot among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is in me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">heavenly vision</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But to them first that are at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> and at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and unto all the country of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> did I preach, that they should do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> and turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, doing works worthy of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For this cause, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when I was in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, having apprehended me, went about to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But being aided by the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I stand unto this day, <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnessing</a> both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did say should come to pass:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> That <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer and that he should be the first that should <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise from the dead</a> and should show light to the people and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> As he spoke these things and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">mad</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: I am not <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">mad</a>, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and soberness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For the king <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">Believest</a> thou the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, O king Agrippa? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And Agrippa said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: In a little thou persuadest me to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: I would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that both in a little and in much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the king rose up, and the governor and Bernice and they that sat with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And Agrippa said to Festus: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>.
