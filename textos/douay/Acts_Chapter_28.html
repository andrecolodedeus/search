<h1>Acts Chapter 28</h1>
<div class="h1a">Paul, after three months' stay in Melita, continues his voyage and arrives at Rome. His conference there with the Jews.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when we had escaped, then we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the island was called <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Melita</a>. But the barbarians showed us no small courtesy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, because of the present rain and of the cold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had gathered together a bundle of sticks and had laid them on the fire, a viper, coming out of the heat, fastened on his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand, they said one to another: Undoubtedly this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murderer</a>, who, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he indeed, shaking off the beast into the fire, suffered no harm.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But they supposed that he would begin to swell up and that he would suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their minds, they said that he was a god.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now in these places were <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a> of the chief man of the island, named Publius: who, receiving us for three days, entertained us courteously.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux. To whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> entered in. And when he had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laid his hands</a> on him, he healed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Which being done, all that had diseases in the island came and were healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Who also <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> us with many <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a>: and when we were to set sail, they laded us with such things as were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And after three months, we sailed in a ship of <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was the Castors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when we were come to <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracusa</a>, we tarried there three days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> From thence, compassing by the shore, we came to Rhegium: and after one day, the south wind blowing, we came the second day to Puteoli:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Where, finding brethren, we were desired to tarry with them seven days. And so we went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns. Whom when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saw, he gave thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when we were come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was suffered to dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And after the third day, he called together the chief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And when they were assembled, he said to them: Men, brethren, I, having done nothing against the people or the custom of our fathers, was delivered prisoner from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> into the hands of the Romans.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Who, when they had examined me, would have released me, for that there was no cause of death in me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> contradicting it, I was constrained to appeal unto <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>: not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For this cause therefore I desired to see you and to speak to you. Because that for the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">hope of Israel</a>, I am bound with this chain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But they said to him: We neither received <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> concerning thee from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>: neither did any of the brethren that came hither relate or speak any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">this sect</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is every where contradicted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when they had appointed him a day, there came very many to him unto his lodgings. To whom he expounded, testifying the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and persuading them concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, out of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, from morning until evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the things that were said: but some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaking this one word: Well did the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> speak to our fathers by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Saying:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Go to this people and say to them: With the ear you shall hear and shall not understand: and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears have they heard heavily and their eyes they have shut, lest perhaps they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>: and I should heal them.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> therefore to you that this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is sent to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and they will hear it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when he had said these things, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> went out from him, having much reasoning among themselves.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging: and he received all that came in to him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Preaching the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and teaching the things which concern the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with all confidence, without prohibition.</span></p>
