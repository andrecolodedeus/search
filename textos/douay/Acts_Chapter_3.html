<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> went up into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour of prayer</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was lame from his mother's womb was carried: whom they laid every day at the gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, which is called Beautiful, that he might ask <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of them that went into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He, when he had seen <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, about to go into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, asked to receive an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> with <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, fastening his eyes upon him, said: Look upon us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But he looked earnestly upon them, hoping that he should receive something of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said: Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, I give thee. In the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a>, arise and walk.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up: and forthwith his feet and soles received strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he leaping up, stood and walked and went in with them into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, walking and leaping and praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And all the people saw him walking and praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him, that it was he who sat begging <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> at the Beautiful gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And as he held <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, all the people ran to them, to the porch which is called <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a>, greatly wondering.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> seeing, made answer to the people: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, why wonder you at this? Or why look you upon us, as if by our strength or power we had made this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to walk?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, hath <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> his <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, when he judged he should be released.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But you denied the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Holy One and the Just</a>: and desired a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murderer</a> to be granted unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">author of life</a> you <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised from the dead</a>: of which we are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a>, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whom you have seen and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, hath his <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> strengthened. And the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is by him hath given this perfect soundness in the sight of you all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And now, brethren, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you did it through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: as did also your rulers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before had showed by the mouth of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that his <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Be <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penitent</a>, therefore, and be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, that your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be blotted out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> That when the times of refreshment shall come from the presence of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he shall send him who hath been preached unto you, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Whom <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> indeed must receive, until the times of the restitution of all things, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath spoken by the mouth of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, from the beginning of the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shall the <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Lord your God</a> raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me: him you shall hear according to all things whatsoever he shall speak to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And it shall be, that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which will not hear that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shall be destroyed from among the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, from <a href="../cathen/08647b.htm">Samuel</a> and afterwards, who have spoken, have told of these days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> You are the children of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and of the testament which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made to our fathers, saying to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.</span>
