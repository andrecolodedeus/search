<h1>Acts Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">Peter and John are apprehended. Their constancy. The Church is increased.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And as they were speaking to the people the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the officer of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> came upon them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Being grieved that they taught the people and preached in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they laid hands upon them and put them in hold till the next day: for it was now evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But many of them who had heard the word <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: and the number of the men was made five thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their princes and ancients and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> were gathered together in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> and John and <a href="../cathen/01285a.htm">Alexander</a>: and as many as were of the kindred of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And setting them in the midst, they asked: By what power or by what <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, have you done this?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, said to them: Ye princes of the people and ancients, hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If we this day are examined concerning the <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">good deed</a> done to the infirm <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by what means he hath been made whole:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you all and to all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that by the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a>, whom you crucified, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised from the dead</a>, even by him, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> standeth here before you, whole.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> This is the stone which was rejected by you the builders, which is become the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">head of the corner</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Neither is there <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in any other. For there is no other <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whereby we must be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now seeing the constancy of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, understanding that they were illiterate and ignorant <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they wondered: and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them that they had been with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Seeing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also who had been healed, standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But they commanded them to go aside out of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>: and they conferred among themselves,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Saying: What shall we do to these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? For indeed a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> hath been done by them, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It is manifest: and we cannot deny it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But that it may be no farther spread among the people, let us threaten them that they speak no more in this <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And calling them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor teach in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> answering, said to them: If it be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to hear you rather than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, judge ye.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But they, threatening, sent them away, not finding how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> what had been done, in that which had come to pass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was above forty years old, in whom that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cure had been wrought.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And being let go, they came to their own company and related all that the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ancients had said to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Who having heard it, with one accord lifted up their voice to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and said: Lord, thou art he that didst make heaven and earth, the sea and all things that are in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Who, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by the mouth of our father <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, thy servant, hast said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Why did the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> rage: and the people meditate vain things?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> The kings of the earth stood up: and the princes assembled together against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and his <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> there assembled together in this city against thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom thou hast anointed, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> To do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants that with all confidence they may speak thy word,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> By stretching forth thy hand to cures and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a>, to be done by the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when they had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, the place was moved wherein they were assembled: and they were all filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: and they spoke the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with confidence.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the multitude of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believers</a> had but one heart and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Neither did any one say that aught of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> which he possessed was his own: but all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> were common unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And with great power did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> give testimony of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord</a>: and great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was in them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> For neither was there any one <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a> among them. For as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the price of the things they sold,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And laid it down before the feet of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And distribution was made to every one, according as he had need.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And Joseph, who, by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, was surnamed <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> (which is, by interpretation, The son of consolation), a <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprian</a> born,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Having land, sold it and brought the price and laid it at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>.</span></p>
