<div class="h1a">The judgment of God upon Ananias and Saphira. The apostles are cast into prison.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Ananias, with Saphira his wife, sold a piece of land,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> kept back part of the price of the land, his wife being privy thereunto: and bringing a certain part of it, laid it at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said: Ananias, why hath <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> thy heart, that thou shouldst <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> keep part of the price of the land?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Whilst it remained, did it not remain to thee? And after it was sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lied</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a>. And there came great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> upon all that heard it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the young men rising up, removed him, and carrying him out, buried him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what had happened, came in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said to her: Tell me, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whether you sold the land for so much? And she said: Yea, for so much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said unto her: Why have you agreed together to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a>? Behold the feet of them who have buried thy husband are at the door: and they shall carry thee out,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Immediately, she fell down before his feet and gave up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a>. And the young men coming in found her dead: and carried her out and buried her by her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And there came great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> upon the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> and upon all that heard these things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a> wrought among the people. And they were all with one accord in <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a> porch.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But of the rest no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> durst join himself unto them: but the people magnified them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the multitude of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> was more increased:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that, when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> came, his shadow at the least might overshadow any of them and they might be delivered from their infirmities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And there came also together to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a multitude out of the neighbouring cities, bringing sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and such as were troubled with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a>: who were all healed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> rising up, and all they that were with him (which is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>) were filled with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they laid hands on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and put them in the common <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> by night, opening the doors of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and leading them out, said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Go, and standing speak in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> to the people all the words of this life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Who having heard this, early in the morning, entered into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and taught. And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> coming, and they that were with him, called together the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a> and all the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: and they sent to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to have them brought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But when the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> came and opening the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> found them not there, they returned and told,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Saying: The <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> indeed we found shut with all diligence, and the keepers standing before the door: but opening it, we found no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> within.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now when the officer of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> heard these words, they were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning them, what would come to pass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But one came and told them: Behold, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whom you put in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> are in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, standing and teaching the people.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then went the officer with the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and brought them without <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: for they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feared</a> the people, lest they should be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when they had brought them, they set them before the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> asked them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Saying: Commanding, we commanded you that you should not teach in this <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a>. And behold, you have filled <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with your <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>: and you have a mind to bring the blood of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> upon us.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> answering, said: We ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers hath <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised up</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom you <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, hanging him upon a tree.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Him hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exalted with his right hand, to be Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And we are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of these things: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given to all that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> When they had heard these things, they were cut to the heart: and they thought to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But one in the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a> rising up, a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, a doctor of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, respected by all the people, commanded the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be put forth a little while.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he said to them: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do, as touching these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For before these days rose up Theodas, affirming himself to be somebody, to whom a number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, about four hundred, joined themselves. Who was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a>: and all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him were scattered and brought to nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> After this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the enrolling, and drew away the people after him. He also perished: and all, even as many as consented to him, were dispersed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And now, therefore, I say to you: Refrain from these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and let them alone. For if this council or this work be of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, it will come to nought:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But if it be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And they consented to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And calling in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, after they had scourged them, they charged them that they should not speak at all in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>. And they dismissed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And they indeed went from the presence of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a>, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And every day they ceased not, in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and from house to house, to teach and preach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span></p>
