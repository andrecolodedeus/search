<div class="h1a">Stephen's speech before the council. His martyrdom.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> said: Are these things so?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Who said: Ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, brethren and fathers, hear. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> appeared to our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And said to him: Go forth out of thy country and from thy kindred: and come into the land which I shall show thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then he went out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Charan. And from thence, after his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he gave him no inheritance in it: no, not the pace of a foot. But he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to give it him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to him: That his seed should sojourn in a strange country, and that they should bring them under <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a> and treat them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> four hundred years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the nation which they shall serve will I judge (said the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>): and after these things they shall go out and shall serve me in this place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he gave him the covenant of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. And so he begot <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> him the eighth day: and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> begot <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, the twelve <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarchs</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarchs</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, sold <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was with him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And delivered him out of all his tribulations: and he gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And he appointed him governor over <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and over all his house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now there came a famine upon all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and great tribulation: and our fathers found no food.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But when <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> had heard that there was corn in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he sent our fathers first.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And at the second time, <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his brethren: and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a> was made known to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> sending, called thither <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, his father, and all his kindred, seventy-five <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And he died, and our fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they were translated into <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a> and were laid in the sepulchre that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hemor, the son of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when the time of the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> drew near, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the people increased and were multiplied in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Till another <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a> arose in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> This same, dealing craftily with our race, afflicted our fathers, that they should expose their children, to the end they might not be kept alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> At the same time was <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> born: and he was acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Who was nourished three months in his father's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when he was exposed, <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was instructed in all the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>: and he was mighty in his words and in his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when he had seen one of them suffer wrong, he defended him: and striking the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, he avenged him who suffered the injury.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he thought that his brethren understood that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his hand would save them. But they understood it not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the day following, he showed himself to them when they were at strife and would have reconciled them in peace, saying: Men, ye are brethren. Why hurt you one another?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But he that did the injury to his neighbour thrust him away, saying: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> What! Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> fled upon this word: and was a stranger in the land of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, where he begot two sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him, in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount Sina</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in a flame of fire in a bush.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> seeing it wondered at the sight. And as he drew near to view it, the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">voice of the Lord</a> came unto him, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of thy fathers: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> being <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">terrified</a> durst not behold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place wherein thou standest is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Seeing, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and I have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them. And now come: and I will send thee into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> This <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whom they refused, saying: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge? Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent to be prince and redeemer, by the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who appeared to him in the burning bush.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> He brought them out, doing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonders and signs</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, forty years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> This is that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who said to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: A <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">prophet</a> shall <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> raise up to you of your own brethren, as myself.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Whom our fathers would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>: but thrust him away and in their hearts turned back into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Saying to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: Make us gods to go before us.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And they made a <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">calf</a> in those days and offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</span>
