<div class="h1a">Philip converts the Samaritans and baptizes the eunuch.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And at that time, there was raised a great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> which was at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. And they were all dispersed through the countries of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, except the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And devout <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> took order for <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen's</a> funeral and made great mourning over him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a> made havock of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, entering in from house to house: and dragging away men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, committed them to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> They therefore that were <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">dispersed</a> went about preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>, going down to the city of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, preached <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>, hearing, and seeing the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he did.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For many of them who had <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a>, crying with a loud voice, went out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> There was therefore great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in that city. Now there was a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, giving out that he was some great one:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is called great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But when they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> preaching of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus Christ</a>, they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> also and, being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he adhered to <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which were done.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now, when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who were in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, had heard that <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> had received the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of God</a>, they sent unto them <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Who, when they were come, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them that they might receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For he was not as yet come upon any of them: but they were only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then they <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laid their hands</a> upon them: and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>They laid their hands upon them, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> administered the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of confirmation</a>, by <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> thereby received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Not but they had received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> at their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: yet not that plenitude of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and those <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">spiritual gifts</a> which they afterwards received from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">sacrament of confirmation</a>, which strengthened them to profess their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> publicly.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> saw that, by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of the hands</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given, he <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">offered them money</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">lay my hands</a>, he may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee: because thou hast thought that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">gift of God</a> may be <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">purchased with money</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> therefore for this thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> answering, said: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> you for me to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they indeed, having testified and preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of the Lord</a>, returned to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> to many countries of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Now an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> into <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>: this is <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And rising up, he went. And behold, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, an eunuch, of great authority under <a href="../cathen/03244c.htm">Candace the queen of the Ethiopians</a>, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he was returning, sitting in his chariot and reading <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>: Go near and join thyself to this chariot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> running thither, heard him reading the <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">prophet Isaias</a>. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Who said: And how can I, unless some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> show me? And he desired <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> that he would come up and sit with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the place of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> which he was reading was this:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> He was led as a sheep to the slaughter: and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> In <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> his judgment was taken away. His <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the eunuch answering <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speak this? Of himself, or of some other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>, opening his mouth and beginning at this <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>, preached unto him <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water. And the eunuch said: See, here is water: What doth hinder me from being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> said: If thou <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believest</a> with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>If thou believest with all thy heart...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> many times mentions only one disposition, as here <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, when others equally necessary are not expressed, viz., a sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, a firm <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> with the whole heart signifies a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of every thing necessary for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And they went down into the water, both <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> and the eunuch. And he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And when they were come up out of the water, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> took away <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>: and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> was found in <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>: and passing through, he preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> to all the cities, till he came to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a>.</span></p>
