<div class="h1a">Paul's conversion and zeal. Peter heals Eneas and raises up Tabitha to life.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, went to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And asked of him <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>: that if he found any men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of this way, he might bring them bound to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And as he went on his journey, it came to pass that he drew nigh to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>. And suddenly a light from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shined round about him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>, why <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutest</a> thou me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Who said: Who art thou, Lord? And he: I am <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> whom thou <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutest</a>. It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he, trembling and astonished, said: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Arise and go into the city; and there it shall be told thee what thou must do. Now the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who went in company with him stood amazed, hearing indeed a voice but seeing no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a> arose from the ground: and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. But they, leading him by the hands, brought him to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he was there three days without sight: and he did neither eat nor drink.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now there was a certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Ananias. And the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> said to him in a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>: Ananias, And he said: Behold I am here, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Arise and go into the street that is called Strait and seek in the house of Judas, one <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul of Tarsus</a>. For behold he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayeth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> (And he saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Ananias coming in and <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">putting his hands upon him</a>, that he might receive his sight.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But Ananias answered: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, I have heard by many of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, how much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he hath done to thy <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And here he hath authority from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to bind all that invoke thy <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Go thy way: for this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is to me a vessel of election, to carry my <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and kings and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name's</a> sake.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Ananias went his way and entered into the house. And laying his hands upon him, he said: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Brother Saul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> hath sent me, he that appeared to thee in the way as thou camest, that thou mayest receive thy sight and be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales: and he received his sight. And rising up, he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when he had taken meat, he was strengthened. And he was with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that were at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, for some days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And immediately he preached <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, that he is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And all that heard him were astonished and said: Is not this he who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> those that called upon this <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> and came hither for that intent, that he might carry them bound to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a> increased much more in strength and confounded the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who dwelt at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, affirming that this is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when many days were passed, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> consulted together to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But their lying in wait was made known to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a>. And they watched the gates also day and night, that they might <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, taking him in the night, conveyed him away by the wall, letting him down in a basket.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when he was come into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he essayed to join himself to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: and they all were <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a> of him, not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that he was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> took him and brought him to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and told them how he had <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">seen</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and that he had spoken to him: and how in <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> he had dealt confidently in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he was with them, coming in and going out in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and dealing confidently in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> He spoke also to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and disputed with the Greeks. But they sought to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Which when the brethren had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, they brought him down to <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">Caesarea</a> and sent him away to <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Now, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> had peace throughout all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: and was edified, walking in the fear of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and was filled with the consolation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And it came to pass that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, as he passed through, visiting all, came to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who dwelt at <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he found there a certain man <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Eneas, who had kept his bed for eight years, who was ill of the palsy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said to him: Eneas, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> healeth thee. Arise and make thy bed. And immediately he arose.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And all that dwelt at <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a> and Saron saw him: who were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And in <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> there was a certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Tabitha, which by interpretation is called <em>Dorcas</em>. This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was full of good works and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> which she did.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died. Whom when they had washed, they <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">laid her</a> in an upper chamber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And forasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a> was nigh to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, hearing that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was there, sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not be slack to come unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> rising up went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> stood about him, weeping and showing him the coats and garments which Dorcas made them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they all being put forth, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneeling</a> down, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. And turning to the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes and, seeing <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, sat up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And giving her his hand, he lifted her up. And when he had called the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, he presented her alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And it was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> throughout all <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>. And many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And it came to pass that he abode many days in <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, with one Simon a tanner.</span></p>
