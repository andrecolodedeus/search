<div class="h1a">The epistle of Jeremiah to the captives, as a preservative against idolatry.</div>

<p><em>A copy of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> that <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremias</a> sent to them that were to be led away <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captives</a> into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, to declare to them according to what was commanded him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</em>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that you have committed before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you shall be carried away <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captives</a> into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> by <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when you are come into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, you shall be there many years, and for a long time, even to seven <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>: and after that I will bring you away from thence with peace. <span class="stiki"><strong>Seven generations...</strong> That is, seventy years.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But now, you shall see in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> gods of gold, and of silver, and of stone, and of wood borne upon shoulders, causing fear to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others, and be afraid, and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of them should seize upon you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But when you see the multitude behind, and before, adoring them, say you in your hearts: Thou oughtest to be <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is with you: And I myself will demand an account of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For their tongue that is polished by the craftsman, and themselves laid over with gold and silver, are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> things, and they cannot speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And as if it were for a maiden that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> to go gay: so do they take gold and make them up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Their gods have golden crowns upon their heads: whereof the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> secretly convey away from them gold, and silver, and bestow it on themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Yea and they give thereof to prostitutes, and they dress out harlots: and again when they receive it of the harlots, they adorn their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And these <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> cannot defend themselves from the rust, and the moth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But when they have covered them with a purple garment, they wipe their face because of the dust of the house, which is very much among them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> This holdeth a sceptre as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as a judge of the country, but cannot <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> one that offendeth him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And this hath in his hand a sword, or an axe, but cannot save himself from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, or from robbers, whereby be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, that they are not gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them not. For as a vessel that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> uses when it is broken becometh useless, even so are their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> When they are placed in the house, their eyes are full of dust by the feet of them that go in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And as the gates are made sure on every side upon one that hath offended the king, or like a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> carried to the grave, so do the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> secure the doors with bars and locks, lest they be stripped by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thieves</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> They light candles to them, and in great number, of which they cannot see one: but they are like beams in the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they say that the creeping things which are of the earth, gnaw their hearts, while they eat them and their garments, and they feel it not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Their faces are black with the smoke that is made in the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Owls, and swallows, and other birds fly upon their bodies, and upon their heads, and cats in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Whereby you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are no gods. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them not.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The gold also which they have, is for show, but except a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were molten, did they feel it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Men</a> buy them at a high price, whereas there is no breath in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And having not the use of feet they are carried upon shoulders, declaring to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> how vile they are. Be they confounded also that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Therefore if they fall to the ground, they rise not up again of themselves, nor if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> set them upright, will they stand by themselves, but their gifts shall be set before them, as to the dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> The things that are <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to them, their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sell and abuse: in like manner also their wives take part of them, but give nothing of it either to the sick, or to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> The childbearing and menstruous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> touch their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, therefore, by these things that they are not gods, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For how can they be called gods? because <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> set <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> before the gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sit in their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, having their garments rent, and their heads and <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beards</a> shaven, and nothing upon their heads.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And they roar and cry before their gods, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do at the feast when one is dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> take away their garments, and clothe their wives and their children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And whether it be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that one doth unto them, or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, they are not able to recompense it: neither can they set up a king, nor put him down:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> In like manner they can neither give <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, nor requite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> make a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to them, and perform it not: they cannot require it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> They cannot deliver a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from death, nor save the weak from the mighty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> They cannot restore the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his sight: nor deliver a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from distress.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> They shall not pity the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, nor do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">fatherless</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Their gods, of wood, and of stone, and of gold, and of silver, are like the stones that are hewn out of the mountains: and they that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> them shall be confounded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> How then is it to be supposed, or to be said, that they are gods?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Even the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldeans</a> themselves dishonor them: who when they hear of one dumb that cannot speak, they present him to Bel, entreating him, that he may speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> As though they could be sensible that have no motion themselves: and they, when they shall perceive this, will leave them: for their gods themselves have no sense.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also, with cords about them, sit in the ways, burning olive-stones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And when any one of them, drawn away by some passenger, lieth with him, she upbraideth her neighbor, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> But all things that are done about them, are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: how is it then to be thought, or to be said, that they are gods?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And they are made by workmen, and by goldsmiths. They shall be nothing else but what the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> will have them to be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> For the artificers themselves that make them, are of no long continuance. Can those things then that are made by them, be gods?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> But they have left <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> things and reproach to them that come after.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> For when <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> cometh upon them, or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> consult with themselves, where they may hide themselves with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> How then can they be thought to be gods, that can neither deliver themselves from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, nor save themselves from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> For seeing they are but of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, it shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> hereafter that they are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> things, by all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and kings: and it shall be manifest that they are no gods, but the work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> hands, and that there is no work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> Whence, therefore, is it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that they are not gods, but the work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> hands, and no work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> They cannot set up a king over the land, nor give rain to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> They determine no causes, nor deliver countries from oppression: because they can do nothing, and are as daws between heaven and earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> For when fire shall fall upon the house of these gods of wood, and of silver, and of gold, their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> indeed will flee away, and be saved: but they themselves shall be burnt in the midst like beams.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And they cannot withstand a king and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. How then can it be supposed, or admitted, that they are gods?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Neither are these gods of wood, and of stone, and laid over with gold, and with silver, able to deliver themselves from <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thieves</a> or robbers: they that are stronger than them, <span class="stiki"><strong>They that are stronger than them...</strong> That is, robbers and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thieves</a> are stronger than these <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, being things without <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> or motion.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> Shall take from them the gold, and silver, and the raiment wherewith they are clothed, and shall go their way, neither shall they help themselves.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> Therefore it is better to be a king that showeth his power: or else a profitable vessel in the house, with which the owner thereof will be well satisfied: or a door in the house, to keep things safe that are therein, than such <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">false gods</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> The sun, and the moon, and the stars being bright, and sent forth for profitable uses, are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> In like manner the lightning, when it breaketh forth, is easy to be seen: and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And the clouds, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commandeth them to go over the whole world, do that which is commanded them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> The fire also being sent from above to consume mountains, and woods, doth as it is commanded. But these neither in show, nor in power, are alike to any one of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> Wherefore it is neither to be thought, nor to be said, that they are gods: since they are neither able to judge causes, nor to do any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>, therefore, that they are not gods, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> For neither can they <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> kings, nor <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> Neither do they show signs in the heaven to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> Beasts are better than they, which can fly under a covert, and help themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> Therefore there is no manner of appearance that they are gods: so <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them not.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing, so are their gods of wood, and of silver, and laid over with gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse70">70</span> They are no better than a white thorn in a garden, upon which every bird sitteth. In like manner also their gods of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, are like to a dead body cast forth in the dark.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse71">71</span> By the purple also and the scarlet which are motheaten upon them, you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are not gods. And they themselves at last are consumed, and shall be a reproach in the country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse72">72</span> Better, therefore, is the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that hath no <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: for he shall be far from reproach.</span></p>
