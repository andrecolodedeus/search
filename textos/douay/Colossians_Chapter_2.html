<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> For I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what manner of care I have for you and for them that are at <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> and whosoever have not seen my face in the flesh:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> That their hearts may be comforted, being instructed in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and unto all riches of fulness of understanding, unto the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now this I say, that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may deceive you by loftiness of words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For though I be absent in body, yet in spirit I am with you, rejoicing, and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> As therefore you have received <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ the Lord</a>, walk ye in him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as also you have learned: abounding in him in thanksgiving.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Beware lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cheat you by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>: according to the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> according to the elements of the world and not according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> corporeally.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And despoiling the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">principalities and powers</a>, he hath exposed them confidently in open show, triumphing over them in himself.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a festival day or of the new moon or of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, <span class="stiki"><strong>In meat, etc...</strong> He means with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> observations of the distinction of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean and unclean</a> meats; and of their festivals, new moons, and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, as being no longer <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>.</span></span>

Such was the worship, that many of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> (against whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks in <a href="../douay/col002.htm#verse8">verse 8</a>) paid to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to them, as carriers of intelligence betwixt <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; pretending <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> in so doing, as if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was too great to be addressed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and setting aside the <a href="../cathen/10118a.htm">mediatorship</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is the head both of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Such also was the worship paid by the ancient <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon</a> and Menander, to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whom they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be makers and lords of this lower world. This is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, that they whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> here condemns, did not hold the head (<a href="../douay/col002.htm#verse19">verse 19</a>), that is, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/10118a.htm">mediatorship</a>; and therefore what he writes here no way touches the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and practice, of desiring our <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">good angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for us, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> [Epist. ad Algas.] understands by the religion or service of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Jewish teachers</a>, who sought to subject the new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And not holding the head, from which the whole body, by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth into the increase of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> If then you be dead with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the elements of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Touch not: taste not: handle not. <span class="stiki"><strong>Touch not, etc...</strong> The meaning is, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should not subject themselves, either to the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">old law</a>, forbidding touching or tasting things <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>; or to the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> invention of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, imposing such restraints, under pretence of wisdom, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, or mortification.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> and doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and not sparing the body; not in any <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the filling of the flesh.</span></p>
