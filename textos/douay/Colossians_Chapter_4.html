<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when this <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> shall have been read with you, cause that it be read also in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodiceans</a>: and that you read that which is of the <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodiceans</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>And that you read that which is of the Laodiceans...</strong> What this <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> was is uncertain, and annotators have given different opinions concerning it. Some expound these words of an <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote to the <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodiceans</a>, and is since lost, for that now extant is no more than a collection of sentences out of the other <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; therefore it cannot be considered even as a part of that <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a>. Others explain that the text means a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodiceans</a>, which he sends to the <a href="../cathen/04131a.htm">Colossians</a> to be read by them. However, this opinion does not seem well founded. Hence it is more probable that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote an <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodiceans</a>, about the same time that he wrote to the <a href="../cathen/04131a.htm">Colossians</a>, as he had them both equally at heart, and that he ordered that <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> to be read by the <a href="../cathen/04131a.htm">Colossians</a> for their instructions; and being neighbouring cities, they might communicate to each other what they had received from him; as one <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> might contain some matters not related in the other, and would be equally useful for their concern; and more particularly as they were equally disturbed by intruders and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> teachers, against which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> was anxious to warn them, lest they should be infected by their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">pernicious doctrine</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And say to Archippus: Take heed to the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> which thou hast received in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that thou fulfil it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The salutation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with my own hand. Be mindful of my bands. <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> be with you. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
