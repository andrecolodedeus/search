<h1>Daniel</h1>

<p><a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">DANIEL</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> signifies <em>The Judgment of God</em>, was of the royal blood of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and one of those that were first of all carried away into <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>. He was so renowned for wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that it became a proverb among the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>, <em>As Wise as Daniel</em> (<a href="../douay/eze023.htm#verse3">Ezekiel 23:3</a>). And his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> was so great from his very childhood, that at the time when he was as yet but a young man, he is joined by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> with <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Job</a>, as three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> most eminent for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, <a href="../douay/eze014.htm">Ezekiel 14</a>. He is not commonly numbered by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a> among <em>The Prophets</em>: because he lived at <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and in high station in the world: but if we consider his many clear predictions of things to come, we shall find that no one better deserves the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and title of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: which also has been given him by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Son of God</a> himself in <a href="../douay/mat024.htm">Matthew 24</a>, <a href="../douay/mar013.htm">Mark 13</a> and <a href="../douay/luk021.htm">Luke 21</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">DANIEL</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/dan001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> Daniel and his companions are taken into the palace of the king of Babylon: they abstain from his meat and wine, and succeed better with pulse and water. Their excellence and wisdom.
<br><a href="../douay/dan002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> Daniel, by divine revelation, declares the dream of Nabuchodonosor, and the interpretation of it. He is highly honoured by the king.
<br><a href="../douay/dan003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> Nabuchodonosor set up a golden statue; which he commands all to adore: the three children for refusing to do it are cast into the fiery furnace; but are not hurt by the flames. Their prayer and canticle of praise.
<br><a href="../douay/dan004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Nabuchodonosor's dream, by which the judgments of God are denounced against him for his pride, is interpreted by Daniel, and verified by the event.
<br><a href="../douay/dan005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> Baltasar's profane banquet: his sentence is denounced by a handwriting on the wall, which Daniel reads and interprets.
<br><a href="../douay/dan006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> Daniel is promoted by Darius: his enemies procure a law forbidding prayer; for the transgression of this law Daniel is cast into the lions' den: but miraculously delivered.
<br><a href="../douay/dan007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> Daniel's vision of the four beasts, signifying four kingdoms: of God sitting on his throne: and of the opposite kingdoms of Christ and Antichrist.
<br><a href="../douay/dan008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> Daniel's vision of the ram and the he goat interpreted by the angel Gabriel.
<br><a href="../douay/dan009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> Daniel's confession and prayer: Gabriel informs him concerning the seventy weeks to the coming of Christ.
<br><a href="../douay/dan010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> Daniel having humbled himself by fasting and penance seeth a vision, with which he is much terrified; but he is comforted by an angel.
<br><a href="../douay/dan011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> The angel declares to Daniel many things to come, with regard to the Persian and Grecian kings: more especially with regard to Antiochus as a figure of Antichrist.
<br><a href="../douay/dan012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> Michael shall stand up for the people of God: with other things relating to Antichrist, and the end of the world.
<br><a href="../douay/dan013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> The history of Susanna and the two elders.
<br><a href="../douay/dan014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> The history of Bel, and of the great serpent worshipped by the Babylonians.
