<h1>Daniel Chapter 1</h1>
<div class="h1a">Daniel and his companions are taken into the palace of the king of Babylon: they abstain from his meat and wine, and succeed better with pulse and water. Their excellence and wisdom.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the third year of the reign of Joakim, king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and besieged it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered into his hands Joakim, the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and part of the vessels of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>: and he carried them away into the land of Sennaar, to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure house of his god. <span class="stiki"><strong>His god...</strong> Bel or Belus, the principal <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldeans</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king spoke to Asphenez, the master of the eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and of the king's seed, and of the princes,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Children in whom there was no blemish, well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, acute in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and instructed in science, and such as might stand in the king's palace, that he might teach them the learning, and the tongue of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldeans</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the king appointed them a daily provision, of his own meat, and of the wine of which he drank himself, that being nourished three years, afterwards they might stand before the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now there was among them of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a>, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the master of the eunuchs gave them <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>: to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, Baltassar: to Ananias, Sidrach: to Misael, Misach: and to Azarias, Abdenago.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with the king's table, nor with the wine which he drank: and he requested the master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled. <span class="stiki"><strong>Be defiled, etc...</strong> Viz., either by eating meat forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, or which had before been offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the prince of the eunuchs said to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>: I fear my lord, the king, who hath appointed you meat and drink: who if he should see your faces leaner than those of the other youths, your equals, you shall endanger my head to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> said to Malasar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Try, I beseech thee, thy servants for ten days, and let pulse be given us to eat, and water to drink: <span class="stiki"><strong>Pulse...</strong> That is, peas, beans, and such like.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And look upon our faces, and the faces of the children that eat of the king's meat: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when he had heard these words, he tried them for ten days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And after ten days, their faces appeared fairer and fatter than all the children that ate of the king's meat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So Malasar took their portions, and the wine that they should drink: and he gave them pulse.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And to these children <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and understanding in every book, and wisdom: but to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> the understanding also of all <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> and <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dreams</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when the days were ended, after which the king had ordered they should be brought in: the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when the king had spoken to them, there were not found among them all such as <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias: and they stood in the king's presence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, and wise men, that were in all his kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.</span></p>
