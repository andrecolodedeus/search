<h1>Daniel Chapter 10</h1>
<div class="h1a">Daniel having humbled himself by fasting and penance sees a vision, with which he is much terrified; but he is comforted by an angel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the third year of Cyrus, king of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, a word was <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, surnamed Baltassar, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> word, and great strength: and he understood the word: for there is need of understanding in a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> In those days I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, mourned the days of three weeks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> I <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">ate no desirable bread</a>, and neither flesh, nor wine, entered into my mouth, neither was I anointed with <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>: till the days of three weeks were accomplished.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, I was by the great river, which is the Tigris.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw: and behold a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with the finest gold:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And his body was like the chrysolite, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as a burning lamp: and his arms, and all downward even to the feet, like in appearance to glittering brass: and the voice of his word like the voice of a multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> alone, saw the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with me saw it not: but an exceeding great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">terror</a> fell upon them, and they fled away, and hid themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I, being left alone, saw this great <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>: and there remained no strength in me, and the appearance of my countenance was changed in me, and I fainted away, and retained no strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard I lay in a consternation upon my face, and my face was close to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And behold a hand touched me, and lifted me up upon my knees, and upon the joints of my hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, thou <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of desires, understand the words that I speak to thee, and stand upright: for I am sent now to thee. And when he had said this word to me, I stood trembling.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">Fear</a> not, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the sight of thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thy words have been heard: and I am come for thy words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But the prince of the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> resisted me one and twenty days: and behold <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Michael</a>, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The prince, etc...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">angel guardian</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>: who according to his office, seeking the spiritual <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> was desirous that many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> should remain among them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But I am come to teach thee what things shall befall thy people in the latter days, for as yet the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> is for days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when he was speaking such words to me, I cast down my countenance to the ground, and held my peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And behold as it were the likeness of a <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> touched my lips: then I opened my mouth and spoke, and said to him that stood before me: O my lord, at the sight of thee my joints are loosed, and no strength hath remained in me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord? for no strength remaineth in me; moreover, my breath is stopped.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore, he that looked like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, touched me again, and strengthened me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he said: Fear not, O <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of desires, peace be to thee: take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and be strong. And when he spoke to me, I grew strong, and I said: Speak, O my lord, for thou hast strengthened me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he said: Dost thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> wherefore I am come to thee? And now I will return, to fight against the prince of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. When I went forth, there appeared the prince of the <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greeks</a> coming.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But I will tell thee what is set down in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and none is my helper in all these things, but <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Michael your prince</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Michael your prince...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian</a> general of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of God</a>.</span></span></p>
