<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But at that time shall <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Michael</a> rise up, the great prince, who standeth for the children of thy people: and a time shall come, such as never was from the time that nations began, even until that time. And at that time shall thy people be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, every one that shall be found written in the book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">awake</a>: some unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">life everlasting</a>, and others unto <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">reproach</a>, to see it always.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But they that are learned, shall shine as the brightness of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>: and they that instruct many to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stars for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Learned...</strong> Viz., in the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, which consists in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But thou, O <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time appointed: many shall pass over, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> shall be manifold.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, looked, and behold as it were two others stood: one on this side upon the bank of the river, and another on that side, on the other bank of the river.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was clothed in linen, that stood upon the waters of the river: How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I heard the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was clothed in linen, that stood upon the waters of the river, when he had lifted up his right hand, and his left hand to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and had sworn by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">him that liveth for ever</a>, that it should be unto a time, and times, and half a time. And when the <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattering of the band of the holy people</a> shall be accomplished, all these things shall be finished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I heard, and understood not. And I said: O my lord, what shall be after these things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said: Go, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, because the words are shut up, and sealed until the appointed time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Many shall be chosen, and made white, and shall be tried as fire: and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall deal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>, and none of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall understand, but the learned shall understand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And from the time when the continual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> shall be taken away, and the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination unto desolation</a> shall be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred ninety days.</span>
