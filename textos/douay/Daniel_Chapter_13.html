<h1>Daniel Chapter 13</h1>
<div class="h1a">The history of Susanna and the two elders.</div>

<p><span class="stiki">This history of Susanna, in all the ancient <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Greek</a> and Latin Bibles, was placed in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">book of Daniel</a>: till <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, in his translation, detached it from thence; because he did not find it in the <a href="../cathen/07175a.htm">Hebrew</a>: which is also the case of the history of <a href="../douay/dan012.htm">Bel and the Dragon</a>. But both the one and the other are received by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: and were from the very beginning a part of the <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">Christian Bible</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that dwelt in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Joakim:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he took a wife, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Susanna, the daughter of Helcias, a very beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and one that feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> being <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, had instructed their daughter according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now Joakim was very <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a>, and had an orchard near his house: and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> resorted to him, because he was the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> of them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And there were two of the ancients of the people appointed judges that year, of whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: That <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> came out from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, from the ancient judges, that seemed to govern the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> These <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> frequented the house of Joakim, and all that hand any maters of judgment came to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went in, and walked in her husband's orchard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> saw her going in every day, and walking: and they were inflamed with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> towards her:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they perverted their own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and turned away their eyes, that they might not look unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, nor remember <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> judgments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So they were both wounded with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of her, yet they did not make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> their grief one to the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For they were ashamed to declare to one another their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, being desirous to have to do with her:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they watched carefully every day to see her. And one said to the other:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Let us now go home, for it is dinner time. So going out, they departed one from another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And turning back again, they came both to the same place: and asking one another the cause, they acknowledged their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: and then they agreed together upon a time, when they might find her alone.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it fell out, as they watched a fit day, she went in on a time, as yesterday and the day before, with two maids only, and was desirous to wash herself in the orchard: for it was hot weather.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And there was nobody there, but the two old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that had hid themselves, and were beholding her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So she said to the maids: Bring me oil, and washing balls, and shut the doors of the orchard, that I may wash me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they did as she bade them: and they shut the doors of the orchard, and went out by a back door to fetch what she had commanded them, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that the elders were hid within.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders arose, and ran to her, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Behold the doors of the orchard are shut, and nobody seeth us, and we are in love with thee: wherefore consent to us, and lie with us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But if thou wilt not, we will bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against thee, that a young man was with thee, and therefore thou didst send away thy maids form thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Susanna sighed, and said: I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is death to me: and if I do it not, I shall not escape your hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But it is better for me to fall into your hands without doing it, than to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> With that Susanna cried out with a loud voice: and the elders also cried out against her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And one of them ran to the door of the orchard, and opened it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the orchard, they rushed in by the back door, to see what was the matter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But after the old men had spoken, the servants were greatly ashamed: for never had there been any such word said of Susanna. And on the next day,</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> When the people were come to Joakim, her husband, the two elders also came full of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> device against Susanna, to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put her to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they said before the people: Send to Susanna, daughter of Helcias, the wife of Joakim. And presently they sent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And she came with her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and children and all her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Now Susanna was exceeding delicate, and beautiful to behold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men commanded that her face should be uncovered, (for she was covered) that so at least they might be satisfied with her beauty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Therefore her friends, and all her acquaintance wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But the two elders rising up in the midst of the people, <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laid their hands</a> upon her head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And she weeping, looked up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, for her heart had confidence in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the elders said: As we walked in the orchard alone, this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> came in with two maids, and shut the doors of the orchard, and sent away the maids from her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Then a young man that was there hid came to her, and lay with her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But we that were in a corner of the orchard, seeing this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, ran up to them, and we saw them lie together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And him indeed we could not take, because he was stronger than us, and opening the doors, he leaped out:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But having taken this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: of this thing we are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> The multitude <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them, as being the elders, and the judges of the people, and they condemned her to death.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said: O <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> hidden things, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> all things before they come to pass,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> that they have borne <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against me: and behold I must <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">die</a>, whereas I have done none of these things, which these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">maliciously</a> forged against me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard her voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And when she was led to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> raised up the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of a young boy, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And he cried out with a loud voice: I am clear from the blood of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Then all the people turning themselves towards him, said: What meaneth this word that thou hast spoken?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> But he standing in the midst of them, said: Are ye so foolish, ye <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, that without examination or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you have condemned a daughter of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Return to judgment, for they have borne <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> So all the people turned again in haste, and the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> said to him: Come, and sit thou down among us, and show it us: seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given thee the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of old age.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> said to the people: Separate these two far from one another, and I will examine them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> So when they were put asunder one from the other, he called one of them, and said to him: O thou that art grown old in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days, now are thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> come out, which thou hast committed before:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> In judging <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgments, oppressing the innocent, and letting the guilty to go free, whereas the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saith: The innocent and the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Now then if thou sawest her, tell me under what tree thou sawest them conversing together: He said: Under a mastic tree.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> said: Well hast thou <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lied</a> against thy own head: for behold the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a> having received the sentence of him, shall cut thee in two.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And having put him aside, he commanded that the other should come, and he said to him: O thou seed of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and not of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, beauty hath deceived tee, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> hath perverted thy heart:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> Thus did you do to the daughters of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and they for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> conversed with you: but a daughter of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> would not abide your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> Now, therefore, tell me, under what tree didst thou take them conversing together. And he answered: Under a holm tree.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> said to him: Well hast thou also <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lied</a> against thy own head: for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> waiteth with a sword to cut thee in two, and to destroy you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and they <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saveth</a> them that trust in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And they rose up against the two elders, (for <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> had convicted them of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> by their own mouth) and they did to them as they had <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">maliciously</a> dealt against their neighbour,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> To fulfil the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>: and they <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a>, and innocent blood was saved in that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> But Helcias, and his wife, praised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for their daughter, Susanna, with Joakim, her husband, and all her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>, because there was no dishonesty found in her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> became great in the sight of the people from that day, and thence forward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers; and Cyrus, the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, received his kingdom.</span></p>
