<h1>Daniel Chapter 14</h1>
<div class="h1a">The history of Bel, and of the great serpent worshipped by the Babylonians.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> was the king's guest, and was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> above all his friends. <span class="stiki"><strong>The king's guest...</strong> It seems most probable, that the king here spoken of was Evilmerodach, the son and successor of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, and a great favourer of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> had an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> called Bel: and there was spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and sixty vessels of wine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The king also worshipped him, and went every day to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> him: but <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the king said to him: Why dost thou not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> Bel?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he answered, and said to him: Because I do not worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> made with hands, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> heaven and earth, and hath power over all flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the king said to him: Doth not Bel seem to thee to be a living god? Seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> smiled, and said: O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, neither hath he eaten at any time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the king being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, called for his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and said to them: If you tell me not who it is that eateth up these expenses, you shall die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But if you can show that Bel eateth these things, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> shall die, because he hath <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> against Bel. And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> said to the king: Be it done according to thy word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Bel were seventy, besides their wives, and little ones, and children. And the king went with <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Bel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Bel said: Behold, we go out: and do thou, O king, set on the meats, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast, and seal it with thy own ring:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when thou comest in the morning, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death, or else <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, that hath lied against us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they little regarded it, because they had made under the table a secret entrance, and they always came in by it, and consumed those things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So it came to pass after they were gone out, the king set the meats before Bel: and <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> commanded his servants, and they brought ashes, and he sifted them all over the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> before the king: and going forth, they shut the door, and having sealed it with the king's ring, they departed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> went in by night, according to their custom, with their wives, and their children: and they ate and drank up all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the king arose early in the morning, and <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the king said: Are the seals whole, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>? And he answered: They are whole, O king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried out with a loud voice: Great art thou, O Bel, and there is not any <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a> with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> laughed: and he held the king, that he should not go in: and he said: Behold the pavement, mark whose footsteps these are.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the king said: I see the footsteps of men, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children. And the king was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Then he took the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and their wives, and their children: and they showed him the private doors by which they came in, and consumed the things that were on the table.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The king, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a>, and delivered Bel into the power of <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>: who destroyed him and his <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And there was a great dragon in that place, and the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> worshipped him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the king said to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>: Behold, thou canst not say now, that this is not a living god: <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> him, therefore.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> said: I <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord, my God</a>: for he is the living God: but that is no living god.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But give me leave, O king, and I will kill this dragon without sword or club. And the king said, I give thee leave.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> took pitch, and fat, and hair, and boiled them together: and he made lumps, and put them into the dragon's mouth, and the dragon burst asunder. And he said: Behold him whom you worship.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> had heard this, they took great indignation: and being gathered together against the king, they said: The king is become a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>. He hath destroyed Bel, he hath killed the dragon, and he hath put the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they came to the king, and said: Deliver us <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, or else we will destroy thee and thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the king saw that they pressed upon him <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a>: and being constrained by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>: he delivered <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they cast him into the den of lions, and he was there six days. <span class="stiki"><strong>The den of lions...</strong> <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> was twice cast into the den of lions; one under Darius the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Mede</a>, because he had transgressed the king's edict, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> three times a day: and another time under Evilmerodach by a sedition of the people. This time he remained six days in the lions' den; the other time only one night.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given to them two carcasses every day, and two sheep: but then they were not given unto them, that they might devour <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Now there was in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> called <a href="../cathen/07097a.htm">Habacuc</a>, and he had boiled pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl: and was going into the field, to carry it to the reapers. <span class="stiki"><strong>Habacuc...</strong> The same, as some think, whose <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> is found among the lesser <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but others <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him to be different.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/07097a.htm">Habacuc</a>: Carry the dinner which thou hast into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, who is in the lions' den.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/07097a.htm">Habacuc</a> said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, I never saw <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, nor do I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the den.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> took him by the top of his head, and carried him by the hair of his head, and set him in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, over the den, in the force of his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/07097a.htm">Habacuc</a> cried, saying: O <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, thou servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, take the dinner that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sent thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> said, Thou hast remembered me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thou hast not forsaken them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> arose, and ate. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> presently set <a href="../cathen/07097a.htm">Habacuc</a> again in his own place.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And upon the seventh day the king came to bewail <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>: and he came to the den, and looked in, and behold <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> was sitting in the midst of the lions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And the king cried out with a loud voice, saying: Great art thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Daniel. And he drew him out of the lions' den.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But those that had been the cause of his destruction, he cast into the den, and they were devoured in a moment before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Then the king said: Let all the inhabitants of the whole earth fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>: for he is the Saviour, working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>, and wonders in the earth: who hath delivered <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> out of the lions' den.</span></p>
