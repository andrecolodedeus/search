<h1>Daniel Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Daniel, by divine revelation, declares the dream of Nebuchadnezzer, and the interpretation of it. He is highly honoured by the king.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the second year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> had a dream, and his <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> was <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">terrified</a>, and his dream went out of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The second year...</strong> Viz., from the death of his father Nabopolassar; for he had reigned before as partner with his father in the empire.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then the king commanded to call together the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">wise men</a>, and the magicians, and the Chaldeans: to declare to the king his dreams: so they came and stood before the king. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Chaldeans...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologers</a>, that pretended to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divine</a> by stars.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king said to them: I saw a dream: and being troubled in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what I saw.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the Chaldeans answered the king in <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a>: O king, live for ever: tell to thy servants thy dream, and we will declare the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the king, answering, said to the Chaldeans: The thing is gone out of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: unless you tell me the dream, and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">meaning</a> thereof, you shall be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and your houses shall be confiscated.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But if you tell the dream, and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">meaning</a> of it, you shall receive of me rewards, and gifts, and great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: therefore, tell me the dream, and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They answered again and said: Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The king answered and said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, that you seek to gain <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, since you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the thing is gone from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If, therefore, you tell me not the dream, there is one sentence concerning you, that you have also framed a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a>, and full of <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>, to speak before me till the time pass away. Tell me, therefore, the dream, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you also give a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: There is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king; neither doth any king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviner</a>, or wise man, or Chaldean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For the thing that thou asketh, O king, is difficult: nor can any one be found that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Upon hearing this, the king in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a>, and in great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, commanded that all the wise men of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the decree being gone forth, the wise men were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a>: and <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> and his companions were sought for, to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> inquired concerning the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the sentence, of Arioch, the general of the king's army, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king. And when Arioch had told the matter to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> went in, and desired of the king, that he would give him time to resolve the question, and declare it to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he went into his house, and told the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias, his companions:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, concerning this secret, and that <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then was the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> by a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> in the night: and <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And speaking, he said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and for evermore: for wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are his.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he changeth times and ages: taketh away kingdoms, and establisheth them: giveth wisdom to the wise, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to them that have understanding:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealeth</a> deep and hidden things, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> what is in darkness: and light is with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> To thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee: because thou hast given me wisdom and strength: and now thou hast shown me what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us the king's discourse.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> After this <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Then Arioch in haste brought in <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> to the king, and said to him: I have found a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the children of the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, that will resolve the question to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> The king answered, and said to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> made answer before the king, and said: The secret that the king desireth to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, none of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">wise men</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, or the soothsayers, can declare to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But there is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> that <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealeth</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, who hath shown to thee, O <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealeth</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> showed thee what shall come to pass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> To me also this secret is <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a>, not by any wisdom that I have more than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> alive: but that the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the thoughts of thy <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was terrible.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer's threshing floor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: but the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> This is the dream: we will also tell the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof before thee, O king.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Thou art a king of kings: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> hath given thee a kingdom, and strength, and power, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And all places wherein the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the beasts of the field do dwell: he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand, and hath put all things under thy power: thou, therefore, art the head of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And after thee shall rise up another kingdom, inferior to thee, of silver: and another third kingdom of brass, which shall rule over all the world. <span class="stiki"><strong>Another kingdom...</strong> Viz., that of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. Ibid. <strong>Third kingdom...</strong> Viz., that of Alexander the Great.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron. As iron breaketh into pieces, and subdueth all things, so shall that break, and destroy all these. <span class="stiki"><strong>The fourth kingdom, etc...</strong> Some understand this of the successors of Alexander, the kings of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, others of the Roman empire, and its civil wars.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And whereas thou sawest the feet, and the toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron: the kingdom shall be divided, but yet it shall take its origin from the iron, according as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay: the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall be mingled indeed together with the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but they shall not stick fast one to another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> But in the days of those kingdoms, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people: and it shall break in pieces, and shall consume all these kingdoms: and itself shall stand for ever. <span class="stiki"><strong>A kingdom...</strong> Viz., the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which cannot be destroyed.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> According as thou sawest, that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and broke in pieces the clay and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">great God</a> hath shown the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof is faithful.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Then <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a> fell on his face, and worshipped <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, and commanded that they should offer in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to him victims and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And the king spoke to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, and said: Verily, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealer</a> of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">hidden things</a>: seeing thou couldst discover this secret.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Then the king advanced <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> to a high station, and gave him many and great gifts: and he made him governor over all the provinces of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>: and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> requested of the king, and he appointed Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, over the works of the province of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>: but <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> himself was in the king's palace.</span></p>
