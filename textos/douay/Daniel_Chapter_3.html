<div class="h1a">Nebuchadnezzer set up a golden statue; which he commands all to adore: the three children for refusing to do it are cast into the fiery furnace; but are not hurt by the flames. Their prayer and canticle of praise.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">King Nabuchodonosor</a> made a statue of gold, of sixty cubits high, and six cubits broad, and he set it up in the plain of Dura, of the province of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor, the king</a>, sent to call together the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, the rulers, and governors, and all the chief men of the provinces, to come to the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of the statue which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a> had set up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, and rulers, and the great men that were placed in authority, and all the princes of the provinces, were gathered together to come to the dedication of the statue, which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a> had set up. And they stood before the statue which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a> had set up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then a herald cried with a strong voice: To you it is commanded, O nations, tribes and languages:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and of the flute, and of the harp, of the sackbut, and of the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psaltery</a>, and of the symphony, and of all kind of music, ye fall down and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the golden statue which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a> hath set up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall not fall down and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>, he shall the same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Upon this, therefore, at the time when all the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psaltery</a>, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, all the nations, tribes, and languages fell down and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the golden statue which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a> had set up.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And said to <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>: O king, live for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall hear the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psaltery</a>, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, shall prostrate himself, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the golden statue:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And that if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall not fall down and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>, he should be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now there are certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whom thou hast set over the works of the province of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago: these men, O king, have slighted thy decree: they worship not thy gods, nor do they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the golden statue which thou hast set up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should be brought: who immediately were brought before the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor, the king</a>, spoke to them, and said: Is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the golden statue that I have set up?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now, therefore, if you be ready, at what hour soever, you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psaltery</a>, and symphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the statue which I have made: but if you do not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that shall deliver you out of my hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, answered, and said to <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>: We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For behold our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom we worship, is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire, and to deliver us out of thy hands, O king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But if he will not, be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to thee, O king, that we will not worship thy gods, nor <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the golden statue which thou hast set up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then was <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> filled with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a>: and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had been accustomed to be heated.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And immediately these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were bound, and were cast into the furnace of burning fire, with their coats, and their caps, and their shoes, and their garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace was heated exceedingly. And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they walked in the midst of the flame, praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.
 <span class="stiki"><strong>And they walked, etc...</strong> Here <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> takes notice, that from this verse, to <a href="../douay/dan003.htm#verse91">verse 91</a>, was not in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> in his time. But as it was in all the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Greek Bibles</a>, (which were originally translated from the <a href="../cathen/07175a.htm">Hebrew</a>), it is more than probable that it had been formerly in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> or rather in the Chaldaic, in which the book of Daniel was written. But this is certain: that it is, and has been of old, received by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, and read as <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">canonical scripture</a> in her <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, and divine offices.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Then Azarias standing up, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in this manner, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said:</span></p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Wherefore, all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment:</span><br />

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Now the king's servants that had cast them in, ceased not to heat the furnace with brimstone and tow, and pitch, and dry sticks,</span>
