<h1>Daniel Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">Nebuchadnezzer's dream, by which the judgments of God are denounced against him for his pride, is interpreted by Daniel, and verified by the event.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I saw a dream that affrighted me: and my thoughts in my bed, and the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of my head, troubled me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then I set forth a decree, that all the wise men of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> should be brought in before me, and that they should show me the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation of the dream</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then came in the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">wise men</a>, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers, and I told the dream before them: but they did not show me the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Till their colleague, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, came in before me, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is Baltassar, according to the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of my god, who hath in him the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gods: and I told the dream before him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Baltassar, according to the name of my god...</strong> He says this, because the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of Baltassar, or Belteshazzar, is derived from the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of Bel, the chief god of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Baltassar, prince of the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou hast in thee the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gods, and that no secret is impossible to thee, tell me the visions of my dreams that I have seen, and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> This was the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of my head in my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was exceeding great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The tree was great and strong, and the height thereof reached unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: the sight thereof was even to the ends of all the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Its leaves were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much: and in it was food for all: under it dwelt cattle and beasts, and in the branches thereof the fowls of the air had their abode: and all flesh did eat of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> I saw in the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of my head upon my bed, and behold a watcher, and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>A watcher...</strong> A vigilant <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, perhaps the <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He cried aloud, and said thus: Cut down the tree, and chop off the branches thereof: shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruits: let the beasts fly away that are under it, and the birds from its branches.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Nevertheless, leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be tied with a band of iron and of brass, among the grass, that is without, and let it be wet with the dew of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and let its portion be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Let his heart be changed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a>, and let a beast's heart be given him: and let seven times pass over him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let his heart be changed, etc...</strong> It does not appear by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> that <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> was changed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shape; much less that he was changed into an ox; but only that he lost his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and became <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">mad</a>; and in this condition remained abroad in the company of beasts, eating grass like an ox, till his hair grew in such manner as to resemble the feathers of eagles, and his nails to be like birds' claws.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> This is the decree by the sentence of the watchers, and the word and demand of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones: till the living <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a> ruleth in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and he will give it to whomsoever it shall please him, and he will appoint the basest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> over it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>, saw this dream: thou, therefore, O Baltassar, tell me quickly the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a>: for all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to declare the meaning of it to me: but thou art able, because the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gods is in thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Baltassar, began silently to think within himself for about one hour: and his thoughts troubled him. But the king answering, said: Baltassar, let not the dream and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof trouble thee. Baltassar answered, and said: My lord, the dream be to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thee, and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof to thy enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The tree which thou sawest, which was high and strong, whose height reached to the skies, and the sight thereof into all the earth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the branches thereof were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much, and in it was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and the birds of the air had their abode in its branches.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> It is thou, O king, who art grown great, and become mighty: for thy greatness hath grown, and hath reached to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and thy power unto the ends of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And whereas the king saw a watcher, and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and say: Cut down the tree, and destroy it, but leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, and let it be bound with iron and brass, among the grass without, and let it be sprinkled with the dew of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and let his feeding be with the wild beasts, till seven times pass over him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> This is the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> of the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>, which is come upon my lord, the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> They shall cast thee out from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle, and with wild beasts, and thou shalt eat grass, as an ox, and shalt be wet with the dew of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a> ruleth over the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But whereas he commanded, that the stump of the roots thereof, that is, of the tree, should be left: thy kingdom shall remain to thee, after thou shalt have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that power is from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> thou thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> with works of mercy to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>: perhaps he will forgive thy offences.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> All these things came upon <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> At the end of twelve months he was walking in the palace of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the king answered, and said: Is not this the great <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, which I have built, to be the seat of the kingdom, by the strength of my power, and in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of my excellence?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And while the word was yet in the king's mouth, a voice came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: To thee, O <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>, it is said: Thy kingdom shall pass from thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they shall cast thee out from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and wild beasts: thou shalt eat grass like an ox, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a> ruleth in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> The same hour the word was fulfilled upon <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, and he was driven away from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and did eat grass, like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: till his hairs grew like the feathers of eagles, and his nails like birds' claws.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Now at the end of the days, I, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, lifted up my eyes to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and my sense was restored to me: and I <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>, and I praised and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> him that liveth for ever: for his power is an everlasting power, and his kingdom is to all <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him: for he doth according to his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as well with the powers of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as among the inhabitants of the earth: and there is none that can resist his hand, and say to him: Why hast thou done it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> At the same time my sense returned to me, and I came to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of my kingdom: and my shape returned to me: and my nobles, and my magistrates, sought for me, and I was restored to my kingdom: and greater majesty was added to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Therefore I, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, do now praise, and magnify, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">King of heaven</a>: because all his works are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and his ways judgments, and them that walk in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> he is able to abase. <span class="stiki"><strong>I, Nabuchodonosor, do now, etc...</strong> From this place some <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> infer that this king became a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a>, and dying not long after, was probably <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>.</span></span></p>
