<h1>Daniel Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">Daniel is promoted by Darius: his enemies procure a law forbidding prayer; for the transgression of this law Daniel is cast into the lions' den: but miraculously delivered.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to Darius, and he appointed over the kingdom a hundred and twenty governors, to be over his whole kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And three princes over them of whom <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> was one: that the governors might give an account to them, and the king might have no trouble.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> excelled all the princes, and governors: because a greater <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a> was in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king thought to set him over all the kingdom; whereupon the princes, and the governors, sought to find occasion against <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, with regard to the king: and they could find no cause, nor suspicion, because he was faithful, and no fault, nor suspicion was found in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> said: We shall not find any occasion against this <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, unless perhaps concerning the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law</a> of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then the princes, and the governors, craftily suggested to the king, and spoke thus unto him: King Darius, live for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> All the princes of the kingdom, the magistrates, and governors, the senators, and judges, have consulted together, that an imperial decree, and an edict be published: That whosoever shall ask any petition of any god, or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for thirty days, but of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of the lions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now, therefore, O king, confirm the sentence, and sign the decree: that what is decreed by the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> may not be altered, nor any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be allowed to transgress it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So king Darius set forth the decree, and established it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now, when <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this, that is to say, that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was made, he went into his house: and opening the windows in his upper chamber towards <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt down</a> three times a day, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> and gave thanks before his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he had been accustomed to do before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Wherefore those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> carefully watching him, found <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and making supplication to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they came and spoke to the king concerning the edict: O king, hast thou not decreed, that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that should make a request to any of the gods, or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for thirty days, but to thyself, O king, should be cast into the den of the lions? And the king answered them, saying: The word is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, according to the decree of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, which it is not lawful to violate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then they answered, and said before the king: <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, who is of the children of the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, hath not regarded thy <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, nor the decree that thou hast made: but three times a day he maketh his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now when the king had heard these words, he was very much grieved, and in behalf of <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> he set his heart to deliver him, and even till sunset he laboured to save him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> perceiving the king's design, said to him: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> thou, O king, that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> is, that no decree which the king hath made, may be altered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then the king commanded, and they brought <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, and cast him into the den of the lions. And the king said to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>: Thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom thou always servest, he will deliver thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den: which the king sealed with his own ring, and with the ring of his nobles, that nothing should be done against <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the king went away to his house, and laid himself down without taking supper, and meat was not set before him, and even sleep departed from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then the king rising very early in the morning, went in haste to the lions' den:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And coming near to the den, cried with a lamentable voice to <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, and said to him: <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, servant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, hath thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom thou servest always, been able, thinkest thou, to deliver thee from the lions?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> answering the king, said: O king, live for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sent his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and hath shut up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> hath been found in me: yea, and before thee, O king, I have done no offence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and he commanded that <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> should be taken out of the den: and <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> was taken out of the den, and no hurt was found in him, because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And by the king's commandment, those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were brought that had accused <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>: and they were cast into the lions' den, they and their children, and their wives: and they did not reach the bottom of the den, before the lions caught them, and broke all their bones in pieces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Then king Darius wrote to all people, tribes, and languages, dwelling in the whole earth: PEACE be multiplied unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> It is decreed by me, that in all my empire and my kingdom, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> dread and fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>. For he is the living and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for ever: and his <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> shall not be destroyed, and his power shall be for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He is the deliverer, and saviour, doing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and in earth: who hath delivered <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> out of the lions' den.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Now <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> continued unto the reign of Darius, and the reign of Cyrus, the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>.</span></p>
