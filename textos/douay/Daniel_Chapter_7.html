<h1>Daniel Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">Daniel's vision of the four beasts, signifying four kingdoms: of God sitting on his throne: and of the opposite kingdoms of Christ and Antichrist.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the first year of <a href="../cathen/02226c.htm">Baltasar</a>, king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> saw a dream: and the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of his head was upon his bed: and writing the dream, he comprehended it in a few words: and relating the sum of it in short, he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I saw in my <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> by night, and behold the four winds of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> strove upon the great sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And four great beasts, different one from another, came up out of the sea. <span class="stiki"><strong>Four great beasts...</strong> Viz., the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldean</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Grecian</a>, and Roman empires. But some rather choose to understand the fourth beast of the successors of Alexander the Great, more especially of them that reigned in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The first was like a lioness, and had the wings of an eagle: I beheld till her wings were plucked off, and she was lifted up from the earth, and stood upon her feet as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the heart of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was given to her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And behold another beast, like a bear, stood up on one side: and there were three rows in the mouth thereof, and in the teeth thereof, and thus they said to it: Arise, devour much flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> After this I beheld, and lo, another like a leopard, and it had upon it four wings, as of a fowl, and the beast had four heads, and power was given to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> After this I beheld in the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">vision of the night</a>, and lo, a fourth beast, terrible and wonderful, and exceeding strong, it had great iron teeth, eating and breaking in pieces, and treading down the rest with his feet: and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen before it, and had ten horns. <span class="stiki"><strong>Ten horns...</strong> That is, ten kingdoms, (as <a href="../douay/rev017.htm#verse12">Apocalypse 17:12</a>), among which the empire of the fourth beast shall be parcelled. Or ten kings of the number of the successors of Alexander; as <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figures</a> of such as shall be about the time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> I considered the horns, and behold another little horn sprung out of the midst of them: and three of the first horns were plucked up at the presence thereof: and behold eyes like the eyes of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things. <span class="stiki"><strong>Another little horn...</strong> This is commonly understood of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. It may also be applied to that great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutor</a> Antiochus Epiphanes, as a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> I beheld till thrones were placed, and the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">ancient of days</a> sat: his garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like clean wool: his throne like flames of fire: the wheels of it like a burning fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> A swift stream of fire issued forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before him: the judgment sat, and the books were opened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I beheld, because of the voice of the great words which that horn spoke: and I saw that the beast was slain, and the body thereof was destroyed, and given to the fire to be burnt:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And that the power of the other beasts was taken away: and that times of life were appointed them for a time, and a time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I beheld, therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">vision of the night</a>, and lo, one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came with the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and he came even to the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">ancient of days</a>: and they presented him before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he gave him power, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>: and all peoples, tribes, and tongues shall serve him: his power is an everlasting power that shall not be taken away: and his <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> that shall not be destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> My spirit trembled; I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, was affrighted at these things, and the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of my head troubled me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I went near to one of them that stood by, and asked the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of him concerning all these things, and he told me the interpretation of the words, and instructed me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> These four great beasts, are four kingdoms, which shall arise out of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most high God</a> shall take the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>: and they shall possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> for ever and ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> After this I would diligently learn concerning the fourth beast, which was very different from all, and exceeding terrible: his teeth and claws were of iron: he devoured and broke in pieces, and the rest he stamped upon with his feet:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And concerning the ten horns that he had on his head: and concerning the other that came up, before which three horns fell: and of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and was greater than the rest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I beheld, and lo, that horn made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and prevailed over them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Till the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">ancient of days</a> came and gave judgment to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>, and the time came, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> obtained the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And thus he said: The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be greater than all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the ten horns of the same kingdom, shall be ten kings: and another shall rise up after them, and he shall be mightier than the former, and he shall bring down three kings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he shall speak words against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">High One</a>, and shall crush the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>: and he shall think himself able to change times and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time, and times, and half a time. <span class="stiki"><strong>A time, and times, and half a time...</strong> That is, three years and a half; which is supposed to be the length of the duration of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And a judgment shall sit, that his power may be taken away, and be broken in pieces, and perish even to the end.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>, and power, and the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>, under the whole <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, may be given to the people of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>: whose <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> is an everlasting <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>, and all kings shall serve him, and shall <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Hitherto is the end of the word. I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, was much troubled with my thoughts, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the word in my heart.</span></p>
