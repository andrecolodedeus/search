<h1>Daniel Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="h1a">Daniel's vision of the ram and the he goat interpreted by the angel Gabriel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the third year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/02226c.htm">king Baltasar</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> appeared to me. I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, after what I had seen in the beginning,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Saw in my <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> when I was in the castle of <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susa</a>, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> that I was over the gate of Ulai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up.  <span class="stiki"><strong>A ram...</strong> The empire of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Afterward I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and became great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I understood: and behold a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he touched not the ground, and the he goat had a notable horn between his eyes. <span class="stiki"><strong>A he goat...</strong> The empire of the <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greeks</a>, or Macedonians. Ibid. <strong>He touched not the ground...</strong> He conquered all before him, with so much rapidity, that he seemed rather to fly, than to walk upon the earth. -- Ibid. <strong>A notable horn...</strong> Alexander the Great.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when he was come near the ram, he was enraged against him, and struck the ram: and broke his two horns, and the ram could not withstand him: and when he had cast him down on the ground, he stamped upon him, and none could deliver the ram out of his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the he goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Four horns...</strong> Seleucus, Antigonus, Philip, and Ptolemeus, the successors of Alexander, who divided his empire among them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And out of one of them came forth a little horn: and it became great against the south, and against the east, and against the strength. <span class="stiki"><strong>A little horn...</strong> Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of Seleucus. He grew against the south, and the east, by his victories over the kings of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>: and against the strength, that is, against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And it was magnified even unto the strength of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and it threw down of the strength, and of the stars, and trod upon them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Unto the strength of heaven...</strong> or, against the strength of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. So are here called the army of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength: and it took away from him the continual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and cast down the place of his sanctuary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And strength was given him against the continual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall be cast down on the ground, and he shall do and shall prosper.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I heard one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> speaking, and one <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> said to another I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not to whom, that was speaking: How long shall be the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, concerning the continual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed. <span class="stiki"><strong>Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days...</strong> That is, six years and almost four months: which was the whole time from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Antiochus till his death.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it came to pass when I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, saw the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And I heard the voice of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> between Ulai: and he called, and said: <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Gabriel</a>, make this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to understand the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he came, and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face, trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, for in the time of the end the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> shall be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when he spoke to me, I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he said to me: I will show thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">malediction</a>: for the time hath its end.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the he goat, is the king of the <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greeks</a>, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it, four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And after their reign, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> According to his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">puffed up</a>, and in the abundance of all things he shall <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of the evening and the morning, which was told, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: thou, therefore, seal up the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, because it shall come to pass after many days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king's business, and I was astonished at the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, and there was none that could interpret it.</span></p>
