<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the first year of Darius, the son of <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">Assuerus</a>, of the seed of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>, who reigned over the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldeans</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The first year of his reign I, <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, understood by books the number of the years, concerning which the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah, the prophet</a>, that seventy years should be accomplished of the desolation of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I set my face to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and make supplication with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, and ashes.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> We have not hearkened to thy servants, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that have spoken in thy name to our kings, to our princes, to our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our princes, and to our fathers, that have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But to thee, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, mercy and forgiveness, for we have departed from thee:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he hath confirmed his words which he spoke against us, and against our princes that judged us, that he would bring in upon us a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, such as never was under all the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, according to that which hath been done in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> As it is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, all this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is come upon us: and we entreated not thy face, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, that we might turn from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, and think on thy <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath watched upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and hath brought it upon us: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> in all his works which he hath done: for we have not hearkened to his voice.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, against all thy <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: let thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and thy indignation be turned away, I beseech thee, from thy city, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and from thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now, therefore, O our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hear the supplication of thy servant, and his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: and show thy face upon thy sanctuary, which is desolate, for thy own sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Incline, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thy ear, and hear: open thy eyes, and see our desolation, and the city upon which thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is called: for it is not for our justifications that we present our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before thy face, but for the multitude of thy tender mercies.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he instructed me, and spoke to me, and said: O <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, I am now come forth to teach thee, and that thou mightest understand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> From the beginning of thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the word came forth: and I am come to show it to thee, because thou art a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of desires: therefore, do thou mark the word, and understand the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Man of desires...</strong> that is, ardently <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> then in <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Seventy weeks are shortened upon thy people, and upon thy <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>, that transgression may be finished, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may have an end, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> may be abolished; and everlasting <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> may be brought; and <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> may be fulfilled; and the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Saint of saints</a> may be anointed. <span class="stiki"><strong>Seventy weeks...</strong> Viz., of years, (or seventy times seven, that is, 490 years), are shortened; that is, fixed and determined, so that the time shall be no longer.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> thou, therefore, and take notice: that from the going forth of the word, to build up <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> again, unto <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the prince, there shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks: and the street shall be built again, and the walls, in straitness of times. <span class="stiki"><strong>From the going forth of the word, etc...</strong> That is, from the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes, when by his commandment <a href="../cathen/10737c.htm">Nehemiah</a> rebuilt the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../douay/neh002.htm">Nehemiah 2</a>. From which time, according to the best <a href="../cathen/03731a.htm">chronology</a>, there were just sixty-nine weeks of years, that is, 483 years to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when he first began to preach and execute the office of <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. -- Ibid. <strong>In straitness of times...</strong> <em>angustia temporum</em>: which may allude both to the difficulties and opposition they met with in building: and to the shortness of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in which they finished the wall, viz., fifty-two days.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And after sixty-two weeks <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> shall be slain: and the people that shall deny him shall not be his.

Others of the bringing in thither the ensigns and standard of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Romans. Others, in fine, distinguish three different times of desolation: viz., that under Antiochus; that when the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was destroyed by the Romans; and the last near the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a> under <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. To all which, as they suppose, this <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> may have a relation.</span></span></p>
