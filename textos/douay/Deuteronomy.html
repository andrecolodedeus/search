<h1>Deuteronomy</h1>

<p>This book is called <em>Deuteronomy</em>, which signifies a <em>Second Law</em>, because it repeats and inculcates the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">ordinances</a> formerly given on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, with other <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> not expressed before. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, from the first words in the book, call it <em>Elle Haddebarim</em>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">PENTATEUCH</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/deu001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> A repetition of what passed at Sinai and Cadesbarne: and of the people's murmuring and their punishment.
<br><a href="../douay/deu002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> They are forbid to fight against the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites. Their victory over Sehon king of Hesebon.
<br><a href="../douay/deu003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> The victory over Og king of Basan. Ruben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses receive their possession on the other side of Jordan.
<br><a href="../douay/deu004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Moses exhorteth the people to keep God's commandments: particularly to fly idolatry. Appointeth three cities of refuge, on that side of the Jordan.
<br><a href="../douay/deu005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> The ten commandments are repeated and explained.
<br><a href="../douay/deu006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> An exhortation to the love of God, and obedience to his law.
<br><a href="../douay/deu007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> No league nor fellowship to be made with the Chanaanites: God promiseth his people his blessing and assistance, if they keep his commandments.
<br><a href="../douay/deu008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> The people is put in mind of God's dealings with them, to the end that they may love him and serve him.
<br><a href="../douay/deu009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> Lest they should impute their victories to their own merits, they are put in mind of their manifold rebellions and other sins, for which they should have been destroyed, but God spared them for his promise made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<br><a href="../douay/deu010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> God giveth the second tables of the law: a further exhortation to fear and serve the Lord.
<br><a href="../douay/deu011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> The love and service of God are still inculcated, with a blessing to them that serve him, and threats of punishment if they forsake his law.
<br><a href="../douay/deu012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> All idolatry must be extirpated: sacrifices, tithes, and firstfruits must be offered in one only place: all eating of blood is prohibited.
<br><a href="../douay/deu013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> False prophets must be slain, and idolatrous cities destroyed.
<br><a href="../douay/deu014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> In mourning for the dead they are not to follow the ways of the Gentiles: the distinction of clean and unclean meats: ordinances concerning tithes, and firstfruits.
<br><a href="../douay/deu015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> The law of the seventh year of remission. The firstlings of cattle are to be sanctified to the Lord.
<br><a href="../douay/deu016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> The three principal solemnities to be observed: just judges to be appointed in every city: all occasions of idolatry to be avoided.
<br><a href="../douay/deu017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> Victims must be without blemish. Idolaters are to be slain. Controversies are to be decided by the high priest and council, whose sentence must be obeyed under pain of death. The duty of a king, who is to receive the law of God at the priest's hands.
<br><a href="../douay/deu018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> The Lord is the inheritance of the priests and Levites. Heathenish abominations are to be avoided. The great PROPHET CHRIST is promised. False prophets must be slain.
<br><a href="../douay/deu019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> The cities of refuge. Wilful murder, and false witnesses must be punished.
<br><a href="../douay/deu020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> Laws relating to war.
<br><a href="../douay/deu021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> The expiation of a secret murder. The marrying a captive. The eldest son must not be deprived of his birthright for hatred of his mother. A stubborn son is to be stoned to death. When one is hanged on a gibbet, he must be taken down the same day and buried.
<br><a href="../douay/deu022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> Humanity towards neighbours. Neither sex may use the apparel of the other. Cruelty to be avoided even to birds. Battlements about the roof of a house. Things of divers kinds not to be mixed. The punishment of him that slandereth his wife, as also of adultery and rape.
<br><a href="../douay/deu023.htm"><strong>Chapter 23.</strong></a> Who may and who may not enter into the church: uncleanness to be avoided: other precepts concerning fugitives, fornication, usury, vows, and eating other men's grapes and corn.
<br><a href="../douay/deu024.htm"><strong>Chapter 24.</strong></a> Divorce permitted to avoid greater evil: the newly married must not go to war: of men stealers, of leprosy, of pledges, of labourers' hire, of justice, and of charity to the poor.
<br><a href="../douay/deu025.htm"><strong>Chapter 25.</strong></a> Stripes must not exceed forty. The ox is not to be muzzled. Of raising seed to the brother. Of the immodest woman. Of unjust weight. Of destroying the Amalecites.
<br><a href="../douay/deu026.htm"><strong>Chapter 26.</strong></a> The form of words with which the firstfruits and tithes are to be offered. God's covenant.
<br><a href="../douay/deu027.htm"><strong>Chapter 27.</strong></a> The commandments must be written on stones: and an altar erected, and sacrifices offered. The observers of the commandments are to be blessed, and the transgressors cursed.
<br><a href="../douay/deu028.htm"><strong>Chapter 28.</strong></a> Many blessings are promised to observers of God's commandments: and curses threatened to transgressors.
<br><a href="../douay/deu029.htm"><strong>Chapter 29.</strong></a> The covenant is solemnly confirmed between God and his people. Threats against those that shall break it.
<br><a href="../douay/deu030.htm"><strong>Chapter 30.</strong></a> Great mercies are promised to the penitent: God's commandment is feasible. Life and death are set before them.
<br><a href="../douay/deu031.htm"><strong>Chapter 31.</strong></a> Moses encourageth the people, and Josue, who is appointed to succeed him. He delivereth the law to the priests. God foretelleth that the people will often forsake him, and that he will punish them. He commandeth Moses to write a canticle, as a constant remembrancer of the law.
<br><a href="../douay/deu032.htm"><strong>Chapter 32.</strong></a> A canticle for the remembrance of the law. Moses is commanded to go up into a mountain, from whence he shall see the promised land but not enter into it.
<br><a href="../douay/deu033.htm"><strong>Chapter 33.</strong></a> Moses before his death blesseth the tribes of Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/deu034.htm"><strong>Chapter 34.</strong></a> Moses seeth the promised land, but is not suffered to go into it. He dieth at the age of 120 years. God burieth his body secretly, and all Israel mourn for him thirty days. Josue, replenished (by imposition of Moses' hands) with the spirit of God, succeedeth. But Moses, for his special familiarity with God, and for most wonderful miracles, is commended above all other prophets.
