<div class="h1a">A repetition of what passed at Sinai and Cadesbarne: and of the people's murmuring and their punishment.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> These are the words, which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, in the plain <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, over against the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, between Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth, where there is very much gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Eleven days' journey from <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a> by the way of mount Seir to <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cadesbarne</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, the first day of the month, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> all that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him to say to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> After that he had slain Sehon king of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>: and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth, and in Edrai,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> began to expound the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, and to say:</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> spoke to us in <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a>, saying: You have stayed long enough in this mountain:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Turn you, and come to the mountain of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, and to the other places that are next to it, the plains and the hills and the vales towards the south, and by the sea shore, the land of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, and of Libanus, as far as the great river Euphrates.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Behold, said he, I have delivered it to you: go in and possess it, concerning which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to your fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, that he would give it to them, and to their seed after them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I said to you at that time:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> I alone am not able to bear you: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> hath multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, for multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> (The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of your fathers add to this number many thousands, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> you as he hath spoken.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I alone am not able to bear your business, and the charge of you and your differences.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Let me have from among you wise and understanding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and such whose conversation is approved among your <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>, that I may appoint them your rulers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then you answered me: The thing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which thou meanest to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I took out of your <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> wise and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, and appointed them rulers, tribunes, and <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurions</a>, and officers over fifties, and over tens, who might teach you all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And I commanded them, saying: Hear them, and judge that which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: whether he be one of your country, or a stranger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> There shall be no difference of persons, you shall hear the little as well as the great: neither shall you respect any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> person, because it is the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And if any thing seem hard to you, refer it to me, and I will hear it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I commanded you all things that you were to do.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And departing from <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a>, we passed through the terrible and vast <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, which you saw, by the way of the mountain of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> had commanded us. And when we were come into <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cadesbarne</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> I said to you: You are come to the mountain of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> will give to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> See the land which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> giveth thee: go up and possess it, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> hath spoken to thy fathers: fear not, nor be any way discouraged.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And you came all to me, and said: Let us send <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who may view the land, and bring us word what way we shall go up, and to what cities we shall go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelve <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, one of every <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Who, when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains, came as far as the valley of the cluster: and having viewed the land,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Taking of the fruits thereof, to show its fertility, they brought them to us, and said: The land is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> will give us.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And you would not go up, but being incredulous to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> You murmured in your tents, and said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateth</a> us, and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that he might deliver us into the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and destroy us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Whither shall we go up? the messengers have terrified our hearts, saying: The multitude is very great, and taller than we: the cities are great, and walled up to the sky, we have seen the sons of the Enacims there. <span class="stiki"><strong>Walled up to the sky...</strong> A figurative expression, signifying the walls to be very high.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And I said to you: Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, who is your leader, himself will fight for you, as he did in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in the sight of all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> (as thou hast seen) the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath carried thee, as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is wont to carry his little son, all the way that you have come, until you came to this place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And yet for all this you did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Who went before you in the way, and marked out the place, wherein you should pitch your tents, in the night showing you the way by fire, and in the day by the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of a cloud</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had heard the voice of your words, he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a>, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Not one of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> shall see the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> land, which I <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to your fathers:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Except <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb the son of Jephone</a>: for he shall see it, and to him I will give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath followed the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Neither is his indignation against the people to be wondered at, since the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me also on your account, and said: Neither shalt thou go in thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>, thy minister, he shall go in for thee: exhort and encourage him, and he shall divide the land by lot to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Your children, of whom you said that they should be led away captives, and your sons who know not this day the difference of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they shall go in: and to them I will give the land, and they shall possess it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But return you and go into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> by the way of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And you answered me: We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: we will go up and fight, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> hath commanded. And when you went ready armed unto the mountain,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Say to them: Go not up, and fight not, for I am not with you: lest you fall before your enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> I spoke, and you hearkened not: but resisting the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and swelling with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, you went up into the mountain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a> that dwelt in the mountains coming out, and meeting you, chased you, as bees do: and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as Horma.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And when you returned and wept before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he heard you not, neither would he yield to your voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> So you abode in <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cadesbarne</a> a long time.</span></p>
