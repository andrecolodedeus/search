<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thou shalt forthwith kill the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, and shalt destroy it and all things that are in it, even the cattle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And all the household goods that are there, thou shalt gather together in the midst of the streets thereof, and shall burn them with the city itself, so as to consume all for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and that it be a heap for ever: it shall be built no more.</span>
