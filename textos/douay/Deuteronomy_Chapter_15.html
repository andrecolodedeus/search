<div class="h1a">The law of the seventh year of remission. The firstlings of cattle are to be sanctified to the Lord.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the <a href="../cathen/13289a.htm">seventh year</a> thou shalt make a remission,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Which shall be celebrated in this order. He to whom any thing is <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">owing</a> from his friend or neighbour or brother, cannot demand it again, because it is the <a href="../cathen/08531c.htm">year of remission</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Of the foreigner or stranger thou mayst exact it: of thy countryman and neighbour thou shalt not have power to demand it again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And there shall be no <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> nor beggar among you: that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee in the land which he will give thee in possession. <span class="stiki"><strong>There shall be no poor, etc...</strong> It is not to be understood as a <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, that there should be no <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as appears from verse 11, where we learn that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> people would never be at a loss to find objects for their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>: but it is an ordinance that all should do their best endeavours to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the hardships of <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty and want</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Yet so if thou hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and keep all things that he hath ordained, and which I command thee this day, he will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, as he hath <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thou shalt lend to many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and thou shalt borrow of no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Thou shalt have dominion over very many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and no one shall have dominion over thee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> If one of thy brethren that dwelleth within thy gates of thy city in the land which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will give thee, come to <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty</a>: thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor close thy hand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But shalt open it to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, thou shalt lend him, that which thou perceivest he hath need of.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Beware lest perhaps a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thought steal in upon thee, and thou say in thy heart: The <a href="../cathen/13289a.htm">seventh year of remission</a> draweth nigh; and thou turn away thy eyes from thy <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> brother, denying to lend him that which he asketh: lest he cry against thee to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and it become a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But thou shalt give to him: neither shalt thou do any thing craftily in relieving his necessities: that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee at all times, and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> There will not be wanting <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> in the land of thy habitation: therefore I command thee to open thy hand to thy <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy and poor</a> brother, that liveth in the land.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> When thy brother a <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrew</a> man, or <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">sold</a> to thee, and hath served thee six years, in the <a href="../cathen/13289a.htm">seventh year</a> thou shalt let him go free:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when thou sendest him out free, thou shalt not let him go away empty:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But shall give him for his way out of thy flocks, and out of thy barnfloor, and thy winepress, wherewith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Remember that thou also wast a bondservant in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> made thee free, and therefore I now command thee this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But if he say: I will not depart: because he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> thee, and thy house, and findeth that he is well with thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Thou shalt take an awl, and bore through his ear in the door of thy house, and he shall serve thee for ever: thou shalt do in like manner to thy womanservant also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them free: because he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a hireling: that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee in all the works that thou dost.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstlings</a>, that come of thy herds and thy sheep, thou shalt sanctify to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> whatsoever is of the male sex. Thou shalt not work with the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstling</a> of a bullock, and thou shalt not shear the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstlings</a> of thy sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> In the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shalt thou eat them every year, in the place that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall choose, thou and thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But if it have a blemish, or be lame, or blind, or in any part disfigured or feeble, it shall not be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But thou shalt eat it within the gates of thy city: the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> shall eat them alike, as the roe and as the hart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Only thou shalt take heed not to eat their blood, but pour it out on the earth as water.</span></p>
