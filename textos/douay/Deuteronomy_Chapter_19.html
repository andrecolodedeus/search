<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> When the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath destroyed the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, whose land he will deliver to thee, and thou shalt possess it, and shalt dwell in the cities and houses thereof:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thou shalt separate to thee <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">three cities</a> in the midst of the land, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will give thee in possession,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Paving diligently the way: and thou shalt divide the whole province of thy land equally into three parts: that he who is forced to flee for manslaughter, may have near at hand whither to escape.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> This shall be the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> of the slayer that fleeth, whose life is to be saved: He that <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killeth</a> his neighbor <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a>, and who is proved to have had no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against him yesterday and the day before:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But to have gone with him to the wood to hew wood, and in cutting down the tree the axe slipped out of his hand, and the iron slipping from the handle struck his friend, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> him: he shall flee to one of the <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">cities</a> aforesaid, and live:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Lest perhaps the next <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsman</a> of him whose blood was shed, pushed on by his grief should pursue, and apprehend him, if the way be too long, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">take away the life</a> of him who is not guilty of death, because he is proved to have had no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> before against him that was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Therefore I command thee, that thou separate <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">three cities</a> at equal distance one from another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall have enlarged thy borders, as he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to the fathers, and shall give thee all the land that he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> (Yet so, if thou keep his <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, and do the things which I command thee this day, that thou <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and walk in his ways at all times) thou shalt add to thee other <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">three cities</a>, and shalt double the number of the <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">three cities</a> aforesaid:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> That innocent blood may not be shed in the midst of the land which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will give thee to possess, lest thou be guilty of blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hating</a> his neighbour, lie in wait for his life, and rise and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">strike</a> him, and he die, and he flee to one of the <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">cities</a> aforesaid,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The ancients of his city shall send, and take him out of the <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">place of refuge</a>, and shall deliver him into the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsman</a> of him whose blood was shed, and he shall <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">die</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thou shalt not pity him, and thou shalt take away the guilt of innocent blood out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that it may be well with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Thou shalt not take nor remove thy neighbour's landmark, which thy predecessors have set in thy possession, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will give thee in the land that thou shalt receive to possess.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> One witness shall not rise up against any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> be: but in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> If a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> witness stand against a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, accusing him of transgression,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Both of them, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the judges that shall be in those days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when after most diligent inquisition, they shall find that the false witness hath told a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> against his brother:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother, and thou shalt take away the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> out of the midst of thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> That others hearing may fear, and may not dare to do such things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</span></p>
