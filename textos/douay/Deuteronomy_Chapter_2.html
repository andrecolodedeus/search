<div class="h1a">They are forbid to fight against the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites. Their victory over Sehon king of Hesebon.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And departing from thence we came into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> that leadeth to the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had spoken to me: and we compassed mount Seir a long time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> You have compassed this mountain long enough: go toward the north:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And command thou the people, saying: You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">children of Esau</a>, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them. For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread upon, because I have given mount Seir to <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Esau</a>, for a possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat: you shall draw waters for money, and shall drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> thee in every work of thy hands: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> dwelling with thee, knoweth thy journey, how thou hast passed through this great <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, for forty years, and thou hast wanted nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when we had passed by our brethren the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">children of Esau</a>, that dwelt in Seir, by the way of the plain from Elath and from <a href="../cathen/01792a.htm">Asiongaber</a>, we came to the way that leadeth to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Fight not against the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>, neither go to battle against them: for I will not give thee any of their land, because I have given Ar to the children of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> in possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof, a people great, and strong, and so tall, that like the race of the Enacims,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> They were esteemed as giants, and were like the sons of the Enacims. But the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> call them Emims.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir: who being driven out and destroyed, the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">children of Esau</a> dwelt there, as <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did in the land of his possession, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared, we came to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the time that we journeyed from <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cadesbarne</a> till we passed over the torrent Zared, was thirty-eight years: until all the <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were fit for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was consumed out of the camp, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had sworn:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For his hand was against them, that they should perish from the midst of the camp.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And after all the fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were dead,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Thou shalt pass this day the borders of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, the city <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Ar:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, take heed thou fight not against them, nor once move to battle: for I will not give thee of the land of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, because I have given it to the children of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> for a possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> It was accounted a land of giants: and giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a> call Zomzommims,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> A people great and many, and of tall stature, like the Enacims whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed before their face: and he made them to dwell in their stead,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> As he had done in favour of the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">children of Esau</a>, that dwell in Seir, destroying the Horrhites, and delivering their land to them, which they possess to this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The Hevites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, were expelled by the Cappadocians: who came out of Cappadocia, and destroyed them and dwelt in their stead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon: Behold I have delivered into thy hand Sehon king of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a> the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and begin thou to possess his land and make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> that dwell under the whole <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: that when they hear thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> they may fear and tremble, and be in pain like <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in travail.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> So I sent messengers from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Cademoth to Sehon the king of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a> with peaceable words, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> We will pass through thy land, we will go along by the highway: we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Sell us meat for money, that we may eat: give us water for money and so we will drink. We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> As the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">children of Esau</a> have done, that dwell in Seir, and the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>, that abide in Ar: until we come to the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and pass to the land which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> will give us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And Sehon the king of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a> would not let us pass: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> had hardened his spirit, and fixed his heart, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as now thou seest. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hardened, etc...</strong> That is, in punishment of his past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he left him to his own stubborn and perverse disposition, which drew him to his ruin. See the note on <a href="../douay/exo007.htm#verse3">Exodus 7:3</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee Sehon and his land, begin to possess it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at Jasa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> delivered him to us: and we slew him with his sons and all his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And we took all his cities at that time, killing the inhabitants of them, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children. We left nothing of them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them: and the spoils of the cities, which we took:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, a town that is situate in a valley, as far as Galaad. There was not a <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">village</a> or city, that escaped our hands: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> delivered all unto us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Except the land of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, to which we approached not: and all that border upon the torrent Jeboc, and the cities in the mountains, and all the places which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> forbade us.</span></p>
