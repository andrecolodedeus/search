<div class="h1a">Laws relating to war.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> If thou go out to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against thy enemies, and see horsemen and chariots, and the numbers of the enemy's army greater than thine, thou shalt not fear them: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> is with thee, who brought thee out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when the battle is now at hand, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall stand before the army, and shall speak to the people in this manner:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, you join battle this day against your enemies, let not your heart be dismayed, be not afraid, do not give back, fear ye them not:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> is in the midst of you, and will fight for you against your enemies, to deliver you from danger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> shall proclaim through every band in the hearing of the army: What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is there, that hath built a new house, and hath not <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicate</a> it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is there, that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not as yet made it to be common, whereof all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may eat? let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> execute his office.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is there, that hath <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">espoused</a> a wife, and not taken her? let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> After these things are declared they shall add the rest, and shall speak to the people: What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is there that is fearful, and faint hearted? let him go, and return to his house, lest he make the hearts of his brethren to fear, as he himself is possessed with fear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army shall hold their peace, and have made an end of speaking, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall prepare their bands to fight.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> If at any time thou come to fight against a city, thou shalt first offer it peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If they receive it, and open the gates to thee, all the people that are therein, shall be saved, and shall serve thee paying tribute.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But if they will not make peace, and shall begin <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against thee, thou shalt besiege it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall deliver it into thy hands, thou shalt slay all that are therein of the male sex, with the edge of the sword,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Excepting <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, cattle and other things, that are in the city. And thou shalt divide all the prey to the army, and thou shalt eat the spoils of thy enemies, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall give thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So shalt thou do to all cities that are at a great distance from thee, and are not of these cities which thou shalt receive in possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But of those cities that shall be given thee, thou shalt suffer none at all to live:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But shalt <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> them with the edge of the sword, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath commanded thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Lest they teach you to do all the abominations which they have done to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>: and you should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> When thou hast besieged a city a long time, and hath compassed it with bulwarks, to take it, thou shalt not cut down the trees that may be eaten of, neither shalt thou spoil the country round about with axes: for it is a tree, and not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, neither can it increase the number of them that fight against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But if there be any trees that are not fruitful, but wild, and fit for other uses, cut them down, and make engines, until thou take the city, which fighteth against thee.</span></p>
