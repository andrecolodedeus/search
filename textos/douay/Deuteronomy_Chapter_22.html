<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Thou shalt not pass by if thou seest thy brother's ox, or his sheep go astray: but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And if thy brother be not nigh, or thou know him not: thou shalt bring them to thy house, and they shall be with thee until thy brother seek them, and receive them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thou shalt do in like manner with his ass, and with his raiment, and with every thing that is thy brother's, which is lost: if thou find it, neglect it not as pertaining to another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> If thou see thy brother's ass or his ox to be fallen down in the way, thou shalt not slight it, but shalt lift it up with him.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> If thou find as thou walkest by the way, a bird's nest in a tree, or on the ground, and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs: thou shalt not take her with her young: <span class="stiki"><strong>Thou shalt not take, etc...</strong> This was to show them to exercise a certain mercy even to irrational creatures; and by that means to train them up to a horror of cruelty; and to the exercise of humanity and mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> one to another.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But shalt let her go, keeping the young which thou hast caught: that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live a long time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a battlement to the roof round about: lest blood be shed in thy house, and thou be guilty, if any one slip, and fall down headlong. <span class="stiki"><strong>Battlement...</strong> This precaution was necessary, because all their houses had flat tops, and it was usual to walk and to converse together upon them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest both the seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of the vineyard, be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> together.</span>

And they shall spread the cloth before the ancients of the city:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the ancients of that city shall take that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and beat him,</span>
