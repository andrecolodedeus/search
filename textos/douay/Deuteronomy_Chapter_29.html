<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> These are the words of the covenant which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to make with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: beside that covenant which he made with them in <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> called all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and said to them: You have seen all the things that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> did before you in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and to all his servants, and to his whole land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The great temptations, which thy eyes have seen, those mighty <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He hath brought you forty years through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: your garments are not worn out, neither are the shoes of your feet consumed with age.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink: that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And you came to this place: and Sehon king of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and Og king of Basan, came out against us to fight. And we slew them.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which this day the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> maketh with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> That he may raise thee up a people to himself, and he may be thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as he hath spoken to thee, and as he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to thy fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For you know how we dwelt in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and how we have passed through the midst of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and passing through them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> You have seen their abominations and filth, that is to say, their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipped</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Lest perhaps there should be among you a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or a <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>, whose heart is turned away this day from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, to go and serve the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> of those <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>: and there should be among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when he shall hear the words of this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he should <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> himself in his heart saying: I shall have peace, and will walk on in the naughtiness of my heart: and the <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> may consume the thirsty, <span class="stiki"><strong>The drunken, etc., absumat ebria sitientem...</strong> It is a proverbial expression, which may either be understood, as spoken by the sinner, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, that is, flattering himself in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with the imagination of peace, and so great an abundance as may satisfy, and as it were, consume all thirst and want: or it may be referred to the root of bitterness, spoken of before, which being drunken with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may attract, and by that means consume, such as thirst after the like <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> should not forgive him: but his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a> against that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should be exceedingly enkindled at that time, and all the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curses</a> that are written in this volume should light upon him: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> should blot out his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> from under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And utterly destroy him out of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curses</a> that are contained in the book of this <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> and covenant:</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the following <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> shall say, and the children that shall be born hereafter, and the strangers that shall come from afar, seeing the plagues of that land and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> wherewith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath afflicted it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Burning it with brimstone, and the heat of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, so that it cannot be sown any more, nor any green thing grow therein, after the example of the destruction of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom and Gomorrha</a>, Adama and Seboim, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and indignation:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> shall say: Why hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> done thus to this land? what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they shall answer: Because they forsook the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they have served <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> them, whom they knew not, and for whom they had not been assigned:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curses</a> that are written in this volume:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he hath cast them out of their land, in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and in very great indignation, and hath thrown them into a strange land, as it is seen this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Secret things to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>: things that are manifest, to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Secret things, etc...</strong> As much as to say, secret things belong to, and are known to, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; our business must be to observe what he has <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> and manifested to us, and to direct our lives accordingly.</span></span></p>
