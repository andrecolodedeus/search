<div class="h1a">The victory over Og king of Basan. Ruben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh receive their possession on the other side of Jordan.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then we turned and went by the way of Basan: and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in Edrai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Fear him not: because he is delivered into thy hand, with all his people and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, that dwelt in <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> delivered into our hands, Og also, the king of Basan, and all his people: and we utterly destroyed them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Wasting all his cities at one time, there was not a town that escaped us: sixty cities, all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in Basan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with gates and bars, besides innumerable towns that had no walls.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, destroying every city, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, that were beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: from the torrent Arnon unto the mount <a href="../cathen/07288a.htm">Hermon</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Which the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a> call Sarion, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a> Sanir:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> All the cities that are situate in the plain, and all the land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants. His bed of iron is shown, which is in Rabbath of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, being nine cubits long, and four broad after the measure of the cubit of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hand.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, unto the half of mount Galaad: and I gave the cities thereof to <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> and <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, all the country of Argob: and all Basan is called the <em>Land of giants</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Jair the son of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> possessed all the country of Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati. And he called Basan by his own <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this present day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> To Machir also I gave Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And to the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a> of <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> and <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a> I gave of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Arnon, half the torrent, and the confines even unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the plain of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">most salt sea</a>, to the foot of <a href="../cathen/11791a.htm">mount Phasga</a> eastward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I commanded you at that time, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed before your brethren the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, all the strong <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Leaving your wives and children and cattle. For I know you have much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Until the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to you: and they also possess the land, which he will give them beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: then shall every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> return to his possession, which I have given you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I commanded <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> also at that time, saying: Thy eyes have seen what the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> hath done to these two kings: so will he do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt pass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Fear them not: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> will fight for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And I besought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> at that time, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, thou hast begun to show unto thy servant thy greatness, and most mighty hand, for there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> either in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared to thy strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent land beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me on your account and heard me not, but said to me: It is enough: speak no more to me of this matter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Go up to the top of <a href="../cathen/11791a.htm">Phasga</a>, and cast thy eyes round about to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and behold it, for thou shalt not pass this <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Command <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and encourage and strengthen him: for he shall go before this people, and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And we abode in the valley over against the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Phogor.</span></p>
