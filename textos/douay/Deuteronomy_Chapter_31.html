<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> shall be kindled against them in that day: and I will forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured: all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and afflictions shall find them, so that they shall say in that day: In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not with me, that these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> have found me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But I will hide, and cover my face in that day, for all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which they have done, because they have followed <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now therefore write you this <a href="../cathen/03301a.htm">canticle</a>, and teach the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: that they may know it by heart, and sing it by mouth, and this song may be unto me for a testimony among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For I will bring them into the land, for which I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey. And when they have eaten, and are full and fat, they will turn away after <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>, and will serve them: and will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> me, and make void my covenant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And after many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and afflictions shall have come upon them, this canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no oblivion shall take away out of the mouth of their seed.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore wrote the <a href="../cathen/03301a.htm">canticle</a>, and taught it to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>, and said: Take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a>: for thou shalt bring the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> into the land which I have <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>, and I will be with thee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Therefore after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had wrote the words of this <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> in a volume, and finished it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He commanded the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, who carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Take this book, and put it in the side of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: that it may be there for a testimony against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck. While I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: how much more when I shall be dead?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Gather unto me all the ancients of your <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth to witness against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For I know that, after my death, you will do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>, and will quickly turn aside form the way that I have commanded you: and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to provoke him by the works of your hands.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the words of this <a href="../cathen/03301a.htm">canticle</a>, and finished it even to the end.</span></p>
