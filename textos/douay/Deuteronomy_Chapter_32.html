<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be: for it is a perverse <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, and unfaithful children.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> They have provoked me with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">that which was no god</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angered</a> me with their vanities: and I will provoke them with that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> A fire is kindled in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and shall burn even to the lowest <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>: and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the foundations of the mountains.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite: I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both the young man and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, the sucking child with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in years.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> I said: Where are they? I will make the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of them to cease from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But for the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the enemies I have deferred it: lest perhaps their enemies might be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and should say: Our mighty hand, and not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, hath done all these things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> O that they would be wise and would understand, and would provide for their last end.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand? Was it not, because their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had sold them, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had shut them up?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not as their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>: our enemies themselves are judges.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Their vines are of the vineyard of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and of the suburbs of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which is incurable.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants: he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And he shall say: Where are their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>, in whom they trusted?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>: let them arise and help you, and protect you in your distress.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> See ye that I alone am, and there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> besides me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> I will lift up my hand to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and I will say: I live for ever.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment: I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">captivity</a>, of the bare head of the enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> So <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And he ended all these words, speaking to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And he said to them: Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day: which you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfil all that is written in this <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> to possess it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the same day, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Go up into this mountain <a href="../cathen/01006c.htm">Abarim</a>, (that is to say, of passages), unto <a href="../cathen/10729a.htm">mount Nebo</a>, which is in the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> over against <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>: and see the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, which I will deliver to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> to possess, and die thou in the mountain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">people</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, at the waters of contradiction, in <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Sin: and you did not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">sanctify</a> me among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, but thou shalt not enter into it.</span></p>
