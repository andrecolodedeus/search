<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And now, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, hear the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> and judgments which I teach thee: that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering in mayst possess the land which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers will give you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it: keep the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> which I command you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Your eyes have seen all that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath done against <a href="../cathen/02388b.htm">Beelphegor</a>, how he hath destroyed all his <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshippers</a> from among you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But you that adhere to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, are all alive until this present day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> You know that I have taught you <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">statutes</a> and justices, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord my God</a> hath commanded me: so shall you do them in the land which you shall possess:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And you shall observe, and fulfil them in practice. For this is your wisdom, and understanding in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that hearing all these <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, they may say: Behold a wise and understanding people, a great nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath gods so nigh them, as our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is present to all our petitions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For what other nation is there so renowned that hath <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> judgments, and all the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, which I will set forth this day before our eyes?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Keep thyself therefore, and thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> carefully. Forget not the words that thy eyes have seen, and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life. Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy grandsons,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> From the day in which thou didst stand before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> in <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to me, saying: Call together the people unto me, that they may hear my words, and may learn to fear me all the time that they live on the earth, and may teach their children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And you came to the foot of the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, which burned even unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and there was darkness, and a cloud and obscurity in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of his words, but you saw not any form at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he showed you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, and the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">ten words</a> that he wrote in two tables of stone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and judgments which you shall do in the land, that you shall possess.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Keep therefore your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> carefully. You saw not any similitude in the day that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> spoke to you in <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a> from the midst of the fire:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Lest perhaps being <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceived</a> you might make you a <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven similitude</a>, or image of male or female,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The similitude of any beasts, that are upon the earth, or of birds, that fly under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Or of creeping things, that move on the earth, or of fishes, that abide in the waters under the earth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, thou see the sun and the moon, and all the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and being <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceived</a> by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> thou <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> and serve them, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for the service of all the nations, that are under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath taken you and brought you out of the iron furnaces of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to make you his people of inheritance, as it is this present day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me for your words, and he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> that I should not pass over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, nor enter into the excellent land, which he will give you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Behold I die in this land, I shall not pass over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: you shall pass, and possess the goodly land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, which he hath made with thee: and make to thyself a <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven likeness</a> of those things which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath forbid to be made:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> is a consuming fire, a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> If you shall beget sons and grandsons, and abide in the land, and being <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceived</a>, make to yourselves any <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">similitude</a>, committing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, to provoke him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> I call this day <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth to witness, that you shall quickly perish out of the land, which, when you have passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, you shall possess. You shall not dwell therein long, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will destroy you,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And scatter you among all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and you shall remain a few among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall lead you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And there you shall serve <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>, that were framed with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> hands: wood and stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when thou shalt seek there the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, thou shalt find him: yet so, if thou seek him with all thy heart, and all the affliction of thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> After all the things aforesaid shall find thee, in the latter time thou shalt return to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and shalt hear his voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> is a merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: he will not leave thee, nor altogether destroy thee, nor forget the covenant, by which he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to thy fathers.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Ask of the days of old, that have been before thy time from the day that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> upon the earth, from one end of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to the other end thereof, if ever there was done the like thing, or it hath been known at any time,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> That a people should hear the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaking out of the midst of fire, as thou hast heard, and lived:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ever did so as to go, and take to himself a nation out of the midst of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> by temptations, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs, and wonders</a>, by fight, and a strong hand, and stretched out arm, and horrible <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> according to all the things that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> did for you in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, before thy eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> That thou mightest know that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no other besides him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> From <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> he made thee to hear his voice, that he might teach thee. And upon earth he showed thee his exceeding great fire, and thou didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Because he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> thy fathers, and chose their seed after them. And he brought thee out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, going before thee with his great power,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> To destroy at thy coming very great <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and stronger than thou art, and to bring thee in, and give thee their land for a possession, as thou seest at this present day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Know therefore this day, and think in thy heart that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> above, and in the earth beneath, and there is no other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Keep his <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> and <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, which I command thee: that it may be well with thee, and thy children after thee, and thou mayst remain a long time upon the land, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will give thee.</span></p>
