<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> called all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and said to them: Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and judgments, which I speak in your ears this day: learn them, and fulfil them in work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> made a covenant with us in <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He made not the covenant with our fathers, but with us, who are now present and living.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He spoke to us face to face in the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a> out of the midst of fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I was the mediator and stood between the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and you at that time, to show you his words, for you feared the fire, and went not up into the mountain, and he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, who brought thee out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, out of the house of <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Thou shalt not have <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a> in my sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thou shalt not make to thy self a <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven thing</a>, nor the likeness of any things, that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> above, or that are in the earth beneath, or that abide in the waters under the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them, and thou shalt not serve them. For I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, visiting the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And showing mercy unto many thousands, to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me, and keep my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</a>: for he shall not be unpunished that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">taketh his name</a> upon a vain thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Observe the day of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, to sanctify it, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath commanded thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy works.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The seventh is the day of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, that is, the rest of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>. Thou shalt not do any work therein, thou nor thy son nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy beasts, nor the stranger that is within thy gates: that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest, even as thyself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Remember that thou also didst serve in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> brought thee out from thence with a strong hand, and a stretched out arm. Therefore hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">Honour</a> thy <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath commanded thee, that thou mayst live a long time, and it may be well with thee in the land, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will give thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Neither shalt thou commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Neither shalt thou <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">bear false witness</a> against thy neighbour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> thy neighbour's wife: nor his house, nor his field, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">thing</a> that is his.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> These <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">words</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to all the multitude of you in the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mountain</a>, out of the midst of the fire and the cloud, and the darkness, with a loud voice, adding nothing more: and he wrote them in two tables of stone, which he delivered unto me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But you, after you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, and saw the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mountain</a> burn, came to me, all the princes of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a> and the elders, and you said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> hath shown us his majesty and his greatness, we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire, and have proved this day that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaking with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath lived.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Why shall we die therefore, and why shall this exceeding great fire consume us: for if we hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> any more, we shall die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> What is all flesh, that it should hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, who speaketh out of the midst of the fire, as we have heard, and be able to live?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Approach thou rather: and hear all things that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> shall say to thee, and thou shalt speak to us, and we will hear and will do them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had heard this, he said to me: I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they spoke to thee: they have spoken all things well.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Who shall give them to have such a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to fear me, and to keep all my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> at all times, that it may be well with them and with their children for ever?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Go and say to them: Return into your tents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But stand thou here with me, and I will speak to thee all my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and judgments: which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land, which I will give them for a possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Keep therefore and do the things which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commanded</a> you: you shall not go aside neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But you shall walk in the way that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> hath commanded, that you may live, and it may be well with you, and your days may be long in the land of your possession.</span></p>
