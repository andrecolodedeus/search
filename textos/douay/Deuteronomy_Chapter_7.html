<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> When the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall have brought thee into the land, which thou art going in to possess, and shall have destroyed many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> before thee, the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and the Gergezite, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, seven <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> much more numerous than thou art, and stronger than thou:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy them. Thou shalt make no league with them, nor show mercy to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Neither shalt thou make <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriages</a> with them. Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for thy son:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For she will turn away thy son from following me, that he may rather serve <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will be kindled, and will quickly destroy thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But thus rather shall you deal with them: Destroy their <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>, and break their <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">statues</a>, and cut down their groves, and burn their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven things</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Because thou art a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Not because you surpass all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> in number, is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> joined unto you, and hath chosen you, for you are the fewest of any people:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And thou shalt know that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, he is a strong and faithful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, and to them that keep his <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, unto a thousand <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And repaying forthwith them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him, so as to destroy them, without further delay immediately rendering to them what they deserve.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Keep therefore the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and judgments, which I command thee this day to do.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> If after thou hast heard these judgments, thou keep and do them, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will also keep his covenant to thee, and the mercy which he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to thy fathers:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thee and multiply thee, and will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy vintage, thy oil, and thy herds, and the flocks of thy sheep upon the land, for which he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to thy fathers that he would give it thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> shalt thou be among all people. No one shall be barren among you of either sex, neither of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> nor cattle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will take away from thee all sickness: and the <a href="../cathen/12143a.htm">grievous infirmities</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a>, he will not bring upon thee, but upon thy enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thou shalt consume all the people, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will deliver to thee.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> If thou say in thy heart: These <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> are more than I, how shall I be able to destroy them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Fear not, but remember what the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> did to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> and to all the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The exceeding great <a href="../cathen/12143a.htm">plagues</a>, which thy eyes saw, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a>, and the strong hand, and the stretched out arm, with which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> brought thee out: so will he do to all the people, whom thou fearest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Moreover the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> will send also hornets among them, until he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee, and could hide themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Thou shalt not fear them, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> is in the midst of thee, a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> mighty and terrible:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little and by degrees. Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether: lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall deliver them in thy sight: and shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> from under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>: no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be able to resist thee, until thou destroy them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven things</a> thou shalt burn with fire: thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the silver and gold of which they are made, neither shalt thou take to thee any thing thereof, lest thou offend, because it is an abomination to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Graven things...</strong> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">Idols</a>, so called by contempt.</span></span>
