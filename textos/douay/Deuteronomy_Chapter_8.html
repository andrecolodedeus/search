<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And thou shalt remember all the way through which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath brought thee for forty years through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were known in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep his <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> or no.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And was thy leader in the great and terrible <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, wherein there was the serpent burning with his breath, and the scorpion and the <em>dipsas</em>, and no waters at all: who brought forth streams out of the hardest rock, <span class="stiki"><strong>The Dipsas...</strong> A serpent whose bite causeth a violent thirst; from whence it has its name, for in Greek <em>dipsa</em> signifies thirst.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And fed thee in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> with <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> which thy fathers knew not. And after he had afflicted and proved thee, at the last he had mercy on thee,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart: My own might, and the strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But remember the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, that he hath given thee strength, that he might fulfil his covenant, concerning which he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to thy fathers, as this present day showeth.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> As the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed at thy entrance, so shall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span></p>
