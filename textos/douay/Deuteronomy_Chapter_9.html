<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> A people great and tall, the sons of the Enacims, whom thou hast seen, and heard of, against whom no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is able to stand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thou shalt know therefore this day that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> himself will pass over before thee, a devouring and consuming fire, to destroy and extirpate and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly, as he hath spoken to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Say not in thy heart, when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> brought me in to possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For it is not for thy justices, and the uprightness of thy heart that thou shalt go in to possess their lands: but because they have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>, they are destroyed at thy coming in: and that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> might accomplish his word, which he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to thy fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Remember, and forget not how thou provokedst the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>. From the day that thou camest out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> unto this place, thou hast always strove against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For in <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Horeb</a>, also thou didst provoke him, and he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and would have destroyed thee,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> When I went up into the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a> to receive the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">tables of stone</a>, the tables of the covenant which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> made with you: and I continued in the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a> forty days and nights, neither eating bread, nor drinking water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave me two <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">tables of stone</a> written with the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and containing all the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">words</a> that he spoke to you in the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a> from the midst of the fire, when the people were assembled together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when forty days were passed, and as many nights, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave me the two <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">tables of stone</a>, the tables of the covenant,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And said to me: Arise, and go down from hence quickly: for thy people, which thou hast brought out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, have quickly forsaken the way that thou hast shown them, and have made to themselves a <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">molten idol</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And again the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: I see that this people is stiffnecked:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Let me alone that I may destroy them, and abolish their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> from under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and set thee over a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nation</a>, that is greater and stronger than this.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when I came down from the burning <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, and held the two <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">tables</a> of the covenant with both hands,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And saw that you had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, and had made to yourselves a <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">molten calf</a>, and had quickly forsaken his way, which he had shown you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I cast the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">tables</a> out of my hands, and broke them in your sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I fell down before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> as before, forty days and nights <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">neither eating bread</a>, nor drinking water, for all your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which you had committed against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and had provoked him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For I feared his indignation and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, wherewith being moved against you, he would have destroyed you. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard me this time also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he was exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> also, and would have destroyed him, and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in like manner for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that you had committed, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">calf</a>, I took, and burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until it was as small as dust, I threw it into the torrent, which cometh down from the mountain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> At the <em>burning</em> also, and at the <em>place of temptation</em>, and at the <em>graves of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a></em> you provoked the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when he sent you from <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cadesbarne</a>, saying: Go up, and possess the land that I have given you, and you slighted the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, and did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him, neither would you hearken to his voice:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But were always rebellious from the day that I began to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And I lay prostrate before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> forty days and nights, in which I humbly besought him, that he would not destroy you as he had threatened:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, I said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, destroy not thy people, and thy inheritance, which thou hast <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a> in thy greatness, whom thou hast brought out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with a strong hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Remember thy servants <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: look not on the stubbornness of this people, nor on their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which thou hast brought us, say: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> could not bring them into the land that he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> them, and he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them: therefore he brought them out, that he might <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Who are thy people and thy inheritance, whom thou hast brought out by thy great strength, and in thy stretched out arm.</span></p>
