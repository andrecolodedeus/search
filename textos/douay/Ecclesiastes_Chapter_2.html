<h1>Ecclesiastes Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">The vanity of pleasures, riches, and worldly labours.</div>

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. And I saw that this also was vanity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Laughter I counted <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, that I might turn my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of kings, and provinces: I made me singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and singing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and the delights of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">sons of men</a>, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I surpassed in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> all that were before me in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: my wisdom also remained with me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I passed further to behold wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and folly, (What is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, said I that he can follow the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">King his maker</a>?)</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The eyes of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I perceived that this also was vanity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool forever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and all vanity and vexation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Again I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under the sun, being like to have an heir after me,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether he will be a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or a fool, and he shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and is there anything so vain?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring anymore under the sun.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For when a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> laboureth in wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: so this also is vanity, and a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For what profit shall a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have of all his labour, and vexation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, with which he hath been tormented under the sun?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> All his days are full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth not rest in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: and is not this vanity?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Is it not better to eat and drink, and to show his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of his labours? and this is from the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in his sight, wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and superfluous care, to heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</span></blockquote>
