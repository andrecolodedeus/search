<div class="h1a">Other instances of human miseries.</div>

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that are done under the sun, and the tears of the innocent, and they had no comforter; and they were not able to resist their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, being destitute of help from any.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I praised the dead rather than the living:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I judged him <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happier</a> than them both, that is not yet born, nor hath seen the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that are done under the sun.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Again I considered all the labours of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and I remarked that their industries are exposed to the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of their neighbour: so in this also there is vanity, and fruitless care.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh, saying:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Better is a handful with rest, than both hands full with labour, and vexation of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Considering I found also another vanity under the sun:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother, and yet he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, neither doth he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">defraud</a> my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? in this also is vanity, and a grievous vexation.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> It is better therefore that two should be together, than one: for they have the advantage of their society:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> If one fall he shall be supported by the other: woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth, he hath none to lift him up.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And if two lie together, they shall warm one another: how shall one alone be warmed?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> prevail against one, two shall withstand him: a threefold cord is not easily broken.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Better is a child that is <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and wise, than a king that is old and foolish, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not to foresee for hereafter.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Because out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and chains sometimes a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cometh forth to a kingdom: and another born king is consumed with <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I saw all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> living, that walk under the sun with the second young man, who shall rise up in his place.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The number of the people, of all that were before him is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: and they that shall come afterwards, shall not rejoice in him: but this also is vanity, and vexation of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Keep thy foot, when thou goest into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, and draw nigh to hear. For much better is <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, than the victims of fools, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they do.</span></blockquote>
