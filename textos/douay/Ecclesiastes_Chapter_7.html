<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> What needeth a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to seek things that are above him, whereas he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not what is profitable for him in his life, in all the days of his pilgrimage, and the time that passeth like a shadow? Or who can tell him what shall be after him under the sun?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> A <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a> is better than precious <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointments</a>: and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting: for in that we are put in mind of the end of all, and the living thinketh what is to come.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">Anger</a> is better than laughter: because by the sadness of the countenance the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the offender is corrected. <span class="stiki"><strong>Anger...</strong> That is, correction, or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of fools where there is mirth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> It is better to be rebuked by a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, than to be deceived by the flattery of fools.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For as the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool: now this also is vanity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Oppression troubleth the wise, and shall destroy the strength of his heart.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Better is the end of a speech than the beginning. Better is the patient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than the <a href="../cathen/12403b.htm">presumptuous</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Be not quickly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> resteth in the bosom of a fool.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Say not: What thinkest thou is the cause that former times were better than they are now? for this manner of question is foolish.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wisdom with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> is more profitable, and bringeth more advantage to them that see the sun.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For as wisdom is a defence, so money is a defence: but learning and wisdom excel in this, that they give life to him that possesseth them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Consider the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can correct whom he hath <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> In the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> day enjoy <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and beware beforehand of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made both the one and the other, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may not find against him any <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> complaint.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> These things also I saw in the days of my vanity: A <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perisheth in his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> liveth a long time in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Be not over <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: and be not more wise than is necessary, lest thou become stupid. <span class="stiki"><strong>Over just...</strong> Viz., By an excessive rigour in censuring the ways of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in bearing with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Be not overmuch <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: and be not foolish, lest thou die before thy time. <span class="stiki"><strong>Be not overmuch wicked...</strong> That is, lest by the greatness of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> you leave no room for mercy.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that thou shouldst hold up the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, yea and from him withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neglecteth nothing.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Wisdom hath strengthened the wise more than ten princes of the city.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For there is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> upon earth, that doth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But do not apply thy heart to all words that are spoken: lest perhaps thou hear thy servant reviling thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For thy <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> that thou also hast often spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of others.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> I have tried all things in wisdom. I have said: I will be wise: and it departed farther from me,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Much more than it was: it is a great depth, who shall find it out?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> I have surveyed all things with my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and consider, and seek out wisdom and reason: and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the fool, and the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the imprudent:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And I have found a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> more bitter than death, who is the hunter's snare, and her heart is a net, and her hands are bands. He that pleaseth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall escape from her: but he that is a sinner, shall be caught by her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Lo this have I found, said Ecclesiastes, weighing one thing after another, that I might find out the account,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Which yet my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> seeketh, and I have not found it.
