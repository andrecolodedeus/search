<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The wisdom of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shineth in his countenance, and the most mighty will change his face.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I observe the mouth of the king, and the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Be not hasty to depart from his face, and do not continue in an <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil work</a>: for he will do all that pleaseth him:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And his word is full of power: neither can any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> say to him: Why dost thou so?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He that keepeth the commandment, shall find no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The heart of a wiser <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> understandeth <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and answer.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> There is a time and opportunity for every business, and great affliction for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Because he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of things past, and things to come he cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by any messenger.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> It is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power to stop the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, neither hath he power in the day of death, neither is he suffered to rest when <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is at hand, neither shall <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> save the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> All these things I have considered, and applied my heart to all the works that are done under the sun. Sometimes one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ruleth over another to his own hurt.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> I saw the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> buried: who also when they were yet living were in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">holy place</a>, and were praised in the city as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> works: but this also is vanity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> commit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> without any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But though a sinner do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> a hundred times, and by patience be borne withal, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from thence that it shall be well with them that fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who dread his face.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But let it not be well with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, neither let his days be prolonged, but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> There is also another vanity, which is done upon the earth. There are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> happen, as though they had done the works of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: and there are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who are as secure as though they had the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: but this also I judge most vain.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Therefore I commended mirth, because there was no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under the sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry, and that he should take nothing else with him of his labour in the days of his life, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given him under the sun. <span class="stiki"><strong>No good for a man, etc...</strong> Some <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> think the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> here speaks in the person of the libertine: representing the objections of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> against <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, and the inferences they draw from thence, which he takes care afterwards to refute. But it may also be said, that his meaning is to commend the moderate <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">use of the goods of this world</a>, preferably to the cares and solicitudes of worldlings, their attachment to vanity and curiosity, and presumptuously diving into the unsearchable ways of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And I applied my heart to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> wisdom, and to understand the distraction that is upon earth: for there are some that day and night take no sleep with their eyes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And I understood that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can find no reason of all those works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that are done under the sun: and the more he shall labour to seek, so much the less shall he find: yea, though the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall say, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> it, he shall not be able to find it.</span></blockquote>
