<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I turned me to another thing, and I saw that under the sun, the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> to the learned, nor favour to the skilful: but <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and chance in all.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> This wisdom also I have seen under the sun, and it seemed to me to be very great:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> A little city, and few <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in it: there came against it a great king, and invested it, and built bulwarks round about it, and the siege was perfect.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now there was found in it a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and wise, and he delivered the city by his wisdom, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> afterward remembered that <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And I said that wisdom is better than strength: how then is the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> slighted, and his words not heard?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The words of the wise are heard in silence, more than the cry of a prince among fools.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Better is wisdom, than weapons of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and he that shall offend in one, shall lose many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</span></blockquote>
