<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Be ye therefore followers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as most dear children:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And walk in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also hath <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> us and hath delivered himself for us, an <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for an odour of sweetness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But fornication and all <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Or obscenity or foolish talking or scurrility, which is to no purpose: but rather giving of thanks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you this and understand: That no fornicator or <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (which is a serving of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>) hath inheritance in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon the children of unbelief.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. Walk then as children of the light.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For the fruit of the light is in all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Proving what is well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">works of darkness</a>: but rather reprove them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for all that is made manifest is light.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Wherefore he saith: Rise, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall enlighten thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But as wise: <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeeming</a> the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, because the days are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Wherefore, become not unwise: but understanding what is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And be not <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunk with wine</a>, wherein is luxury: but be ye filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Speaking to yourselves in <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psalms</a> and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and <a href="../cathen/03301a.htm">spiritual canticles</a>, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Giving thanks always for all things, in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God and the Father</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Being subject one to another, in the fear of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Let <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> be subject to their husbands, as to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Because the husband is the head of the wife, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. He is the saviour of his body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Therefore as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things. <span class="stiki"><strong>As the church is subject to Christ...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> then, according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, is ever <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and can never fall from him, but remain faithful to him, unspotted and unchanged to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> and delivered himself up for it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">laver of water</a> in the word of life:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> That he might present it to himself, a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and without blemish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So also ought <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their wives as their own bodies. He that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> his wife <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> doth the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Because we are members of him, body, of his flesh and of his bones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For this cause shall a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> leave his father and mother: and shall cleave to his wife. And they shall be two in one flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> This is a great <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: but I speak in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for his wife as himself: And let the wife fear her husband.</span></p>
