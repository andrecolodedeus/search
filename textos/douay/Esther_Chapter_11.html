<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levitical race</a>, and Ptolemy his son brought this <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> of <a href="../cathen/12580b.htm">Phurim</a>, which they said Lysimachus the son of Ptolemy had interpreted in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great, in the first day of the month Nisan, Mardochai the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> A <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> who dwelt in the city of <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a>, a great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and among the first of the king's <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, had a dream.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now he was of the number of the captives, whom <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon</a> had carried away from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with Jechonias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And this was his dream: Behold there were voices, and tumults, and thunders, and earthquakes, and a disturbance upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And behold two great dragons came forth ready to fight one against another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And at their cry all nations were stirred up to fight against the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And that was a day of darkness and danger, of tribulation and distress, and great fear upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> was troubled fearing their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and was prepared for death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they cried to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and as they were crying, a little fountain grew into a very great river, and abounded into many waters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The light and the sun rose up, and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> were exalted, and they devoured the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when Mardochai had seen this, and arose out of his bed, he was thinking what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would do: and he kept it fixed in his mind, desirous to know what the dream should signify.</span></p>
