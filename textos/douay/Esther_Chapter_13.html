<h1>Esther Chapter 13</h1>
<div class="h1a">A copy of a letter sent by Aman to destroy the Jews. Mardochai's prayer for the people.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And this was the copy of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>: Artaxerxes the great king who reigneth from India to <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, to the princes and governors of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, that are subject to his empire, greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Whereas I reigned over many nations, and had brought all the world under my dominion, I was not willing to abuse the greatness of my power, but to govern my subjects with clemency and that they might live quietly without any terror, and might enjoy peace, which is desired by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But when I asked my counsellors how this might be accomplished, one that excelled the rest in wisdom and fidelity, and was second after the king, Aman by <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Told me that there was a people <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a> through the whole world, which used new laws, and acted against the customs of all nations, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> the commandments of kings, and violated by their opposition the concord of all nations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Wherefore having learned this, and seeing one nation in opposition to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> using perverse laws, and going against our commandments, and disturbing the peace and concord of the provinces subject to us,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> We have commanded that all whom Aman shall mark out, who is chief over all the provinces, and second after the king, and whom we honour as a father, shall be utterly destroyed by their enemies, with their wives and children, and that none shall have pity on them, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a> of this present year:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> That these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> going down to hell in one day, may restore to our empire the peace which they had disturbed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But Mardochai besought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, remembering all his works,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, almighty king, for all things are in thy power, and there is none that can resist thy will, if thou determine to save <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Thou hast made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth and all things that are under the cope of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Thou art <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that it was not out of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and or any desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that I refused to worship the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> Aman,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> (For I would willingly and readily for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> have <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> even the steps of his feet),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But I feared lest I should transfer the honour of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and lest I should <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> any one except my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And now, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, O king, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, have mercy on thy people, because our enemies resolve to destroy us, and extinguish thy inheritance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Despise not thy portion, which thou hast <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a> for thyself out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Hear my supplication, and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance, and turn our mourning into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that we may live and praise thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with like mind and supplication cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, because they saw certain death hanging over their heads.</span></p>
