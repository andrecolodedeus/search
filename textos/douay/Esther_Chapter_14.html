<div class="h1a">The prayer of Esther for herself and her people.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Queen Esther also, fearing the danger that was at hand, had recourse to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when she had laid away her royal apparel, she put on garments suitable for weeping and mourning: instead of divers precious <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointments</a>, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> her body with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>: and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who alone art our king, help me a desolate <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and who have no other helper but thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> My danger is in my hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I have heard of my father that thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, didst take <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from among all nations, and our fathers from all their predecessors, to possess them as an everlasting inheritance, and thou hast done to them as thou hast <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in thy sight, and therefore thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For we have worshipped their gods. Thou art <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> They design to change thy <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a>, and destroy thy inheritance, and shut the mouths of them that praise thee, and extinguish the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of thy <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> That they may open the mouths of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and praise the strength of idols, and magnify for ever a carnal king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Give not, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thy sceptre to them that are not, lest they laugh at our ruin: but turn their counsel upon themselves, and destroy him that hath begun to rage against us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Remember, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and show thyself to us in the time of our tribulation, and give me boldness, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, king of gods, and of all power:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of our enemy, that both he himself may perish, and the rest that consent to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But deliver us by thy hand, and help me, who have no other helper, but thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who hast the knowledge of all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And thou knowest that I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the wicked, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thou knowest my necessity, that I abominate the sign of my <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is upon my head in the days of my public appearance, and detest it as a menstruous rag, and wear it not in the days of my silence,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And that I have not eaten at Aman's table, nor hath the king's banquet pleased me, and that I have not drunk the wine of the drink <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced, since I was brought hither unto this day but in thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that have no other hope, and deliver us from the hand of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear.</span></p>
