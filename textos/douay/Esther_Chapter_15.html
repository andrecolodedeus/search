<h1>Esther Chapter 15</h1>
<div class="h1a">Esther comes into the king's presence: she is terrified, but God turns his heart.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he commanded her (no doubt but he was Mardochai) to go to the king, and petition for her people, and for her country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Remember, (said he), the days of thy low estate, how thou wast brought up by my hand, because Aman the second after the king hath spoken against us unto death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And do thou call upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and speak to the king for us, and deliver us from death.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And on the third day she laid away the garments she wore, and put on her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> apparel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And glittering in royal robes, after she had called upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the ruler and Saviour of all, she took two maids with her,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And upon one of them she leaned, as if for delicateness and overmuch tenderness she were not able to bear up her own body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the other maid followed her lady, bearing up her train flowing on the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But she with a rosy colour in her face, and with gracious and bright eyes hid a mind full of anguish, and exceeding great fear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So going in she passed through all doors in order, and stood before the king, where he sat upon his royal throne, clothed with his royal robes, and glittering with gold, and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>, and he was terrible to behold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when he had lifted up his countenance, and with burning eyes had shown the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of his heart, the queen sunk down, and her colour turned pale, and she rested her weary head upon her handmaid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> changed the king's spirit into mildness, and all in haste and in fear he leaped from his throne, and holding her up in his arms, till she came to herself, caressed her with these words:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother, fear not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Come near then, and touch the sceptre.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy face is full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.</span></p>
