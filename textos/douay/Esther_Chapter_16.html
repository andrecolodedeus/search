<h1>Esther Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">A copy of the king's letter in favour of the Jews.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The great king Artaxerxes, from India to <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, to the governors and princes of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, which <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> our command, sendeth greeting.
 <span class="stiki"><strong>From India to Ethiopia...</strong> That is, who reigneth from <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> to <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Many have abused unto <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> the goodness of princes, and the honour that hath been bestowed upon them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And not only endeavour to oppress the king's subjects, but not bearing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that is given them, take in hand, to practise also against them that gave it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Neither are they content not to return thanks for benefits received, and to violate in themselves the laws of humanity, but they think they can also escape the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who seeth all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they break out into so great madness, as to endeavour to undermine by <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lies</a> such as observe diligently the offices committed to them, and do all things in such manner as to be worthy of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> praise,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> While with crafty <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> they deceive the ears of princes that are well meaning, and judge of others by their own nature.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now this is proved both from ancient histories, and by the things which are done daily, how the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> designs of kings are depraved by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suggestions of certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Neither must you think, if we command different things, that it cometh of the levity of our mind, but that we give sentence according to the quality and necessity of times, as the profit of the commonwealth requireth.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now that you may more plainly understand what we say, Aman the son of Amadathi, a Macedonian both in mind and country, and having nothing of the Persian blood, but with his cruelty staining our goodness, was received being a stranger by us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And found our humanity so great towards him, that he was called our father, and was worshipped by all as the next <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after the king:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But he was so far puffed up with arrogancy, as to go about to deprive us of our kingdom and life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For with certain new and unheard of devices he hath sought the destruction of Mardochai, by whose fidelity and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> services our life was saved, and of Esther the partner of our kingdom with all their nation:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Thinking that after they were slain, he might work treason against us left alone without friends, and might transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But we have found that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who were by that most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> appointed to be slain, are in no fault at all, but contrariwise, use <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> laws,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And are the children of the highest and the greatest, and the ever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, by whose benefit the kingdom was given both to our fathers and to us, and is kept unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Wherefore know ye that those <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> which he sent in our <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, are void and of no effect.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For which crime both he himself that devised it, and all his kindred hang on gibbets, before the gates of this city <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a>: not we, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> repaying him as he deserved.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But this edict, which we now send, shall be published in all cities, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> may freely follow their own laws.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared themselves to kill them, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For the almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath turned this day of sadness and mourning into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival days, and celebrate it with all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that it may be known also in times to come,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> That all they who faithfully <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Persians, receive a worthy reward for their fidelity: but they that are traitors to their kingdom, are destroyed for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And let every province and city, that will not be partaker of this solemnity, perish by the sword and by fire, and be destroyed in such manner as to be made unpassable, both to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and beasts, for an example of contempt, and disobedience.</span></p>
