<h1>Esther Chapter 3</h1>
<div class="h1a">Aman, advanced by the king, is offended at Mardochai, and therefore procures the king's decree to destroy the whole nation of the Jews.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things, <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">king Assuerus</a> advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And all the king's servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king's servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king's commandment?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">Assuerus</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">Assuerus</a>, the lot was cast into an urn, which in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Aman said to <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">king Assuerus</a>: There is a people <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a> through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and moreover <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> the king's ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If it please thee, decree that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the king's scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same mouth: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king's lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">king Assuerus</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>, sealed with his ring,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Were sent by the king's messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, both young and old, little children, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a>, and to make a spoil of their goods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the contents of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the king's commandment. And immediately the edict was hung up in <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a>, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were in the city weeping.</span></p>
