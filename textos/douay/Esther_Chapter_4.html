<h1>Esther Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">Mardochai desires Esther to petition the king for the Jews. They join in fasting and prayer.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, strewing ashes on his head and he cried with a loud voice in the street in the midst of the city, showing the anguish of his mind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a> might enter the king's <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king's cruel edict was come, there was great mourning among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, wailing, and weeping, many using <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a> and ashes for their bed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then Esther's maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>: but he would not receive it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the king's treasures, to have the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a>, that he should show it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to entreat him for her people.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, cometh into the king's inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when Mardochai had heard this,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king's house, more than all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father's house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Go, and gather together all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> whom thou shalt find in <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him.</span></p>
