<h1>Esther Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">The king hearing of the good service done him by Mardochai, commands Aman to honour him next to the king, which he performs.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and chronicles of former times to be brought him. And when they were reading them before him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> They came to that place where it was written, how Mardochai had discovered the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs, who sought to kill <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">king Assuerus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai received for this fidelity? His servants and ministers said to him: He hath received no reward at all. <span class="stiki"><strong>No reward at all...</strong> He received some presents from the king (<a href="../douay/est012.htm#verse5">Esther 12:5</a>); but these were so inconsiderable in the opinion of the courtiers, that they esteemed them as nothing at all.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the king said immediately: Who is in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>? for Aman was coming in to the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the king's house, to speak to the king, that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet, which was prepared for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The servants answered: Aman standeth in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and the king said: Let him come in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Answered: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom the king desireth to honour,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Ought to be clothed with the king's apparel, and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon, and to have the royal crown upon his head,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And let the first of the king's princes and nobles hold his horse, and going through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say: Thus shall he be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, who sitteth before the gates of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed: This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his house, mourning and having his head covered:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai be of the seed of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> As they were yet speaking, the king's eunuchs came, and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared.</span></p>
