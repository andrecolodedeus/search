<h1>Esther Chapter 9</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Jews kill their enemies that would have killed them. The days of Phurim are appointed to be kept holy.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above is called <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a>, when all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries. <span class="stiki"><strong>To revenge, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on this occasion, by authority from the king, were made executioners of the public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, for punishing by <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> a crime worthy of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, viz., a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malicious</a> conspiracy for extirpating their whole nation.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone through every people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and every one in dignity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for fear of Mardochai:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and the fame of his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> increased daily, and was spread abroad through all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> mouths.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Insomuch that even in <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a> they killed five hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> are these:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And presently the number of them that were killed in <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a> was brought to the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said to the queen: The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have killed five hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the city of <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a>, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to do tomorrow in <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a> as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict was hung up in <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a>, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And on the fourteenth day of the month <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gathered themselves together, and they killed in <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a> three hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: but they took not their substance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king's dominion the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were killed amounted to seventy-five thousand, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> took any of their goods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now the thirteenth day of the month <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a> was the first day with them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and banquets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But they that were killing in the city of <a href="../cathen/14344a.htm">Susan</a>, were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And therefore they appointed that day to be a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of feasting and gladness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that dwelt in towns not walled and in <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>, appointed the fourteenth day of the month <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a> for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that abode in all the king's provinces, both those that lay near and those afar off,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a> for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> days, and always at the return of the year should celebrate them with solemn honour:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Because on those days the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats, and should give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">gifts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which Mardochai by <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> had commanded to be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, had devised <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against them, to kill them and destroy them; and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king's <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he had intended against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And since that time these days are called <a href="../cathen/12580b.htm">Phurim</a>, that is, of lots: because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a>, that is, of this book:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times require, as the years continually succeed one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>: neither is there any city wherein the days of <a href="../cathen/12580b.htm">Phurim</a>, that is, of lots, must not be observed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and by their posterity, which is bound to these <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, wrote also a second <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a>, that with all diligence this day should be established a festival for the time to come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they sent to all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">king Assuerus</a>, that they should have peace, and receive <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in their proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by themselves and by their seed, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and cries, and the days of lots,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And all things which are contained in the history of this book, which is called Esther.</span></p>
