<h1>Exodus</h1>

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Book of Moses</a> is called <em>Exodus</em>, from the Greek word <em>Exodos</em>, which signifies going out: because it contains the history of the going out of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, from the words with which it begins, call it <em>Veelle Semoth</em>: <em>These are the names</em>. It contains transactions for 145 years; that is, from the death of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> to the erecting of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">PENTATEUCH</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/exo001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> The Israelites are multiplied in Egypt. They are oppressed by a new king, who commandeth all their male children to be killed.
<br><a href="../douay/exo002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> Moses is born and exposed on the bank of the river; where he is taken up by the daughter of Pharao, and adopted for her son. He killeth an Egyptian, and fleeth into Madian; where he marrieth a wife.
<br><a href="../douay/exo003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> God appeareth to Moses in a bush, and sendeth him to deliver Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/exo004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Moses is empowered to confirm his mission with miracles: his brother Aaron is appointed to assist him.
<br><a href="../douay/exo005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> Pharao refuseth to let the people go. They are more oppressed.
<br><a href="../douay/exo006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> God reneweth his promise. The genealogies of Ruben, Simon and Levi, down to Moses and Aaron.
<br><a href="../douay/exo007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> Moses and Aaron go into Pharao: they turn the rod into a serpent; and the waters of Egypt into blood, which was the first plague. The magicians do the like, and Pharao's heart is hardened.
<br><a href="../douay/exo008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> The second plague is of frogs: Pharao promiseth to let the Israelites go, but breaketh his promise. The third plague is of sciniphs. The fourth is of flies. Pharao again promiseth to dismiss the people, but doth it not.
<br><a href="../douay/exo009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> The fifth plague is a murrain among the cattle. The sixth, of boils in men and beasts. The seventh, of hail. Pharao promiseth again to let the people go, and breaketh his word.
<br><a href="../douay/exo010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> The eighth plague of the locusts. The ninth, of darkness: Pharao is still hardened.
<br><a href="../douay/exo011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> Pharao and his people are threatened with the death of their firstborn.
<br><a href="../douay/exo012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> The manner of preparing, and eating the paschal lamb: the firstborn of Egypt are all slain: the Israelites depart.
<br><a href="../douay/exo013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> The paschal solemnity is to be observed; and the firstborn are to be consecrated to God. The people are conducted through the desert by a pillar of fire in the night, and a cloud in the day.
<br><a href="../douay/exo014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> Pharao pursueth the children of Israel. They murmur against Moses, but are encouraged by him, and pass through the Red Sea. Pharao and his army following them are drowned.
<br><a href="../douay/exo015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> The canticle of Moses. The bitter waters of Mara are made sweet.
<br><a href="../douay/exo016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> The people murmur for want of meat: God giveth them quails and manna.
<br><a href="../douay/exo017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> The people murmur again for want of drink; the Lord giveth them water out of a rock. Moses lifting up his hand in prayer, Amalec is overcome.
<br><a href="../douay/exo018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> Jethro bringeth to Moses his wife and children. His counsel.
<br><a href="../douay/exo019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> They come to Sinai: the people are commanded to be sanctified. The Lord, coming in thunder and lightning, speaketh with Moses.
<br><a href="../douay/exo020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> The ten commandments.
<br><a href="../douay/exo021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> Laws relating to Justice.
<br><a href="../douay/exo022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> The punishment of theft, and other trespasses. The law of lending without usury, of taking pledges of reverences to superiors, and of paying tithes.
<br><a href="../douay/exo023.htm"><strong>Chapter 23.</strong></a> Laws for judges; the rest of the seventh year, and day: three principal feasts to be solemnized every year; the promise of an angel, to conduct and protect them: idols are to be destroyed.
<br><a href="../douay/exo024.htm"><strong>Chapter 24.</strong></a> Moses writeth his law; and after offering sacrifices, sprinkleth the blood of the testament upon the people: then goeth up the mountain which God covereth with a fiery cloud.
<br><a href="../douay/exo025.htm"><strong>Chapter 25.</strong></a> Offerings prescribed for making the tabernacle, the ark, the candlestick, etc.
<br><a href="../douay/exo026.htm"><strong>Chapter 26.</strong></a> The form of the tabernacle with its appurtenances.
<br><a href="../douay/exo027.htm"><strong>Chapter 27.</strong></a> The altar; and the court of the tabernacle with its hangings and pillars. Provision of oil for lamps.
<br><a href="../douay/exo028.htm"><strong>Chapter 28.</strong></a> The holy vestments for Aaron and his sons.
<br><a href="../douay/exo029.htm"><strong>Chapter 29.</strong></a> The manner of consecrating Aaron and other priests; the institution of the daily sacrifice of two lambs, one in the morning, the other at evening.
<br><a href="../douay/exo030.htm"><strong>Chapter 30.</strong></a> The altar of incense: money to be gathered for the use of the tabernacle: the brazen laver: the holy oil of unction, and the composition of the perfume.
<br><a href="../douay/exo031.htm"><strong>Chapter 31.</strong></a> Beseleel and Ooliab are appointed by the Lord to make the tabernacle, and the things belonging thereto. The observation of the sabbath day is again commanded. And the Lord delivereth to Moses two tables written with the finger of God.
<br><a href="../douay/exo032.htm"><strong>Chapter 32.</strong></a> The people fall into idolatry. Moses prayeth for them. He breaketh the tables: destroyeth the idol: blameth Aaron, and causeth many of the idolaters to be slain.
<br><a href="../douay/exo033.htm"><strong>Chapter 33.</strong></a> The people mourn for their sin. Moses pitcheth the tabernacle without the camp. He converseth familiarly with God. Desireth to see his glory.
<br><a href="../douay/exo034.htm"><strong>Chapter 34.</strong></a> The tables are renewed: all society with the Chanaanites is forbid: some precepts concerning the firstborn, the sabbath, and other feasts: after forty days' fast, Moses returneth to the people with the commandments, and his face appearing horned with rays of light, he covereth it, whensoever he speaketh to the people.
<br><a href="../douay/exo035.htm"><strong>Chapter 35.</strong></a> The sabbath. Offerings for making the tabernacle. Beseleel and Ooliab are called to the work.

<br><a href="../douay/exo037.htm"><strong>Chapter 37.</strong></a> Beseleel maketh the ark: the propitiatory, and cherubims, the table, the candlestick, the lamps, and the altar of incense, and compoundeth the incense.
<br><a href="../douay/exo038.htm"><strong>Chapter 38.</strong></a> He maketh the altar of holocaust. The brazen laver. The court with its pillars and hangings. The sum of what the people offered.
<br><a href="../douay/exo039.htm"><strong>Chapter 39.</strong></a> All the ornaments of Aaron and his sons are made. And the whole work of the tabernacle is finished.
<br><a href="../douay/exo040.htm"><strong>Chapter 40.</strong></a> The tabernacle is commanded to be set up and anointed. God filleth it with his majesty.
