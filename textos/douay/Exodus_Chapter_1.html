<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>, <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a>, <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that came out of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> thigh, were seventy: but <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> was in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> In the mean time there arose a new <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king over Egypt</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to his people: Behold the people of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> are numerous and stronger than we.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens: and they built for <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of tabernacles...</strong> Or, of storehouses.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied and increased.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and afflicted them and mocked them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king of Egypt</a> spoke to the midwives of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a>: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> it: if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, keep it alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But the midwives feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and did not do as the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king of Egypt</a> had commanded, but saved the men children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a> called for them and said: What is it that you meant to do, that you would save the men children?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> They answered: The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not as the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: for they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And because the midwives feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he built them <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">houses</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Because the midwives feared God, etc...</strong> The midwives were rewarded, not for their <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, which was a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but for their fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their humanity: but this reward was only temporal, in building them houses, that is, in establishing and enriching their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive.</span></p>
