<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Go in to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>; for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants: that I may work these my <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> in him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And thou mayst tell in the ears of thy sons, and of thy grandsons, how often I have <a href="../cathen/12143a.htm">plagued</a> the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, and wrought my <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> amongst them: and you may know that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> went in to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and said to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a>: How long refusest thou to submit to me? let my people go, to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But if thou resist, and wilt not let them go, behold I will bring in to-morrow the locusts into thy coasts;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> To cover the face of the earth, that nothing thereof may appear, but that which the hail hath left may be eaten: for they shall feed upon all the trees that spring in the fields.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy servants, and of all the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>: such a number as thy fathers have not seen, nor thy grandfathers, from the time they were first upon the earth, until this present day. And he turned himself away, and went forth from <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> servants said to him: How long shall we endure this <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they called back <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>; and he said to them: Go, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>: who are they that shall go?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, with our sheep and herds: for it is the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> answered: So be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with you, as I shall let you and your children go: who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that you intend some great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> It shall not be so, but go ye men only, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for this yourselves also desired.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> unto the locust, that it come upon it, and devour every herb that is left after the hail.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> stretched forth his rod upon the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> brought a burning wind all that day, and night; and when it was morning, the burning wind raised the locusts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they came up over the whole land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and rested in all the coasts of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, innumerable, the like as had not been before that time, nor shall be hereafter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they covered the whole face of the earth, wasting all things. And the grass of the earth was devoured, and what fruits soever were on the trees, which the hail had left; and there remained not any thing that was green on the trees, or in the herbs of the earth, in all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> in haste called <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and said to them: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, and against you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But now forgive me my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> this time also, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, that he take away from me this death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> going forth from the presence of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he made a very strong wind to blow from the west, and it took the locusts and cast them into the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>: there remained not so much as one in all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hardened <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> heart, neither did he let the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> go.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Stretch out thy hand towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and may there be darkness upon the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> so thick that it may be felt. <span class="stiki"><strong>Darkness upon the land of Egypt, so thick that it may be felt...</strong> By means of the gross exhalations, which were to cause and accompany the darkness.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> saw his brother, nor moved himself out of the place where he was: but wheresoever the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> dwelt, there was light.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> called <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and said to them: Go, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: let your sheep only, and herds remain, let your children go with you.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> All the flocks shall go with us; there shall not a hoof remain of them: for they are necessary for the service of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>: especially as we know not what must be offered, till we come to the very place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hardened <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> heart, and he would not let them go.</span>
