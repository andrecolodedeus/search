<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> had sent out the people, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> led them not by the way of the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, which is near; thinking lest perhaps they would repent, if they should see wars arise against them, and would return into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But he led them about by the way of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, which is by the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> went up armed out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> took <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">bones</a> with him: because he had <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjured</a> the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall visit you, carry out my <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">bones</a> from hence with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And marching from Socoth, they encamped in Etham, in the utmost coasts of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> went before them to show the way, by day in a <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of a cloud</a>, and by night in a <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of fire</a>; that he might be the guide of their journey at both times.</span>
