<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Speak to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: Let them turn and encamp over against Phihahiroth, which is between Magdal and the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a> over against Beelsephon: you shall encamp before it upon the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> will say of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: They are straitened in the land, the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> hath shut them in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I shall harden his heart and he will pursue you: and I shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and in all his army: and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> shall know that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And it was told the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king of the Egyptians</a> that the people was fled: and the heart of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> and of his servants was changed with regard to the people, and they said: What meant we to do, that we let <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> go from serving us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So he made ready his chariot, and took all his people with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots that were in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the whole army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hardened the heart of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao, king of Egypt</a>, and he pursued the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>; but they were gone forth in a mighty hand.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Perhaps there were no <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">graves</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, therefore thou hast brought us to die in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: why wouldst thou do this, to lead us out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, saying: Depart from us, that we may serve the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>? for it was much better to serve them, than to die in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to the people: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">Fear</a> not: stand, and see the great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonders</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he will do this day; for the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, whom you see now, you shall see no more for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand over the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a>, and divide it: that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> may go through the midst of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a> on dry ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And I will harden the heart of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> to pursue you: and I will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and in all his host, and in his chariots and in his horsemen.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>, who went before the camp of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, removing, went behind them: and together with him the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of the cloud</a>, leaving the forepart,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had stretched forth his hand over the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> took it away by a strong and burning wind blowing all the night, and turned it into dry ground: and the water was divided.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> went in through the midst of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a> dried up; for the water was as a wall on their right hand and on their left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> pursuing went in after them, and all <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> horses, his chariots and horsemen, through the midst of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And now the morning watch was come, and behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> looking upon the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> army through the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of fire and of the cloud</a>, slew their host.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they were carried into the deep.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Stretch forth thy hand over the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a>, that the waters may come again upon the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, upon their chariots and horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had stretched forth his hand towards the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a>, it returned at the first break of day to the former place: and as the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> were fleeing away, the waters came upon them, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shut them up in the middle of the waves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, who had come into the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a> after them, neither did there so much as one of them remain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> marched through the midst of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a> upon dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand and on the left:</span>
