<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And she began the song to them, saying: Let us sing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for he is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> magnified, the horse and his rider he hath thrown into the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> brought <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, and they went forth into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Sur: and they marched three days through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and found no water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they came into Mara, and they could not drink the waters of Mara because they were bitter: whereupon he gave a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> also agreeable to the place, calling it Mara, that is, bitterness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the people murmured against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying: What shall we drink?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But he cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, they were turned into sweetness. There he appointed him ordinances, and judgments, and there he proved him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Saying: If thou wilt hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and do what is right before him, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> his commandments, and keep all his precepts, none of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that I laid upon <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, will I bring upon thee: for I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> thy healer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> came into Elim, where there were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped by the waters.</span></p>
