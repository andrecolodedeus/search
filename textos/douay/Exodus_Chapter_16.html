<div class="h1a">The people murmur for want of meat: God gives them quails and manna.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And they set forward from Elim, and all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> came into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Sin, which is between Elim and <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Sinai</a>: the fifteenth day of the second month, after they came out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And all the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> murmured against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> said to them: Would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we had died by the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when we sat over the fleshpots, and ate bread to the full: Why have you brought us into this <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, that you might destroy all the multitude with famine?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Behold I will rain <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">bread from heaven</a> for you; let the people go forth, and gather what is sufficient for every day: that I may prove them whether they will walk in my <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, or not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But the sixth day let them provide for to bring in: and let it be double to that they were wont to gather every day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> In the evening you shall know that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath brought you forth out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And in the morning you shall see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for he hath heard your murmuring against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: but as for us, what are we, that you mutter against us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: In the evening the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will give you flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full: for he hath heard your murmurings, with which you have murmured against him, for what are we? your murmuring is not against us, but against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: Say to the whole congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: Come before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; for he hath heard your murmuring.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> spoke to all the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, they looked towards the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>; and behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared in a cloud.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">spoke</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I have heard the murmuring of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, say to them: In the evening you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; and you shall know that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So it came to pass in the evening, that quails coming up, covered the camp: and in the morning a dew lay round about the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when it had covered the face of the earth, it appeared in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> small, and as it were beaten with a pestle, like unto the hoar frost on the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> saw it, they said one to another: Manhu! which signifieth: What is this! for they knew not what it was. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to them: This is the <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">bread</a> which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given you to eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> This is the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath commanded: Let every one gather of it as much as is enough to eat; a gomor for every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according to the number of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that dwell in a tent, so shall you take of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> did so: and they gathered, one more, another less.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they measured by the measure of a gomor: neither had he more that had gathered more; nor did he find less that had provided less: but every one had gathered, according to what they were able to eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to them: Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> leave thereof till the morning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they hearkened not to him, but some of them left until the morning, and it began to be full of worms, and it putrefied, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now every one of them gathered in the morning, as much as might suffice to eat: and after the sun grew hot, it melted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But on the sixth day they gathered twice as much, that is, two gomors every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and all the rulers of the multitude came, and told <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he said to them: This is what the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken: To morrow is the rest of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Whatsoever work is to be done, do it; and the meats that are to be dressed, dress them; and whatsoever shall remain, lay it up until the morning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they did so as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had commanded, and it did not putrefy, neither was there worm found in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: Eat it to day, because it is the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: to day it shall not be found in the field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Gather it six days; but on the seventh day is the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, therefore it shall not be found.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">seventh day</a> came; and some of the people going forth to gather, found none.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: How long will you refuse to keep my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, and my <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> See that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given you the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and for this reason on the sixth day he giveth you a double provision: let each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stay at home, and let none go forth out of his place the seventh day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the people kept the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> on the seventh day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">Manna</a>: and it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste thereof like to flour with honey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: This is the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word</a> which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath commanded: Fill a gomor of it, and let it be kept unto <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a> to come hereafter; that they may know the bread, wherewith I fed you in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> when you were brought forth out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: Take a vessel, and put <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> into it, as much as a gomor can hold; and lay it up before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to keep unto your <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> put it in the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> to be kept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> ate <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> forty years, till they came to a habitable land: with this meat were they fed, until they reached the borders of the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Now a gomor is the tenth part of an ephi.</span></p>
