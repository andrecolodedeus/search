<div class="h1a">Jethro brings to Moses his wife and children. His counsel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when Jethro the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, the kinsman of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, had heard all the things that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had done to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> his people, and that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had brought forth <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He took Sephora, the wife of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whom he had sent back:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And her two sons, of whom one was called Gersam: his father saying, I have been a stranger in a foreign country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the other Eliezer: For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my father, said he, is my helper, and hath delivered me from the sword of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Jethro, the kinsman of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, came with his sons, and his wife to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, where he was camped by the mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he sent word to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying: I Jethro, thy kinsman, come to thee, and thy wife, and thy two sons with her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he went out to meet his kinsman, and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">worshipped</a> and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him: and they saluted one another with words of peace. And when he was come into the tent,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> told his kinsman all that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had done to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> in favour of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and all the labour which had befallen them in the journey, and that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had delivered them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Jethro rejoiced for all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had done to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because he had delivered them out of the hands of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who hath delivered his people out of the hand of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now I know, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is great above all gods; because they dealt <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a> against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So Jethro, the kinsman of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> came, to eat bread with him before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the next day <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sat to judge the people, who stood by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from morning until night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when his kinsman had seen all things that he did among the people, he said: What is it that thou dost among the people? Why sittest thou alone, and all the people wait from morning till night?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> answered him: The people come to me to seek the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when any controversy falleth out among them, they come to me to judge between them, and to show the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">precepts of God</a>, and his laws.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But he said: The thing thou dost is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Thou art spent with foolish labour, both thou, and this people that is with thee; the business is above thy strength, thou alone canst not bear it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But hear my words and counsels, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be with thee. Be thou to the people in those things that pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to bring their words to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And to show the people the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and the manner of <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipping</a>; and the way wherein they ought to walk, and the work that they ought to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And provide out of all the people able <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, such as fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and appoint of them rulers of thousands, and of <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">hundreds</a>, and of fifties, and of tens,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Who may judge the people at all times: and when any great matter soever shall fall out, let them refer it to thee, and let them judge the lesser matters only: that so it may be lighter for thee, the burden being shared out unto others.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> If thou dost this, thou shalt fulfil the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shalt be able to bear his <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">precepts</a>: and all this people shall return to their places with peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> heard this, he did all things that he had suggested unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And choosing able <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> out of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, he appointed them rulers of the people, rulers over thousands, and over <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">hundreds</a>, and over fifties, and over tens.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they judged the people at all times: and whatsoever was of greater difficulty they referred to him, and they judged the easier cases only.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he let his kinsman depart: and he returned and went into his own country.</span></p>
