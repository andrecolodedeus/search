<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For departing out of Raphidim, and coming to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Sinai</a>, they camped in the same place, and there <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> pitched their tents over against the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mountain</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> went up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> called unto him from the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mountain</a>, and said: Thus shalt thou say to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Jacob</a>, and tell the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>And Moses went up to God...</strong> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> went up to <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount Sinai</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke to him.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> You have seen what I have done to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, how I have carried you upon the wings of eagles, and have taken you to myself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> If therefore you will hear my voice, and keep my covenant, you shall be my peculiar possession above all people: for all the earth is mine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And you shall be to me a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> kingdom, and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation. These are the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">words</a> thou shalt speak to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> came; and calling together the elders of the people, he declared all the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">words</a> which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And all the people answered together: All that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">spoken</a>, we will do. And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had related the people's words to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Lo, now will I come to thee in the darkness of a cloud, that the people may hear me speaking to thee, and may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> thee for ever. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> told the words of the people to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to him: Go to the people, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">sanctify</a> them today, and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And let them be ready against the third day; for on the third day the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will come down <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">in the sight</a> of all the people, upon <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people round about, and thou shalt say to them: Take heed ye go not up into the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, and that ye touch not the borders thereof: every one that toucheth the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, dying he shall die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> No hands shall touch him, but he shall be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a>, or he shall be shot through with arrows: whether it be beast, or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he shall not live. When the trumpet shall begin to sound, then let them go up into the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> came down from the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a> to the people, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> them. And when they had washed their garments,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He said to them: Be ready against the third day, and come not near your wives.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And now the third day was come, and the morning appeared: and behold thunders began to be heard, and lightning to flash, and a very thick cloud to cover the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, and the noise of the trumpet sounded exceeding loud; and the people that was in the camp, feared.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had brought them forth to meet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the place of the camp, they stood at the bottom of the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And all <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> was on a smoke: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was come down upon it in fire, and the smoke arose from it as out of a furnace: and all the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a> was terrible.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the sound of the trumpet grew by degrees louder and louder, and was drawn out to a greater length: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> answered him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> came down upon <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, in the very top of the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, and he called <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> unto the top thereof. And when he was gone up thither,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> He said unto him: Go down, and charge the people; lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and a very great multitude of them should perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also that come to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, let them be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>, lest he strike them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: The people cannot come up to <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>: for thou didst charge, and command, saying: Set limits about the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">sanctify</a> it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> with thee: but let not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the people pass the limits, nor come up to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, lest he kill them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> went down to the people and told them all.</span></p>
