<h1>Exodus Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Moses is born and exposed on the bank of the river; where he is taken up by the daughter of Pharao, and adopted for her son. He kills an Egyptian, and flees into Madian; where he marries a wife.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After this there went a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">house of Levi</a>; and took a wife of his own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And she conceived, and bore a <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">son</a>: and seeing him a goodly child, hid him three months.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">little babe</a> therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And behold the daughter of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river's brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> She opened it, and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it, she said: This is one of the babes of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the child's sister said to her: Shall I go, and call to thee a <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, to nurse the babe?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> daughter said to her: Take this child, and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> took and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And she adopted him for a son, and <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">called</a> him <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying: Because I took him out of the water. <span class="stiki"><strong>Moses...</strong> Or <em>Moyses</em>, in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> tongue, signifies one taken or saved out of the water.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> In those days, after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> striking one of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a>, his brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slew</a> the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and hid him in the sand. <span class="stiki"><strong>He slew the Egyptian...</strong> This he did by a particular inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as a prelude to his delivering the people from their <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">oppression and bondage</a>. He thought, says <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a>, <a href="../douay/act007.htm#verse25">Acts 7:25</a>, that his brethren understood that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his hand would save them. But such particular and extraordinary examples are not to be imitated.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And going out the next day, he saw two <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> quarrelling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us? wilt thou <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me, as thou didst yesterday <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>? <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feared</a>, and said: How is this come to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> heard of this word, and sought to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">kill</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, and he sat down by a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Madian...</strong> A city and country of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, which took its <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> from <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, by Cetura, and was peopled by his posterity.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the shepherds came and drove them away: and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual? <span class="stiki"><strong>Raguel...</strong> He had two <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>, being also called Jethro, as appears from the first verse of the following chapter.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> They answered: A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But he said: Where is he? why have you let the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> go? call him that he may eat bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my father, my helper, hath delivered me out of the hand of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Gersam...</strong> Or Gershom. This <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> signifies a stranger there: as Eliezer signifies the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now after a long time the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king of Egypt</a> died: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the works.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> looked upon the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Knew them...</strong> That is, he had respect to them, he cast a merciful eye upon them.</span></span></p>
