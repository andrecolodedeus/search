<div class="h1a">The people fall into idolatry. Moses prays for them. He breaks the tables: destroys the idol: blames Aaron, and causes many of the idolaters to be slain.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the people seeing that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> delayed to come down from the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, gathering together against <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, said: Arise, make us <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>, that may go before us: For as to this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that brought us out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, we know not what has befallen him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> said to them: Take the golden earrings from the ears of your wives, and your sons and daughters, and bring them to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the people did what he had commanded, bringing the earrings to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when he had received them, he fashioned them by founders' work, and made of them a <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">molten calf</a>. And they said: These are thy gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that have brought thee out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> saw this, he built an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> before it, and made proclamation by a crier's voice, saying To morrow is the solemnity of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And rising in the morning, they offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and peace victims, and the people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying: Go, get thee down: thy people, which thou hast brought out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, hath <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They have quickly strayed from the way which thou didst show them: and they have made to themselves a <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">molten calf</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> it, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> victims to it, have said: These are thy <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that have brought thee out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And again the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: I see that this people is stiffnecked:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Let me alone, that my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> may be kindled against them, and that I may destroy them, and I will make of thee a great nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> besought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: Why, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, is thy indignation enkindled against thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, with great power, and with a mighty hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Let not the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> say, I beseech thee: He craftily brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains, and destroy them from the earth: let thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> cease, and be appeased upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of thy people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Remember <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a>, thy servants, to whom thou <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworest</a> by thy own self, saying: I will multiply your seed as the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and this whole land that I have spoken of, I will give to your seed, and you shall possess it for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was appeased from doing the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which he had spoken against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">his people</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> returned from the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>, carrying the two tables of the testimony in his hand, written on both sides,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And made by the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the writing also of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was graven in the tables.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> hearing the noise of the people shouting, said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: The noise of battle is heard in the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But he answered: It is not the cry of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> encouraging to fight, nor the shout of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> compelling to flee: but I hear the voice of singers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">calf</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dances</a>: and being very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, he threw the tables out of his hand, and broke them at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And laying hold of the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">calf</a> which they had made, he burnt it, and beat it to powder, which he strewed into water, and gave thereof to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> to drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: What has this people done to thee, that thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he answered him: Let not my lord be offended; for thou knowest this people, that they are prone to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> They said to me: make us <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>, that may go before us; for as to this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who brought us forth out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, we know not what is befallen him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And I said to them: Which of you hath any gold? and they took and brought it to me; and I cast it into the fire, and this <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">calf</a> came out.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saw that the people were naked, (for <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> had stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth, and had set them naked among their enemies) <span class="stiki"><strong>Naked...</strong> Having lost not only their gold, and their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but what was worst of all, being stripped also of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having lost him. <strong>The shame of the filth...</strong> That is, of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a>, which they had taken for their god. It is the usual phrase of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> to call <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> filth and abominations.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then standing in the gate of the camp, he said: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be on the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> side, let him join with me. And all the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a> gathered themselves together unto him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he said to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Put every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his sword upon his thigh: go, and return from gate to gate through the midst of the camp, and let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> his brother, and friend, and neighbour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a> did according to the words of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and there were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a> that day about three and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: You have <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> your hands this day to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his son and in his brother, that a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> may be given to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when the next day was come, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke to the people: You have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> a very great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: I will go up to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, if by any means I may be able to entreat him for your crime.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And returning to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he said: I beseech thee: this people hath <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> a heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and they have made to themselves gods of gold: either forgive them this trespass,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Or if thou do not, strike me out of the book that thou hast written.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> answered him: He that hath <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against me, him will I strike out of my book:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But go thou, and lead this people whither I have told thee: my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> shall go before thee. And I in the day of revenge will visit this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also of theirs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> therefore struck the people for the guilt, on occasion of the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">calf</a> which <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> had made.</span></p>
