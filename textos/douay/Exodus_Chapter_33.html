<div class="h1a">The people mourn for their sin. Moses pitches the tabernacle outside the camp. He converses familiarly with God. Desires to see his glory.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying: Go, get thee up from this place, thou and thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, into the land concerning which I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, saying: To thy seed I will give it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I will send an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before thee, that I may cast out the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> That thou mayst enter into the land that floweth with milk and honey. For I will not go up with thee, because thou art a stiffnecked people; lest I destroy thee in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the people hearing these very bad tidings, mourned: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put on his ornaments according to custom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Say to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: Thou art a stiffnecked people, once I shall come up in the midst of thee, and shall destroy thee. Now presently lay aside thy ornaments, that I may know what to do to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> laid aside their ornaments by <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Horeb</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also taking the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, pitched it without the camp afar off, and called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof, The <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>. And all the people, that had any question, went forth to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>, without the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> went forth to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, all the people rose up, and every one stood in the door of his pavilion, and they beheld the back of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, till he went into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when he was gone into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of the cloud</a> came down, and stood at the door, and he spoke with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And all saw that the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of the cloud</a> stood at the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>. And they stood and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipped</a> at the doors of their tent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> face to face, as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is wont to speak to his friend. And when he returned into the camp, his servant <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua, the son of Nun</a>, a young man, departed not from the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Face to face...</strong> That is, in a most familiar manner. Though as we learn from this very chapter, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> could not see the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Thou commandest me to lead forth this people; and thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me, especially whereas thou hast said: I know thee by <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and thou hast found favour in my sight. <span class="stiki"><strong>I know thee by name...</strong> In the language of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to know such as he approves and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loves</a>: and to know by <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, those whom he favours in a most singular manner, as he did his servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> If therefore I have found favour in thy sight, show me thy face, that I may know thee, and may find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before thy eyes: look upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">thy people this nation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: My face shall go before thee, and I will give thee rest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: If thou thyself dost not go before, bring us not out of this place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For how shall we be able to know, I and thy people, that we have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in thy sight, unless thou walk with us, that we may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by all people that dwell upon the earth?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: This word also, which thou hast spoken, will I do; for thou hast found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before me, and thee I have known by <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said: Show me thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He answered: I will show thee all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and I will proclaim in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> before thee: and I will have mercy on whom I will, and I will be merciful to whom it shall please me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And again he said: Thou canst not <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">see my face</a>: for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall not <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">see me</a>, and live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And again he said: Behold there is a place with me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall pass, I will set thee in a hole of the rock, and protect thee with my righthand till I pass:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face thou canst not see. <span class="stiki"><strong>See my back parts...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> by his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, usually spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of the cloud</a>; so that he could not see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of him that spoke familiarly with him. In the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> here mentioned he was allowed to see something of him, in an assumed corporeal form: not in the face, the rays of which were too bright for mortal eye to bear, but to view him as it were behind, when his face was turned from him.</span></span></p>
