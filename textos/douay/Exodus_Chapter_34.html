<div class="h1a">The tables are renewed: all society with the Canaanites is forbid: some precepts concerning the firstborn, the sabbath, and other feasts: after forty days' fast, Moses returns to the people with the commandments, and his face appearing horned with rays of light, he covers it, whensoever he speaks to the people.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after this he said: Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the former, and I will write upon them the words, which were in the tables, which thou brokest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Be ready in the morning, that thou mayst forthwith go up into <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, and thou shalt stand with me upon the top of the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then he cut out two tables of stone, such as had been before; and rising very early he went up into the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him, carrying with him the tables.</span>
