<h1>Exodus Chapter 36</h1>
<div class="h1a">The offerings are delivered to the workmen, the curtains, coverings, boards, bars, veil, pillars, and hanging are made.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/02526d.htm">Beseleel</a> therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave wisdom and understanding, to know how to work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary, and which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had called them, and every skilful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had given wisdom, and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He delivered all the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> unto them. And while they were earnest about the work, the people daily in the morning offered their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: The people offereth more than is necessary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the crier's voice: Let neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> offer any more for the work of the sanctuary. And so they ceased from <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> gifts,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Because the things that were offered did suffice, and were too much.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were wise of heart, to accomplish the work of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, made ten curtains of twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidering</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four: all the curtains were of the same size.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled one to another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He made also loops of violet in the edge of one curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> That the loops might meet one against another, and might be joined each with the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold, that might catch the loops of the curtains, and they might be made one <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He made also eleven curtains of goats' hair, to cover the roof of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> One curtain was thirty cubits long, and four cubits broad: all the curtains were of one measure.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Five of which he joined apart, and the other six apart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together, that of all the curtains there might be made one covering.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He made also a cover for the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of rams' skins dyed red; and another cover over that of violet skins.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> He made also the boards of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a> standing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The length of one board was ten cubits; and the breadth was one cubit and a half.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other. And in this manner he made for all the boards of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Of which twenty were at the south side southward,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> At that side also of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, that looketh towards the north, he made twenty boards,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> With forty sockets of silver, two sockets for every board.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But against the west, to wit, at that side of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, which looketh to the sea, he made six boards,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And two others at each corner of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> behind:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Which were also joined from beneath unto the top, and went together into one joint. Thus he did on both sides at the corners:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> So there were in all eight boards, and they had sixteen sockets of silver, to wit, two sockets under every board.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> He made also bars of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, five to hold together the boards of one side of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And five others to join together the boards of the other side; and besides these, five other bars at the west side of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> towards the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> He made also another bar, that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the boards themselves he overlaid with gold casting for them sockets of silver. And their rings he made of gold, through which the bars might be drawn: and he covered the bars themselves with plates of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> He made also a veil of violet, and purple, scarlet and fine twisted linen, varied and distinguished with <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And four pillars of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, which with their heads he overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> He made also a hanging in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, with the work of an <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroiderer</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And five pillars with their heads, which he covered with gold, and their sockets he cast of brass.</span></p>
