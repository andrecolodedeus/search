<div class="h1a">Beseleel makes the ark: the propitiatory, and cherubims, the table, the candlestick, the lamps, and the altar of incense, and compounds the incense.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/02526d.htm">Beseleel</a> made also, the <a href="../cathen/01724a.htm">ark</a> of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>: it was two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he made to it a crown of gold round about,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he made bars of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, which he overlaid with gold,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> to carry it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Two <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> One <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> in the top of one side, and the other <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> in the top of the other side: two <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> at the two ends of the propitiatory,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He made also the table of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers breadth, and upon the same another golden crown.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The bars also themselves he made of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, and overlaid them with gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a> of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He made also the <a href="../cathen/13741b.htm">candlestick</a> of beaten work of the finest gold, from the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and three on the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies: and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches, that went out from the shaft of the <a href="../cathen/13741b.htm">candlestick</a> was equal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And bowls under two branches in three places, which together made six branches going out from one shaft.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same, all beaten work of the purest gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out, of the purest gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The <a href="../cathen/13741b.htm">candlestick</a> with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He made also the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two cubits: from the corners of which went out <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horns</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he overlaid it with the purest gold, with its grate, and the sides, and the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horns</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars might be put into them, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> be carried.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the bars themselves he made also of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, and overlaid them with plates of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> He compounded also the oil for the <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctification</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of the purest spices, according to the work of a perfumer.</span></p>
