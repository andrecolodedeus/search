<div class="h1a">He makes the altar of holocaust. The brazen laver. The court with its pillars and hangings. The sum of what the people offered.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> He made also the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ia">altar of holocaust</a> of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, five cubits square, and three in height:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horns</a> whereof went out from the corners, and he overlaid it with plates of brass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And for the uses thereof, he prepared divers vessels of brass, cauldrons, tongs, fleshhooks, pothooks and firepans.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he made the grate thereof of brass, in manner of a net, and under it in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> a hearth,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Casting four rings at the four ends of the net at the top, to put in bars to carry it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he made the bars of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">setim wood</a>, and overlaid them with plates of brass:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he drew them through the rings that stood out in the sides of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> itself was not solid, but hollow, of boards, and empty within.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He made also the laver of brass, with the foot thereof, of the mirrors of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that watched at the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He made also the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, in the south side whereof were hangings of fine twisted linen of a hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Twenty pillars of brass with their sockets, the beads of the pillars, and the whole graving of the work, of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> In like manner at the north side the hangings, the pillars, and the sockets and heads of the pillars were of the same measure, and work and <a href="../cathen/10218a.htm">metal</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But on that side that looketh to the west, there were hangings of fifty cubits, ten pillars of brass with their sockets, and the heads of the pillars, and all the graving of the work, of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Moreover, towards the east he prepared hangings of fifty cubits:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Fifteen cubits of which, were on one side with three pillars, and their sockets:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And on the other side (for between the two he made the entry of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>) there were hangings equally of fifteen cubits, and three pillars, and as many sockets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> All the hangings of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> were woven with twisted linen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The sockets of the pillars were of brass, and their heads with all their gravings of silver: and he overlaid the pillars of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> also with silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he made in the entry thereof an <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> hanging of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, that was twenty cubits long, and five cubits high, according to the measure of all the hangings of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the pillars in the entry were four, with sockets of brass, and their heads and gravings of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The pins also of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> round about he made of brass.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> These are the instruments of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>, which were counted according to the commandment of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, by the hand of Ithamar, son of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Which <a href="../cathen/02526d.htm">Beseleel</a>, the son of Uri, the son of Hur of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>, had made, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Having for his companion Ooliab, the son of Achisamech, of the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">tribe of Dan</a>: who also was an excellent artificer in wood, and worker in <a href="../cathen/14449b.htm">tapestry</a> and <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> in violet, purple, scarlet, and fine linen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> All the gold that was spent in the work of the sanctuary, and that was offered in gifts, was nine and twenty talents, and seven hundred and thirty sicles according to the standard of the sanctuary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And it was offered by them that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upwards, of six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> able to bear arms.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> There were moreover a hundred talents of silver, whereof were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and of the entry where the veil hangeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> A hundred sockets were made of a hundred talents, one talent being reckoned for every socket.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five he made the heads of the pillars, which also he overlaid with silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And there were offered of brass also seventy-two thousand talents, and four hundred sicles besides,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Of which were cast the sockets in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of brass with the grate thereof, and also the vessels that belong to the use thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the sockets of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> as well round about as in the entry thereof, and the pins of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> round about.</span></p>
