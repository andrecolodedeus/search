<div class="h1a">All the ornaments of Aaron and his sons are made. And the whole work of the tabernacle is finished.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he made, of violet and purple, scarlet and fine linen, the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> for <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> to wear when he ministered in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> So he made an <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> of gold, violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> With <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered work</a>, and he cut thin plates of gold, and drew them small into threads, that they might be twisted with the woof of the foresaid colours,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And two borders coupled one to the other in the top on either side,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And a girdle of the same colours, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He prepared also two onyx stones, fast set and closed in gold, and graven, by the art of a lapidary, with the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he set them in the sides of the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, for a memorial of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He made also a <a href="../cathen/11600b.htm">rational</a> with <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered work</a>, according to the work of the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Foursquare, double, of the measure of a span.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he set four rows of <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a> in it. In the first row was a sardius, a topaz, an emerald.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> In the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> In the third, a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> In the fourth, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl, set and enclosed in gold by their rows.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the twelve stones, were engraved with the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">twelve tribes of Israel</a>, each one with its several <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> They made also in the <a href="../cathen/11600b.htm">rational</a> little chains, linked one to another, of the purest gold,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And two hooks, and as many rings of gold. And they set the rings on either side of the <a href="../cathen/11600b.htm">rational</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> On which rings the two golden chains should hang, which they put into the hooks that stood out in the corners of the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> These both before and behind so answered one another, that the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11600b.htm">rational</a> were bound together,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Being fastened to the girdle, and strongly coupled with rings, which a violet fillet joined, lest they should flag loose, and be moved one from the other, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> They made also the <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> all of violet,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And a hole for the head in the upper part at the middle, and a woven border round about the hole:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And little bells of the purest gold, which they put between the pomegranates at the bottom of the <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunic</a> round about:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> To wit, a bell of gold, and a pomegranate, wherewith the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> went adorned, when he discharged his ministry, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> They made also fine linen <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunics</a> with woven work for <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitres</a> with their little crowns of fine linen:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And linen breeches of fine linen:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And a girdle of fine twisted linen, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, of <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery work</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> They made also the plate of sacred veneration of the purest gold, and they wrote on it with the engraving of a lapidary: The Holy of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they fastened it to the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> with a violet fillet, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So all the work of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> and of the roof of the testimony was finished: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> did all things which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they offered the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and the roof, and the whole furniture, the rings, the boards, the bars, the pillars and their sockets,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> The cover of rams' skins dyed red, and the other cover of violet skins,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> The veil, the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, the bars, the propitiatory,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> The table, with the vessels thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">loaves of proposition</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> The <a href="../cathen/13741b.htm">candlestick</a>, the lamps, and the furniture of them, with the oil:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> The <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of gold, and the <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of spices:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And the hanging in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> The <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of brass, the grate, the bars, and all the vessels thereof: the laver, with the foot thereof: the hangings of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and the pillars, with their sockets:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> The hanging in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and the little cords, and the pins thereof. Nothing was wanting of the vessels, that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and for the roof of the covenant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> The <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> also, which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to wit, <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons, use in the sanctuary,</span>
