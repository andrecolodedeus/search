<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent, so that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> fled from it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Put out thy hand, and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> That they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, saith he, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of their fathers, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, hath <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a> as snow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> If they will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">sign</a>, they will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the word of the latter <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">sign</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Speak to him, and put my <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">words</a> in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his month, and will show you what you must do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He shall speak in thy stead to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a>, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And take this rod in thy hand wherewith thou shalt do the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said to him; I will go and return to my brethren into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that I may see if they be yet alive.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass; and returned into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, carrying the rod of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him as he was returning into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: See that thou do all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonders</a> before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">people</a> go. <span class="stiki"><strong>I shall harden, etc...</strong> Not by being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm#e-c">efficient cause</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but by withdrawing from him, for his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment, the dew of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that might have softened his heart; and so suffering him to grow harder and harder.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is my son, my <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> met him, and would have killed him. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Lord met him, and would have killed him...</strong> This was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> representing the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who treated <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in this manner, for having neglected the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of his younger son; which his wife understanding, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> her child upon the spot, upon which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> let <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> go.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the foreskin of her son, and touched his feet, and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he let him go after she had said: A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: Go into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to meet <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> told <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> all the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">words</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, by which he had sent him, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> that he had commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the people <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.
