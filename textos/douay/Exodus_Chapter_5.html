<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> went in, and said to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Let my people go, that they may <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to me in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But he answered: Who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that I should hear his voice, and let <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> go? I know not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, neither will I let <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a> hath called us, to go three days' journey into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>; lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king of Egypt</a> said to them: Why do you <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> draw off the people from their works? Get you gone to your burdens.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> said: The people of the land are numerous; you see that the multitude is increased; how much more if you give them rest from their works?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works, and the task-masters of the people, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick, as before; but let them go and gather straw.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did before; neither shall you diminish any thing thereof, for they are idle, and therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Let them be oppressed with works, and let them fulfil them; that they may not regard <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters, went out and said to the people: Thus saith <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: I allow you no straw;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Go, and gather it where you can find it; neither shall any thing of your work be diminished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the people was scattered through all the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to gather straw.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying: Fulfil your work every day, as before ye were wont to do, when straw was given you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they that were over the works of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, were scourged by <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> taskmasters, saying: Why have you not made up the task of bricks, both yesterday and to day, as before?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the officers of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> came, and cried out to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, saying: Why dealest thou so with thy servants?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before; behold we, thy servants, are beaten with whips, and thy people is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> dealt withal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said: You are idle, and therefore you say: Let us go and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Go therefore and work: straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the accustomed number of bricks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the officers of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> saw that they were in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> case, because it was said to them: There shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they met <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, who stood over against them as they came out from <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they said to them: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> see and judge, because you have, made our savour to stink before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> and his servants, and you have given him a sword, to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> returned to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, why hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou sent me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For since the time that I went in to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> to speak in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, he hath afflicted thy people: and thou hast not delivered them.</span></p>
