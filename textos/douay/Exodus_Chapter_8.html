<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will strike all thy coasts with frogs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the river shall bring forth an abundance of frogs; which shall come up and enter into thy house, and thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the houses of thy servants, and to thy people, and into thy ovens, and into the remains of thy meats:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the frogs shall come in to thee, and to thy people, and to all thy servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Say to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: Stretch forth thy hand upon the streams, and upon the rivers and the <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pools</a>, and bring forth frogs upon the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> stretched forth his hand upon the waters of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the magicians also, by their <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">enchantments</a>, did in like manner, and they brought forth frogs upon the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> called <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and said to them: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> ye to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Pray ye to the Lord, etc...</strong> By this it appears, that though the magicians, by the help of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, could bring frogs, yet they could not take them away: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being pleased to abridge in this the power of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. So we see they could not afterwards produce the lesser insects; and in this restraint of the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, were forced to acknowledge the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: Set me a time when I shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs may be driven away from thee and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people; and may remain only in the river.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he answered: To morrow. But he said: I will do according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people; and shall remain only in the river.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> went forth from <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, which he had made to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> concerning the frogs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> did according to the word of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: and the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>, and out of the fields:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they gathered them together into immense heaps, and the land was corrupted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> seeing that rest was given, hardened his own heart, and did not hear them, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded. <span class="stiki"><strong>Pharao hardened his own heart...</strong> By this we see that <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> was himself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm#e-c">efficient cause</a> of his heart being hardened, and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. See the same repeated in <a href="../douay/gen008.htm#verse32">verse 32</a>. <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> hardened his heart at this time also: likewise <a href="../douay/gen009.htm#verse7">Genesis 9:7</a>, <a href="../douay/gen009.htm#verse35">9:35</a>, and <a href="../douay/gen013.htm#verse15">13:15</a>.</span></span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they did so.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the magicians with their <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">enchantments</a> practised in like manner, to bring forth sciniphs, and they could not: and there were sciniphs as well on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as on beasts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the magicians said to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: This is the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Arise early, and stand before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>; for he will go forth to the waters: and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Let my people go to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will send in upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy houses, all kind of flies: and the houses of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> shall be filled with flies of divers kinds, and the whole land wherein they shall be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And I will make the land of Gessen wonderful in that day, so that flies shall not be there: and thou shalt know that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in the midst of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And I will put a division between my people and thy people: tomorrow shall this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">sign</a> be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> did so.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> called <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and said to them: Go and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: It cannot be so: for we shall <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the abominations of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>: now if we kill those things which the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a>, in their presence, they will <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> us. <span class="stiki"><strong>The abominations, etc...</strong> That is, the things they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> for Gods: oxen, rams, etc. It is the usual style of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> to call all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols and false gods</a>, <em>abominations</em>, to signify how much the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">people of God</a> ought to detest and abhor them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> We will go three days' journey into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>; and we will <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, as he hath commanded us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> said: I will let you go to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, but go no farther: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me.</span>
