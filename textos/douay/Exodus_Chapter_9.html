<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But I know that neither thou, nor thy servants do yet fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And his heart was hardened, and the heart of his servants, and it was made exceeding hard: neither did he let the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> go, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></p>
