<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 1</h1>
<div class="h1a">The time of Ezekiel's prophecy: he sees a glorious vision.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captives</a> by the river Chobar, the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> were opened, and I saw the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The thirtieth year...</strong> Either of the age of Ezechiel; or, as others will have it, from the solemn covenant made in the eighteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>. <a href="../douay/2ki023.htm">2 Kings 23</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Ezechiel the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the son of Buzi in the land of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldeans</a>, by the river Chobar: and the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was there upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north: and a great cloud, and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it: and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures: and this was their appearance: there was the likeness of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Living creatures...</strong> <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubims</a> (as appears from <a href="../douay/sir049.htm#verse10">Sirach 49:10</a>) represented to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> under these mysterious shapes, as supporting the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as it were drawing his chariot. All this chapter appeared so obscure, and so full of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> to the ancient <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, that, as we learn from <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Ep. ad Paulin.), they suffered none to read it before they were thirty years old.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Every one had four faces, and every one four wings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they had the hands of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> under their wings on their four sides: and they had faces, and wings on the four sides,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another. They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> When they went, they went by their four parts: and they turned not when they went. <span class="stiki"><strong>When they went, they went by their four parts...</strong> That is, indifferently to any of their sides either forward or backward: to the right or to the left.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance: and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And, when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Whithersoever the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> went, thither as the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it: for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> was in the wheels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together, and followed them: for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> was in the wheels.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, the appearance of crystal terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And under the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most high God</a>: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For when a voice came from above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And above the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was the likeness of the appearance of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> above upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of fire within it round about: from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day: this was the appearance of the brightness round about.</span></p>
