<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 10</h1>
<div class="h1a">Fire is taken from the midst of the wheels under the cherubims, and scattered over the city. A description of the cherubims.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I saw and behold in the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> that was over the heads of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>, there appeared over them as it were the sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he spoke to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that was clothed with linen, and said: Go in between the wheels that are under the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> and fill thy hand with the coals of fire that are between the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>, and pour them out upon the city. And he went in, in my sight:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> stood on the right side of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went in, and a cloud filled the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was lifted up from above the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> to the threshold of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house</a> was filled with the cloud, and the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> was filled with the brightness of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the sound of the wings of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> was heard even to the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> as the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God Almighty</a> speaking.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when he had commanded the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was clothed with linen, saying: Take fire from the midst of the wheels that are between the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>: he went in and stood beside the wheel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And one <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> stretched out his arm from the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> to the fire that was between the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>: and he took, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And there appeared in the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> the likeness of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hand under their wings.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I saw, and behold there were four wheels by the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>: one wheel by one <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>, and another wheel by another <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>: and the appearance of the wheels was to the sight like the chrysolite stone:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And as to their appearance, all four were alike: as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when they went, they went by four ways: and they turned not when they went: but to the place whither they first turned, the rest also followed, and did not turn back. <span class="stiki"><strong>By four ways...</strong> That is, by any of the four ways, forward, backward, to the right or to the left.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And their whole body, and their necks, and their hands, and their wings, and the circles were full of eyes, round about the four wheels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And these wheels he called voluble, in my hearing. <span class="stiki"><strong>Voluble...</strong> That is, rolling wheels, <em>galgal</em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And every one had four faces: one face was the face of a <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>, and the second face, the face of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and in the third was the face of a lion: and in the fourth the face of an eagle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> were lifted up: this is the living creature that I had seen by the river Chobar.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> went, the wheels also went by them: and when the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> lifted up their wings, to mount up from the earth, the wheels stayed not behind, but were by them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> When they stood, these stood: and when they were lifted up, these were lifted up: for the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> was in them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> went forth from the threshold of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and stood over the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> lifting up their wings, were raised from the earth before me: and as they went out, the wheels also followed: and it stood in the entry of the east gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was over them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> This is the living creature, which I saw under the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by the river Chobar: and I understood that they were <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings: and the likeness of a man's hand was under their wings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And as to the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces which I had seen by the river Chobar, and their looks, and the impulse of every one to go straight forward.</span></p>
