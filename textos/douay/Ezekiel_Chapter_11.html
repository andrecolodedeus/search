<div class="h1a">A prophecy against the presumptuous assurance of the great ones. A remnant shall be saved, and receive a new spirit, and a new heart.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> lifted me up, and brought me into the east gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, which looketh towards the rising of the sun: and behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men: and I saw in the midst of them Jezonias the son of Azur, and Pheltias the son of <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a>, princes of the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, these are the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that study <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and frame a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> counsel in this city,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Saying: Were not houses lately built? This city is the caldron, and we the flesh. <span class="stiki"><strong>Were not houses lately built, etc...</strong> These <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> despised the predictions and threats of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; who declared to them from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the city should be destroyed, and the inhabitants carried into <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>: and they made use of this kind of argument against the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that the city, so far from being like to be destroyed, had lately been augmented by the building of new houses; from whence they further inferred, by way of a proverb, using the similitude of a cauldron, out of which the flesh is not taken, till it is thoroughly boiled, and fit to be eaten, that they should not be carried away out of their city, but there end their days in peace.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> against them, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>, thou <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a> fell upon me, and said to me: Speak: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Thus have you spoken, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the thoughts of your heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> You have <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> a great many in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Your slain, whom you have laid in the midst thereof, they are the flesh, and this is the caldron: and I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> You have <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feared</a> the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I will cast you out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hand of the enemies, and I will execute judgments upon you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> You shall fall by the sword: I will judge you in the borders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>In the borders of Israel...</strong> They pretended that they should die in peace in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tells them it should not be so; but that they should be judged and condemned, and fall by the sword in the borders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: viz., in Reblatha in the land of Emath, where all their chief men were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> (<a href="../douay/2ki025.htm">2 Kings 25</a>, and <a href="../douay/jer052.htm#verse10">Jeremias 52:10</a> and <a href="../douay/jer052.htm#verse27">52:27</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> This shall not be as a caldron to you, and you shall not be as flesh in the midst thereof: I will judge you in the borders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: because you have not walked in my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, and have not done my judgments, but you have done according to the judgments of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> that are round about you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And it came to pass, when I <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a>, that Pheltias the son of <a href="../cathen/02246a.htm">Banaias</a> died: and I fell down upon my face, and I cried with a loud voice: and said: Alas, alas, alas, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: wilt thou make an end of all the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, thy brethren, thy brethren, thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsmen</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, all they to whom the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> have said: Get ye far from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the land is given in possession to us. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thy brethren, etc...</strong> He speaks of them that had been carried away <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captives</a> before; who were <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> by them that remained in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: but as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> here declares to them from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should be in a more <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> condition than they, and after some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> return from their <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Because I have removed them far off among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and because I have <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a> them among the countries: I will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Therefore speak to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: I will gather you from among the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries wherein you are <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a>, and I will give you the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they shall go in thither, and shall take away all the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> thereof from thence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> That they may walk in my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, and keep my judgments, and do them: and that they may be my people, and I may be their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But as for them whose heart walketh after their <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a>, I will lay their way upon their head, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> lifted up their wings, and the wheels with them: and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was over them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> went up from the midst of the city, and stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> lifted me up, and brought me into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldea</a>, to them of the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> which I had seen was taken up from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And I spoke to them of the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a> all the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he had shown me.</span></p>
