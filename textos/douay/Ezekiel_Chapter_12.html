<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thou, therefore, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, prepare thee all necessaries for removing, and remove by day into their sight: and thou shalt remove out of thy place to another place in their sight, if so be they will regard it: for they are a provoking house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And thou shalt bring forth thy furniture as the furniture of one that is removing by day in their sight: and thou shalt go forth in the evening in their presence, as one goeth forth that removeth his dwelling.</span>
