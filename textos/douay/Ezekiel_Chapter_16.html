<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt say: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, thy father was an <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and thy mother a Cethite.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, nor swaddled with clouts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee: but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the day that thou wast born.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood: and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood: Live: I have said to thee: Live in thy blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field: and thou didst increase and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> ornament: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: and thou was naked, and full of confusion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I passed by thee, and saw thee: and behold thy time was the time of lovers: and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy ignominy. And I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to thee, and I entered into a covenant with thee, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: and thou becamest mine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from thee: and I anointed thee with oil.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I clothed thee with <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, and shod thee with violet coloured shoes: and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed thee with fine garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain about thy neck. <span class="stiki"><strong>I decked thee also with ornaments, etc...</strong> That is, with <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> benefits, giving you a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">rites</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And thou wast adorned with gold, and silver, and wast clothed with fine linen, and <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered work</a>, and many colours: thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceeding beautiful: and wast advanced to be a queen.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And thy renown went forth among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> for thy beauty: for thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be his.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed together on each side: and hast played the harlot upon them, as hath not been done before, nor shall be hereafter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels, of my gold, and my silver, which I gave thee, and thou madest thee images of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and hast committed fornication with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours, and coveredst them: and settest my oil and my sweet <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And my bread which I gave thee, the fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast set before them for a sweet odour; and it was done, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And thou hast taken thy sons, and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me: and hast <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> the same to them to be devoured. Is thy fornication small?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Thou hast <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> and given my children to them, consecrating them by fire. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thou hast sacrificed, etc...</strong> As there is nothing more base and abominable than the crimes mentioned throughout this chapter; so the infidelities of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> in forsaking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> even their children to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, are strongly figured by these allegories.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And after all thy abominations, and fornications, thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked, and full of confusion, trodden under foot in thy own blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And it came to pass after all thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> (woe, woe to thee, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> That thou didst also build thee a common stew, and madest thee a brothel house in every street.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution: and hast made thy beauty to be abominable: and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and hast multiplied thy fornications.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And thou hast committed fornication with the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> thy neighbours, men of large bodies, and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will take away thy justification: and I will deliver thee up to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the daughters of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thee, that are ashamed of thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Thou hast also committed fornication with the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, because thou wast not yet satisfied: and after thou hadst played the harlot with them, even so thou wast not contented.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldeans</a>: and neither so wast thou satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart, saith <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: seeing thou dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every way, and thou hast made thy high place in every street: and wast not as a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But is an adulteress, that bringeth in strangers over her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Gifts are given to all harlots: but thou hast given hire to all thy lovers, and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every side, to commit fornication with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in thy fornications, and after thee there shall be no such fornication, for in that thou gavest rewards, and didst not take rewards, the contrary hath been done in thee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Therefore, O harlot, hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Because thy money hath been poured out, and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and with the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of thy abominations, by the blood of thy children whom thou gavest them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Behold, I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all whom thou hast <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>, with all whom thou hast <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>: and I will gather them together against thee on every side, and will discover thy shame in their sight, and they shall see all thy nakedness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And I will judge thee as adulteresses, and they that shed blood are judged: and I will give thee blood in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall destroy thy brothel house, and throw down thy stews: and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty: and leave thee naked, and full of disgrace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they shall bring upon thee a multitude, and they shall <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> thee with stones, and shall <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slay</a> thee with their swords.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and shall execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: and thou shalt cease from fornication, and shalt give no hire any more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And my indignation shall rest in thee: and my <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a> shall depart from thee, and I will cease and be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> no more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these things: wherefore I also have turned all thy ways upon thy head, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and I have not done according to thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">wicked deeds</a> in all thy abominations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Behold every one that useth a common proverb, shall use this against thee, saying: As the mother was, so also is her daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Thou art thy mother's daughter, that cast off her husband, and her children: and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who cast off their husbands, and their children: your mother was a Cethite, and your father an <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And thy elder sister is <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and her daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> But neither hast thou walked in their ways, nor hast thou done a little less than they according to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickednesses</a>: thou hast done almost more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things than they in all thy ways.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> As I live, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, thy sister <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> herself, and her daughters, have not done as thou hast done, and thy daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Behold this was the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> thy sister, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, fulness of bread, and abundance, and the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">idleness</a> of her, and of her daughters: and they did not put forth their hand to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>, and the poor. <span class="stiki"><strong>This was the iniquity of Sodom, etc...</strong> That is, these were the steps by which the <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodomites</a> came to fall into those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> for which they were destroyed.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And they were lifted up, and committed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> before me: and I took them away as thou hast seen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> committed not half thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but thou hast surpassed them with thy crimes, and hast justified thy sisters by all thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> which thou hast done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion, thou that hast surpassed thy sisters with thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, doing more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a> than they: for they are justified above thee, therefore be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, thou that hast justified thy sisters.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, with her daughters, and by bringing back <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and her daughters: and I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them. <span class="stiki"><strong>I will bring back, etc...</strong> This relates to the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> out of all nations, and of many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of Christ</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> That thou mayest bear thy shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, comforting them.</span>
