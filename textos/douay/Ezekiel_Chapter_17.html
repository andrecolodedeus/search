<div class="h1a">The parable of the two eagles and the vine. A promise of the cedar of Christ and his Church.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, put forth a riddle, and speak a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And say: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>; A large eagle with great wings, long-limbed, full of feathers, and of variety, came to <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a>, and took away the marrow of the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>A large eagle...</strong> <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon</a>. -- Ibid. <strong>Came to Libanus...</strong> That is, to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. -- Ibid. <strong>Took away the marrow of the cedar...</strong> King Jechonias.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He cropped off the top of the twigs thereof: and carried it away into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and he set it in a city of merchants. <span class="stiki"><strong>Chanaan...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, which signifies traffic, is not taken here for Palestine, but for Chaldea: and the city of merchants here mentioned is <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he took of the seed of the land, and put it in the ground for seed, that it might take a firm root over many waters: he planted it on the surface of the earth. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of the seed of the land, etc...</strong> Viz., Sedecias, whom he made king.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature, and the branches thereof looked towards him: and the roots thereof were under him. So it became a vine, and grew into branches, and shot forth sprigs. <span class="stiki"><strong>Towards him...</strong> <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, to whom Sedecias <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> allegiance.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And there was another large eagle, with great wings, and many feathers: and behold this vine, bending as it were her roots towards him, stretched forth her branches to him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation. <span class="stiki"><strong>Another large eagle...</strong> Viz., the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> It was planted in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ground upon many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, that it might become a large vine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Say thou: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Shall it prosper then? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and strip off its fruit, and dry up all the branches it hath shot forth, and make it wither: and this without a strong arm, or many people to pluck it up by the root?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Behold, it is planted: shall it prosper then? shall it not be dried up when the burning wind shall touch it, and shall it not wither in the furrows where it grew?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Say to the provoking house: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not what these things mean? Tell them: Behold the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> cometh to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and he shall take away the king and the princes thereof and carry them with him to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Shall take away...</strong> Or, hath taken away, etc., for all this was now done.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he shall take one of the king's seed, and make a covenant with him, and take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of him. Yea, and he shall take away the mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the land,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up, but keep his covenant and observe it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that it might give him horses, and much people. And shall he that hath done thus prosper, or be saved? and shall he escape that hath broken the covenant?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> As I live, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: In the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> he hath made void, and whose covenant he broke, even in the midst of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> shall he die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And not with a great army, nor with much people shall <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> fight against him: when he shall cast up mounts, and build forts, to cut off many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For he had <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, breaking his covenant, and behold he hath given his hand: and having done all these things, he shall not escape.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: As I live, I will lay upon his head the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> he hath <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>, and the covenant he hath broken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and will judge him there for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">transgression</a> by which he hath <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword: and the residue shall be scattered into every wind: and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> have spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: I myself will take of the marrow of the high <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>, and will set it: I will crop off a tender twig from the top of the branches thereof, and I will plant it on a mountain high and eminent. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of the marrow of the high cedar, etc...</strong> Of the royal stock of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. Ibid. <strong>A tender twig...</strong> Viz., <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath planted in mount Sion, that is, the high mountain of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, to which all nations flow.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> On the high mountains of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> will I plant it, and it shall shoot forth into branches and shall bear fruit, and it shall become a great <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>: and all birds shall dwell under it, and every fowl shall make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And all the trees of the country shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree: and have dried up the green tree, and have caused the dry tree to flourish. I the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> have spoken and have done it.</span></p>
