<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And say:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions, and bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions? <span class="stiki"><strong>Thy mother the lioness...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And she brought out one of her whelps, and he became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>One of her whelps...</strong> Viz., Joachaz, alias Sellum.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> heard of him, and took him, but not without receiving wounds: and they brought him in chains into the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But she seeing herself weakened, and that her <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> was lost, took one of her young lions, and set him up for a lion. <span class="stiki"><strong>One of her young lions...</strong> Joakim.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he went up and down among the lions, and became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He learned to make <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and to lay waste their cities: and the land became desolate, and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> came together against him on every side out of the provinces, and they spread their net over him, in their wounds he was taken.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they put him into a cage, they brought him in chains to the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>: and they cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water: her fruit and her branches have grown out of many waters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And she hath strong rods to make sceptres for them that bear rule, and her stature was exalted among the branches: and she saw her height in the multitude of her branches.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But she was plucked up in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and cast on the ground, and the burning wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods are withered, and dried up: the fire hath devoured her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And now she is transplanted into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, in a land not passable, and dry.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And a fire is gone out from a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit: so that she now hath no strong rod, to be a sceptre of rulers. This is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.</span></blockquote>
