<div class="h1a">God refuses to answer the ancients of Israel inquiring by the prophet: but by him sets his benefits before their eyes, and their heinous sins: threatening yet greater punishments: but still mixed with mercy.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month: there came <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to inquire of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and they sat before me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, speak to the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Are you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not answer you, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> If thou judgest them, if thou judgest, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, declare to them the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> of their fathers. <span class="stiki"><strong>If thou judgest them...</strong> Or, if thou wilt enter into the cause and plead against them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: In the day when I chose <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and lifted up my hand for the race of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Jacob</a>: and appeared to them in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and lifted up my hand for them, saying: I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> In that day I lifted up my hand for them to bring them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, into a land which I had provided for them, flowing with milk and honey, which excelleth amongst all lands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I said to them: Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cast away the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Scandals, etc...</strong> <em>Offensiones</em>. That is, the abominations or <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, to the worship of which they were allured by their eyes.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But they provoked me, and would not hearken to me: they did not every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cast away the abominations of his eyes, neither did they forsake the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and I said I would pour out my indignation upon them, and accomplish my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against them in the midst of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But I did otherwise for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake, that it might not be violated before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, in the midst of whom they were, and among whom I made myself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them, to bring them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore I brought them out from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and brought them into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I gave them my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">statutes</a>, and I showed them my judgments, which if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> do, he shall live in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Moreover I gave them also my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, to be a sign between me and them: and that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that sanctify them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> provoked me in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my judgments, which if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> do he shall live in them: and they grievously violated my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>. I said therefore that I would pour out my indignation upon them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and would consume them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But I spared them for the sake of my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, lest it should be profaned before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, from which I brought them out, in their sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So I lifted up my hand over them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, not to bring them into the land which I had given them flowing with milk and honey, the best of all lands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Because they cast off my judgments, and walked not in my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">statutes</a>, and violated my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>: for their heart went after <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Yet my eye spared them, so that I destroyed them not: neither did I consume them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I said to their children in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: Walk not in the statutes of your fathers, and observe not their judgments, nor be ye defiled with their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>: walk ye in my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">statutes</a>, and observe my judgments, and do them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And sanctify my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, that they may be a sign between me and you: and that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But their children provoked me, they walked not in my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, nor observed my judgments to do them: which if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> do, he shall live in them: and they violated my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>: and I threatened to pour out my indignation upon them, and to accomplish my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But I turned away my hand, and wrought for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake, that it might not be violated before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, out of which I brought them forth in their sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Again I lifted up my hand upon them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, to disperse them among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scatter</a> them through the countries:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Because they had not done my judgments, and had cast off my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">statutes</a>, and had violated my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and their eyes had been after the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of their fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Therefore I also gave them statutes that were not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and judgments, in which they shall not live. <span class="stiki"><strong>Statutes that were not good, etc...</strong> Viz., the laws and ordinances of their enemies; or those imposes upon them by that cruel tyrant the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to whose power they were delivered up for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And I polluted them in their own <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">gifts</a>, when they offered <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">all that opened the womb</a>, for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">offences</a>: and they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>I polluted them, etc...</strong> That is, I gave them up to such blindness in punishment of their offences, as to pollute themselves with the blood of all their <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, whom they offered up to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in compliance with their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> devices.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Wherefore speak to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, and say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Moreover in this also your fathers <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> me, when they had <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> and contemned me;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And I had brought them into the land, for which I lifted up my hand to give it them: they saw every high hill, and every shady tree, and there they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> their victims: and there they presented the provocation of their <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, and there they set their sweet odours, and poured forth their libations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And I said to them: What meaneth the high place to which you go? and the name thereof was called High-place even to this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Wherefore say to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Verily, you are defiled in the way of your fathers, and you commit fornication with their abominations.</span>
