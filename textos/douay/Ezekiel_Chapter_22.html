<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt show her all her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a>, and shalt say: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: This is the city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come: and that hath made <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> against herself, to defile herself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Thou art become guilty in thy blood which thou hast shed: and thou art defiled in thy <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> which thou hast made: and thou hast made thy days to draw near, and hast brought on the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and a mockery to all countries.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Behold the princes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, every one hath employed his arm in thee to shed blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They have abused father and mother in thee, they have oppressed the stranger in the midst of thee, they have grieved the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">fatherless</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thou hast <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> my sanctuaries, and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">profaned</a> my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They have taken gifts in thee to shed blood: thou hast taken <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> and increase, and hast <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetously</a> oppressed thy neighbours: and thou hast forgotten me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Behold, I have clapped my hands at thy <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which thou hast exercised: and at the blood that hath been shed in the midst of thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Shall thy heart endure, or shall thy hands prevail in the days which I will bring upon thee: I the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> have spoken, and will do it.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Because you are all turned into dross, therefore behold I will gather you together in the midst of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> As they gather silver, and brass, and tin, and iron, and lead in the midst of the furnace: that I may kindle a fire in it to melt it: so will I gather you together in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a> and in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and will take my rest, and I will melt you down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And will gather you together, and will burn you in the fire of my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and you shall be melted in the midst thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you be in the midst thereof: and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, when I have poured out my indignation upon you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> There is a conspiracy of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the midst thereof: like a lion that roareth and catcheth the prey, they have devoured <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, they have taken <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> and hire, they have made many <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> in the midst thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Her <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> my <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law</a>, and have defiled my sanctuaries: they have put no difference between <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">profane</a>: nor have distinguished between the polluted and the clean: and they have turned away their eyes from my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and I was <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">profaned</a> in the midst of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Her princes in the midst of her, are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood, and to destroy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and to run after gains through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And her <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have daubed them without tempering the mortar, seeing vain things, and <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divining</a> <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lies</a> unto them, saying: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath not spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> The people of the land have used oppression, and committed <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>: they afflicted the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy and poor</a>, and they oppressed the stranger by <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> without judgment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And I sought among them for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that might set up a hedge, and stand in the gap before me in favour of the land, that I might not destroy it: and I found none.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And I poured out my indignation upon them, in the fire of my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> I consumed them: I have rendered their way upon their own head, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span></p>
