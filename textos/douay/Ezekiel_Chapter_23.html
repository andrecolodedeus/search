<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they committed fornication in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in their youth they committed fornication: there were their breasts pressed down, and the teats of their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> were bruised. <span class="stiki"><strong>Committed fornication...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</span></span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Moreover also she did not forsake her fornications which she had committed in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: for they also lay with her in her youth, and they bruised the breasts of her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and poured out their fornication upon her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the sons of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, upon whose <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> she doted.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They discovered her disgrace, took away her sons and daughters, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slew</a> her with the sword: and they became <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and they executed judgments in her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when her sister Ooliba saw this, she was mad with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> more than she: and she carried her fornication beyond the fornication of her sister.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I saw that she was defiled, and that they both took one way.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And she increased her fornications: and when she had seen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> painted on the wall, the images of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldeans</a> set forth in colours,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And girded with girdles about their reins, and with dyed turbans on their heads, the resemblance of all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, the likeness of the sons of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and of the land of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldeans</a> wherein they were born,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> She doted upon them with the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of her eyes, and she sent messengers to them into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Chaldea</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when the sons of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> were come to her to the bed of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, they defiled her with their fornications, and she was polluted by them, and her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was glutted with them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And she discovered her fornications, and discovered her disgrace: and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was alienated from her, as my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was alienated from her sister.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For she multiplied her fornications, remembering the days of her youth, in which she played the harlot in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And she was mad with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after lying with them whose flesh is as the flesh of asses: and whose issue as the issue of horses.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And thou hast renewed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of thy youth, when thy breasts were pressed in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the paps of thy <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> broken.</span></blockquote>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And I will set my <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a> against thee, which they shall execute upon thee with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a>: they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears: and what remains shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons, and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by fire.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> They have done these things to thee, because thou hast played the harlot with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> among which thou wast defiled with their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister and I will give her cup into thy hand.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Thou shalt be filled with <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and sorrow: with the cup of grief and sadness, with the cup of thy sister <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And thou shalt drink it, and shalt drink it up even to the dregs, and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof, thou shalt rend thy breasts: because I have spoken it, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Because thou hast forgotten me, and hast cast me off behind thy back, bear thou also thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and thy fornications.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to me, saying:</p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Because they have committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and blood is in their hands, and they have committed fornication with their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: moreover also their children, whom they bore to me, they have <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offered</a> to them to be devoured.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Yea, and they have done this to me. They polluted my <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">sanctuary</a> on the same day, and profaned my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And when they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> their children to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and went into my <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">sanctuary</a> the same day to profane it: they did these things even in the midst of my house.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> They sent for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> coming from afar, to whom they had sent a messenger: and behold they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, and didst paint thy eyes, and wast adorned with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> ornaments.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Thou sattest on a very fine bed, and a table was decked before thee: whereupon thou didst set my <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and my <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing: and to some that were brought of the multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and that came from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.</span><br />
