<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 24</h1>
<div class="h1a">Under the parable of a boiling pot is shown the utter destruction of Jerusalem: for which the Jews at Babylon shall not dare to mourn.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, write thee the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of this day, on which the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> hath set himself against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt speak by a figure a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to the provoking house, and say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Set on a pot, set it on, I say, and put water in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Heap together into it the pieces thereof, every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> piece, the thigh and the shoulder, choice pieces and full of bones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Take the fattest of the flock, and lay together piles of bones under it: the seething thereof is boiling hot, and the bones thereof are thoroughly sodden in the midst of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose rust is in it, and its rust is not gone out of it: cast it out piece by piece, there hath no lot fallen upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For her blood is in the midst of her, she hath shed it upon the smooth rock: she hath not shed it upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And that I might bring my indignation upon her, and take my vengeance: I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock, that it should not be covered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Woe to the bloody city, of which I will make a great bonfire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Heap together the bones, which I will burn with fire: the flesh shall be consumed, and the whole composition shall be sodden, and the bones shall be consumed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted: and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof, and let the rust of it be consumed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, not even by fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thy <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness: neither shalt thou be cleansed, before I <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> my indignation to rest in thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> have spoken: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not pass by, nor spare, nor be pacified: I will <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judge</a> thee according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, behold I take from thee the desire of thy eyes with a stroke, and thou shall not lament, nor weep; neither shall thy tears run down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead: let the tire of thy head be upon thee, and thy shoes on thy feet, and cover not thy face, nor eat the meat of mourners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening: and I did in the morning as he had commanded me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the people said to me: Why dost thou not tell us what these things mean that thou doest?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I said to them: The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Speak to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Behold I will <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">profane</a> my <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">sanctuary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of your realm, and the thing that your eyes desire, and for which your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feareth</a>: your sons, and your daughters, whom you have left, shall fall by the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your faces, nor shall you eat the meat of mourners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> You shall have crowns on your heads, and shoes on your feet: you shall not lament nor weep, but you shall pine away for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, and every one shall sigh with his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a> shall be unto you for a sign of things to come: according to all that he hath done, so shall you do, when this shall come to pass: and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And thou, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, behold in the day wherein I will take away from them their strength, and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the desire of their eyes, upon which their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> rest, their sons and their daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee, to tell thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> In that day, I say, shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and shalt be silent no more: and thou shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come, and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
