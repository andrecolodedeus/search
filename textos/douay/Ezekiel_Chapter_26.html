<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the first day of the month, that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> hath said of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: Aha, the gates of the people are broken, she is turned to me: I shall be filled, now she is laid waste.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Behold I come against thee, O <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and I will cause many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> to come up to thee, as the waves of the sea rise up.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they shall break down the walls of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and destroy the towers thereof: and I will scrape her dust from her, and make her like a smooth rock.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> She shall be a drying place for nets in the midst of the sea, because I have spoken it, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: and she shall be a spoil to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Her daughters also that are in the field, shall be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a> by the sword: and they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Behold I will bring against <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon</a>, the king of kings, from the north, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and companies, and much people.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thy daughters that are in the field, he shall <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> with the sword: and he shall compass thee with forts, and shall cast up a mount round about: and he shall lift up the buckler against thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he shall set engines of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and battering rams against thy walls, and shall destroy thy towers with his arms.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> By reason of the multitude of his horses, their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, when they shall go in at thy gates, as by the entrance of a city that is destroyed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets, thy people he shall <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> with the sword, and thy famous <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">statues</a> shall fall to the ground.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They shall waste thy <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, they shall make a spoil of thy merchandise: and they shall destroy thy walls, and pull down thy fine houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber, and thy dust in the midst of the waters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I will make the multitude of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall be heard no more.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I will make thee like a naked rock, thou shalt be a drying place for nets, neither shalt thou be built any more: for I have spoken it, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>: Shall not the islands shake at the sound of thy fall, and the groans of thy slain when they shall be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> in the midst of thee?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones: and take off their robes, and cast away their broidered garments, and be clothed with astonishment: they shall sit on the ground, and with amazement shall wonder at thy sudden fall.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And taking up a lamentation over thee, they shall say to thee: How art thou fallen, that dwellest in the sea, renowned city that wast strong in the sea, with thy inhabitants whom all did dread?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Now shall the ships be astonished in the day of thy terror: and the islands in the sea shall be troubled because no one cometh out of thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: When I shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited: and shall bring the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">deep</a> upon thee, and many waters shall cover thee:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when I shall bring thee down with those that descend into the pit to the everlasting people, and shall set thee in the lowest parts of the earth, as places desolate of old, with them that are brought down into the pit, that thou be not inhabited: and when I shall give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the land of the living,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I will bring thee to nothing, and thou shalt not be, and if thou be sought for, thou shalt not be found any more for ever, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span></blockquote>
