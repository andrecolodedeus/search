<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 3</h1>
<div class="h1a">The prophet eats the book, and receives further instructions: the office of a watchman.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, eat all that thou shalt find: eat this book, and go speak to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel...</strong> By this eating of the book was signified the diligent attention and affection with which we are to receive, and embrace the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a>; and to let it, as it were, sink into our interior by devout meditation.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that book:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with this book, which I give thee, and I did eat it: and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, go to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and thou shalt speak my words to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech, and of an unknown tongue, but to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not understand: and if thou wert sent to them, they would hearken to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> will not hearken to thee: because they will not hearken to me: for all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> are of a hard forehead and an obstinate heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces: and thy forehead harder than their foreheads.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint: fear them not, neither be thou dismayed at their presence: for they are a provoking house.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And go get thee in to them of the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: If so be they will hear, and will forbear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion, saying: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, from his place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one against another, and the noise of the wheels following the living creatures, and the noise of a great commotion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> also lifted me, and took me up: and I went away in bitterness in the indignation of my <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>: for the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with me, strengthening me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I came to them of the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat: and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them. <span class="stiki"><strong>The heap of new corn...</strong> It was the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of a place: in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, <em>tel abib</em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And at the end of seven days the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, I have made thee a watchman to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> If, when I say to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, Thou shalt surely die: thou declare it not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> way, and live: the same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall die in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, but I will require his blood at thy hand.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Moreover if the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall turn away from his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and shall commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>: I will lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning: he shall die in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justices</a> which he hath done, shall not be remembered: but I will require his blood at thy hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But if thou warn the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> may not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and he doth not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and thou hast delivered thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was upon me, and he said to me: Rise and go forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And I rose up, and went forth into the plain: and behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> stood there, like the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I saw by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Go in; and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And thou, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, behold they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them: and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that reproveth: because they are a provoking house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: He that heareth, let him hear: and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a provoking house.</span></p>
