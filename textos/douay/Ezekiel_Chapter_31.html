<div class="h1a">The Assyrian empire fell for their pride: the Egyptian shall fall in like manner.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the third month the first day of the month, that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem">
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, speak to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and to his people: To whom art thou like in thy greatness?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Behold, the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> was like a <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a> in <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a>, with fair branches, and full of leaves, of a high stature, and his top was elevated among the thick boughs.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The waters nourished him, the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">deep</a> set him up on high, the streams thereof ran round about his roots, and it sent forth its rivulets to all the trees of the country.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the country and his branches were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated because of many waters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when he had spread forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air made their nests in his boughs, and all the beasts of the forest brought forth their young under his branches, and the assembly of many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> dwelt under his shadow.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he was most beautiful for his greatness, and for the spreading of his branches: for his root was near great waters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise of God</a> were not higher than he, the fir trees did not equal his top, neither were the plane trees to be compared with him for branches: no tree in the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise of God</a> was like him in his beauty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For I made him beautiful and thick set with many branches: and all the trees of pleasure, that were in the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envied</a> him.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Because he was exalted in height, and shot up his top green and thick, and his heart was lifted up in his height:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, he shall deal with him: I have cast him out according to his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>I have delivered...</strong> Here the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> past is put for the future, i.e., I shall deliver. -- Ibid. <strong>The mighty one, etc...</strong> Viz., <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, who conquered both the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And strangers, and the most cruel of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> shall cut him down, and cast him away upon the mountains, and his boughs shall fall in every valley, and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the country: and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow, and leave him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins, and all the beasts of the field were among his branches.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height: nor shoot up their tops among the thick branches and leaves, neither shall any of them that are watered stand up in their height: for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, with them that go down into the pit.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: In the day when he went down to hell, I brought in mourning, I covered him with the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">deep</a>: and I withheld its rivers, and restrained the many waters: <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a> grieved for him, and all the trees of the field trembled.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I shook the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> with the sound of his fall, when I brought him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of pleasure, the choice and best in <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a>, all that were moistened with waters, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a> by the sword; and the arm of every one shall sit down under his shadow in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> To whom art thou like, O thou that art famous and lofty among the trees of pleasure? Behold, thou art brought down with the trees of pleasure to the lowest parts of the earth: thou shalt sleep in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">uncircumcised</a>, with them that are <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a> by the sword: this is <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and all his multitude, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span></blockquote>
