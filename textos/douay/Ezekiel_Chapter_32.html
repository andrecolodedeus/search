<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, take up a lamentation for <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and say to him: Thou art like the lion of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and the dragon that is in the sea: and thou didst push with the horn in thy rivers, and didst trouble the waters with thy feet, and didst trample upon their streams.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Therefore, thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: I will spread out my net over thee with the multitude of many people, and I will draw thee up in my net.</span><br />
