<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them: When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, one of their meanest, and make him a watchman over them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he sees the sword coming upon the land, and sound the trumpet, and tell the people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet, whosoever he be, and doth not look to himself, if the sword come, and cut him off: his blood shall be upon his own head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not look to himself, his blood shall be upon him: but if he look to himself, he shall save his <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And if the watchman see the sword coming, and sound not the trumpet: and the people look not to themselves, and the sword come, and cut off a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from among them: he indeed is taken away in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So thou, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, I have made thee a watchman to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>: therefore thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> When I say to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, thou shalt surely die: if thou dost not speak to warn the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from his way: that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall die in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, but I will require his blood at thy hand.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Say to them: As I live, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, I desire not the death of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> turn from his way, and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways: and why will you die, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>?</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And if I shall say to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: Thou shalt surely die: and he do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and do judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> None of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which he hath committed, shall be imputed to him: he hath done judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he shall surely live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the children of thy people have said: The way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">equitable</a>: whereas their own way is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And you say: The way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is not right, I will <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judge</a> every one of you according to his ways, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that there came to me one that was fled from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying: The city is laid waste.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had been upon me in the evening, before he that was fled came: and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning, and my mouth being opened, I was silent no more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, they that dwell in these ruinous places in the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, speak, saying: <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was one, and he inherited the land, but we are many, the land is given us in possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Therefore say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: You that eat with the blood and lift up your eyes to your <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleannesses</a>, and that shed blood: shall you possess the land by inheritance?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> You stood on your swords, you have committed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a>, and every one hath defiled his neighbours wife; and shall you possess the land by inheritance?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Say thou thus to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: As I live, they that dwell in the ruinous places, shall fall by the sword: and he that is in the field, shall be given to the beasts to be devoured: and they that are in holds, and caves, shall die of the pestilence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And I will make the land a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> strength thereof shall fail, and the mountains of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be desolate, because there is none to pass by them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, when I shall have made their land waste and desolate, for all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> which they have committed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And thou <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>: the children of thy people, that talk of thee by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his neighbour, saying: Come, and let us hear what is the word that cometh forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And they come to thee, as if people were coming in, and my people sit before thee: and hear thy words, and do them not: for they turn them into a song of their mouth, and their heart goeth after their <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And thou art to them as a musical song which is sung with a sweet and agreeable voice: and they hear thy words, and do them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And when that which was foretold shall come to pass, for behold it is coming, then shall they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> hath been among them.</span></p>
