<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was upon me, and brought me forth in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a>: and set me down in the midst of a plain that was full of bones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he led me about through them on every side: now they were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were exceeding dry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, dost thou think these bones shall live? And I answered: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">Prophesy</a> concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> to these bones: Behold, I will send <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> into you, and you shall live. <span class="stiki"><strong>Spirit...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, and breath.</span></span>
