<div class="h1a">A prophetic description of the siege of Jerusalem, and the famine that shall reign there.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And thou, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee: and draw upon it the plan of the city of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And lay siege against it, and build forts, and cast up a mount, and set a camp against it, and place battering rams round about it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And take unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face resolutely against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: it is a sign to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and shalt lay the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> upon it, according to the number of the days that thou shalt sleep upon it, and thou shalt take upon thee their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I have laid upon thee the years of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days: and thou shalt bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when thou hast accomplished this, thou shalt sleep again upon thy right side, and thou shalt take upon thee the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a> forty days: a day for a year, yea, a day for a year I have appointed to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and thy arm shall be stretched out: and thou shalt <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> against it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Behold I have encompassed thee with bands: and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And take to thee wheat and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And thy meat that thou shalt eat, shall be in weight twenty staters a day: from time to time thou shalt eat it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time thou shalt drink it, <span class="stiki"><strong>Hin...</strong> That is, a measure of liquids containing about ten pints.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And thou shalt eat it as barley bread baked under the ashes: and thou shalt cover it, in their sight, with the dung that cometh out of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: So shall the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> eat their bread all filthy among the nations whither I will cast them out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, behold my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath not been defiled, and from my infancy even till now, I have not eaten any thing that died of itself, or was torn by beasts, and no <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> flesh hath entered into my mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to me: Behold I have given thee neat's dung for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> dung, and thou shalt make thy bread therewith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>: Behold, I will break in pieces the staff of bread in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care: and they shall drink water by measure, and in distress.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So that when bread and water fail, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may fall against his brother, and they may pine away in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>.</span></p>
