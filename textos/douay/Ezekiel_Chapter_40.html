<div class="h1a">The prophet sees in a vision the rebuilding of the temple: the dimensions of several parts thereof.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the five and twentieth year of our <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">captivity</a>, in the beginning of the year, the tenth day of the month, the fourteenth year after the city was destroyed: in the selfsame day the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was upon me, and he brought me thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> In the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he brought me into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and set me upon a very high mountain: upon which there was as the building of a city, bending towards the south.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he brought me in thither, and behold a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed in his hand, and he stood in the gate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee: for thou art brought hither that they may be shown to thee: declare all that thou seest, to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a handbreadth: and he measured the breadth of the building one reed, and the height one reed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he came to the gate that looked toward the east, and he went up the steps thereof: and he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate one reed, that is, one threshold was one reed broad;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad: and between the little chambers were five cubits:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the threshold of the gate by the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of the gate within, was one reed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he measured the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of the gate eight cubits, and the front thereof two cubits: and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of the gate was inward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the little chambers of the gate that looked eastward were three on this side, and three on that side: all three were of one measure, and the fronts of one measure, on both parts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate ten cubits: and the length of the gate thirteen cubits:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the border before the little chambers one cubit: and one cubit was the border on both sides: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side and that side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he measured the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another, in breadth five and twenty cubits: door against door.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He made also fronts of sixty cubits: and to the front the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the gate on every side round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And before the face of the gate which reached even to the face of the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of the inner gate, fifty cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And slanting windows in the little chambers, and in their fronts, which were within the gate on every side round about: and in like manner there were also in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a> windows round about within, and before the fronts the representation of palm trees.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he brought me into the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and behold there were chambers, and a pavement of stone in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> round about: thirty chambers encompassed the pavement. <span class="stiki"><strong>There were chambers...</strong> Gazophylacia, so called, because the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> kept in them the stores and vessels that belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the pavement in the front of the gates according to the length of the gates was lower.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he measured the breadth from the face of the lower gate to the front of the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> without, a hundred cubits to the east, and to the north.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> He measured also both the length and the breadth of the gate of the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, which looked northward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the little chambers thereof three on this side, and three on that side: and the front thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof according to the measure of the former gate, fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the windows thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a>, and the gravings according to the measure of the gate that looked to the east, and they went up to it by seven steps, and a <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> was before it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the gate of the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> was over against the gate of the north, and that of the east: and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he brought me out to the way of the south, and behold the gate that looked to the south: and he measured the front thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof according to the former measures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the windows thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a> round about, as the other windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And there were seven steps to go up to it: and a <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> before the doors thereof: and there were graven palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side in the front thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And there was a gate of the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> towards the south: and he measured from gate to gate towards the south, a hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he brought me into the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> at the south gate: and he measured the gate according to the former measures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof with the same measures: and the windows thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof round about it was fifty cubits in length, and five and twenty cubits in breadth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> round about was five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof to the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and the palm trees thereof in the front: and there were eight steps to go up to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he brought me into the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> by the way of the east: and he measured the gate according to the former measures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof as before: and the windows thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a> thereof round about it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof, that is, of the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>: and the graven palm trees in the front thereof on this side and on that side: and the going up thereof was by eight steps.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he brought me into the gate that looked to the north: and he measured according to the former measures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof, and the windows thereof round about it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> thereof looked to the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>: and the graving of palm trees in the front thereof was on this side and on that side: and the going up to it was by eight steps.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And at every chamber was a door in the forefronts of the gates: there they washed the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side: that the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">trespass</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> might be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a> thereon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And on the outward side, which goeth up to the entry of the gate that looketh toward the north, were two tables: and at the other side before the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of the gate were two tables.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side: at the sides of the gate were eight tables, upon which they slew the victims.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And the four tables for the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> were made of square stones: one cubit and a half long, and one cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high: to lay the vessels upon, in which the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> and the victim is slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And the borders of them were of one handbreadth, turned inwards round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, which was on the side of the gate that looketh to the north: and their prospect was towards the south, one at the side of the east gate, which looketh toward the north.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And he said to me: This chamber, which looketh toward the south shall be for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that watch in the wards of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> But the chamber that looketh towards the north shall be for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that watch over the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>. These are the sons of Sadoc, who among the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a>, come near to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to minister to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And he measured the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad foursquare: and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> that was before the face of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
