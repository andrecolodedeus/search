<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 41</h1>
<div class="h1a">A description of the temple, and of all the parts of it.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he brought me into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and he measured the fronts six cubits broad on this side, and six cubits on that side, the breadth of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The temple...</strong> This plan of a <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, which was here shown to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, partly had relation to the material <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, which was to be rebuilt: and partly, in a <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> sense, to the spiritual <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of Christ</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the breadth of the gate was ten cubits: and the sides of the gate five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and he measured the length thereof forty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then going inward he measured the front of the gate two cubits: and the gate six cubits, and the breadth of the gate seven cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he measured the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, before the face of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and he said to me: This is the holy of holies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he measured the wall of the house six cubits: and the breadth of every side chamber four cubits round about the house on every side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the side chambers one by another, were twice thirty-three: and they bore outwards, that they might enter in through the wall of the house in the sides round about, to hold in, and not to touch the wall of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>One by another...</strong> Or one over another; literally, side to side, or side upon side.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And there was a broad passage round about, going up by winding stairs, and it led into the upper loft of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> all round: therefore was the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> broader in the higher parts: and so from the lower parts they went to the higher by the midst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I saw in the house the height round about, the foundations of the side chambers which were the measure of a reed the space of six cubits:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the thickness of the wall for the side chamber without, which was five cubits: and the inner house was within the side chambers of the house, <span class="stiki"><strong>And the inner house was within the side chambers of the house...</strong> Because these side chambers were in the very walls of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> all round. Or, it may also be rendered (more agreeably to the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>) so as to signify that the thickness of the wall for the side chamber within, was the same as that of the wall without; that is, equally five cubits.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And between the chambers was the breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the door of the side chambers was turned towards the place of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: one door was toward the north, and another door was toward the south: and the breadth of the place for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, was five cubits round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the building that was separate, and turned to the way that looked toward the sea, was seventy cubits broad: and the wall of the building, five cubits thick round about: and ninety cubits long.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he measured the length of the house, a hundred cubits: and the separate building, and the walls thereof, a hundred cubits in length.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the breadth before the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he measured the length of the building over against it, which was separated at the back of it: and the galleries on both sides a hundred cubits: and the inner <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The thresholds, and the oblique windows, and the galleries round about on three sides, over against the threshold of every one, and floored with wood all round about: and the ground was up to the windows, and the windows were shut over the doors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And even to the inner house, and without all the wall round about within and without, by measure.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And there were <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> and palm trees wrought, so that a palm tree was between a <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a> had two faces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The face of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion was toward the palm tree on the other side: set forth through all the house round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> From the ground even to the upper parts of the gate, were <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> and palm trees wrought in the wall of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The threshold was foursquare, and the face of the sanctuary, sight to sight. <span class="stiki"><strong>The threshold was foursquare...</strong> That is, the gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was foursquare: and so placed as to answer the gate of the sanctuary within.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of wood was three cubits high: and the length thereof was two cubits: and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof were of wood. And he said to me: This is the table before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And there were two doors in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and in the sanctuary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And in the two doors on both sides were two little doors, which were folded within each other: for there were two wickets on both sides of the doors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And there were <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> also wrought in the doors of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, and the figures of palm trees, like as were made on the walls: for which cause also the planks were thicker in the front of the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> without.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Upon which were the oblique windows, and the representation of palm trees on this side, and on that side in the sides of the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a>, according to the sides of the house, and the breadth of the walls.</span></p>
