<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 42</h1>
<div class="h1a">A description of the courts, chambers, and other places belonging to the temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he brought me forth into the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> by the way that leadeth to the north, and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate building, and over against the house toward the north.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> In the face of the north door was the length of a hundred cubits, and the breadth of fifty cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Over against the twenty cubits of the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and over against the pavement of the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> that was paved with stone, where there was a gallery joined to a triple gallery.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And before the chambers was a walk ten cubits broad, looking to the inner parts of a way of one cubit. And their doors were toward the north,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> where were the store chambers lower above: because they bore up the galleries, which appeared above out of them from the lower parts, and from the midst of the building.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For they were of three stories, and had not pillars, as the pillars of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a>: therefore did they appear above out of the lower places, and out of the middle places, fifty cubits from the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the outward wall that went about by the chambers, which were towards the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> on the forepart of the chambers, was fifty cubits long.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For the length of the chambers of the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> was fifty cubits: and the length before the face of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, a hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And there was under these chambers, an entrance from the east, for them that went into them out of the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> In the breadth of the outward wall of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> that was toward the east, over against the separate building, and there were chambers before the building.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the way before them was like the chambers which were toward the north: they were as long as they, and as broad as they: and all the going in to them, and their fashions, and their doors were alike.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> According to the doors of the chambers that were towards the south: there was a door in the head of the way, which way was before the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a>, separated towards the east as one entereth in.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he said to me: The chambers of the north, and the chambers of the south, which are before the separate building: they are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chambers, in which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> shall eat, that approach to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> into the holy of holies: there they shall lay the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, and the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and for trespass: for it is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> shall have entered in, they shall not go out of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places into the outward <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>: but there they shall lay their <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, wherein they minister, for they are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: and they shall put on other garments, and so they shall go forth to the people.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate that looked toward the east: and he measured it on every side round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he measured toward the east with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he measured toward the north five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And towards the south he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And toward the west he measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> By the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side round about, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, making a separation between the sanctuary and the place of the people.</span></p>
