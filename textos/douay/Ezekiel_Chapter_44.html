<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he brought me back to the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary, which looked towards the east: and it was shut.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall pass through it: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath entered in by it, and it shall be shut</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For the prince.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he brought me by the way of the north gate, in the sight of the house: and I saw, and behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> filled the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and I fell on my face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, attend with thy heart, and behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, all that I say to thee concerning all the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and concerning all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> thereof: and mark well the ways of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, with all the goings out of the sanctuary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And thou shalt say to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> that provoketh me: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Let all your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doings suffice you, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> In that you have brought in strangers uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, and to defile my house: and you <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offer</a> my bread, the fat, and the blood: and you have broken my covenant by all your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And you have not kept the ordinances of my sanctuary: but you have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they shall not come near to me, to do the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to me, neither shall they come near to any of my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things that are by the holy of holies: but they shall bear their shame, and their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickednesses</a> which they have committed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I will make them doorkeepers of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.</span></p>
