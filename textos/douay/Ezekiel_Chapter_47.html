<div class="h1a">The vision of the holy waters issuing out from under the temple. The borders of the land to be divided among the twelve tribes.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he brought me again to the gate of the house, and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house toward the east: for the forefront of the house looked toward the east: but the waters came down to the right side of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> to the south part of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Waters...</strong> These waters are not to be understood literally (for there were none such that flowed from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>); but <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: the trees that grow on the banks are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: the fishes are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that spiritually live in and by these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> waters, the fishermen are the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolic</a> preachers: the fenny places, where there is no health, are such as by being out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> are separated from these waters of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he led me out by the way of the north gate, and he <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> me to turn to the way without the outward gate to the way that looked toward the east: and behold there ran out waters on the right side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that had the line in his hand went out towards the east, he measured a thousand cubits: and he brought me through the water up to the ankles.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And again he measured a thousand, and he brought me through the water up to the knees.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he measured a thousand, and he brought me through the water up to the loins. And he measured a thousand, and it was a torrent, which I could not pass over: for the waters were risen so as to make a deep torrent, which could not be passed over.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>. And he brought me out, and he <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> me to turn to the bank of the torrent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when I had turned myself, behold on the bank of the torrent were very many trees on both sides.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he said to me: These waters that issue forth toward the hillocks of sand to the east, and go down to the plains of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, shall go into the sea, and shall go out, and the waters shall be healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And every <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> creature that creepeth whithersoever the torrent shall come, shall live: and there shall be fishes in abundance after these waters shall come thither, and they shall be healed, and all things shall live to which the torrent shall come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the fishers shall stand over these waters, from <a href="../cathen/05428a.htm">Engaddi</a> even to Engallim there shall be drying of nets: there shall be many sorts of the fishes thereof, as the fishes of the great sea, a very great multitude:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But on the shore thereof, and in the fenny places they shall not be healed, because they shall be turned into saltpits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And by the torrent on the banks thereof on both sides shall grow all trees that bear fruit: their leaf shall not fall off, and their fruit shall not fail: every month shall they bring forth <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a>, because the waters thereof shall issue out of the sanctuary: and the fruits thereof shall be for food, and the leaves thereof for medicine.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: This is the border, by which you shall possess the land according to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">twelve tribes of Israel</a>: for <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> hath a double portion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And you shall possess it, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in like manner as his brother: concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for a possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And this is the border of the land: toward the north side, from the great sea by the way of Hethalon, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> go to Sedada,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Emath, Berotha, Sabarim, which is between the border of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> and the border of Emath the house of Tichon, which is by the border of Auran.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the border from the sea even to the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of Enan, shall be the border of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and from the north to the north: the border of Emath, this is the north side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the east side is from the midst of Auran, and from the midst of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and from the midst of Galaad, and from the midst of the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> making the bound to the east sea, and thus you shall measure the east side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the south side southward is from Thamar even to the waters of contradiction of <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>: and the torrent even to the great sea: and this is the south side southward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the side toward the sea, is the great sea from the borders straight on, till thou come to Emath: this is the side of the sea.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And you shall divide this land unto you by the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that shall come over to you, that shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the same country born among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: they shall divide the possession with you in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And in what <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> soever the stranger shall be, there shall you give him possession, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>.</span></p>
