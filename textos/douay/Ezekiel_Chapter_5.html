<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> A third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city, according to the fulfilling of the days of the siege: and thou shalt take a third part, and cut it in pieces with the knife all round about: and the other third part thou shalt scatter in the wind, and I will draw out the sword after them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt take thereof a small number: and shalt bind them in the skirt of thy cloak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And thou shalt take of them again, and shalt cast them in the midst of the fire, and shalt burn them with fire: and out of it shall come forth a fire into all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> have spoken it: When I shall send upon them the grievous arrows of famine, which shall bring death, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will gather together famine against you: and I will break among you the staff of bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And I will send in upon you famine, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beasts unto utter destruction: and pestilence, and blood shall pass through thee, and I will bring in the sword upon thee.
