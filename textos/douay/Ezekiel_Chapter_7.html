<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And thou <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> to the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: The end is come, the end is come upon the four quarters of the land.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now is an end come upon thee, and I will send my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon thee, and I will <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judge</a> thee according to thy ways: and I will set all thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> against thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And my eye shall not spare thee, and I will show thee no pity: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: One affliction, behold an affliction is come.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> An end is come, the end is come, it hath awaked against thee: behold it is come.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Destruction is come upon thee that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of slaughter is near, and not of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of mountains.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now very shortly I will pour out my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon thee, and I will accomplish my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy crimes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And my eye shall not spare, neither will I show mercy: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that strike.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">Iniquity</a> is risen up into a rod of impiety: nothing of them shall remain, nor of their people, nor of the noise of them: and there shall be no rest among them.</span><br />

For the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> which regardeth all the multitude thereof, shall not go back: neither shall <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be strengthened in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of his life.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Blow the trumpet, let all be made ready, yet there is none to go to the battle: for my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> shall be upon all the people thereof.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The sword without: and the pestilence, and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword: and they that are in the city, shall be devoured by the pestilence, and the famine.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And such of them as shall flee shall escape: and they shall be in the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them trembling, every one for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> All hands shall be made feeble, and all knees shall run with water.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Their silver shall be cast forth, and their gold shall become a dunghill. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. They shall not satisfy their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and their bellies shall not be filled: because it hath been the stumbling block of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they have turned the ornament of their <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">jewels</a> into <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and have made of it the images of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: therefore I have made it an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> to them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And I will give it into the hands of strangers for spoil, and to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of the earth for a prey, and they shall defile it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall violate my secret place: and robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. <span class="stiki"><strong>Secret place, etc...</strong> Viz., the inward sanctuary, the holy of holies.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Make a shutting up: for the land is full of the judgment of blood, and the city is full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Make a shutting up...</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, a chain, viz., for imprisonment and captivity.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And I will bring the worst of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and they shall possess their houses: and I will make the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the mighty to cease, and they shall possess their <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">sanctuary</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> When distress cometh upon them, they will seek for peace and there shall be none.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Trouble shall come upon trouble, and rumour upon rumour, and they shall seek a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> shall perish from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and counsel from the ancients.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with sorrow, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled.
