<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> sat before me, that the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> fell there upon me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I saw, and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins, and downward, fire: and from his loins, and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the appearance of amber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the likeness of a hand was put forth and took me by a lock of my head: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> lifted me up between the earth and the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and brought me in the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, near the inner gate, that looked toward the north, where was set the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a> to provoke to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was there, according to the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> which I had seen in the plain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, lift up thy eyes towards the way of the north, and I lifted up my eyes towards the way of the north: and behold on the north side of the gate of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a> in the very entry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, dost thou see, thinkest thou, what these are doing, the great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> committeth here, that I should depart far off from my sanctuary? and turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he brought me in to the door of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>: and I saw, and behold a hole in the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he said to me: <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, dig in the wall. And when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to me: Go in, and see the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> which they commit here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I went in and saw, and behold every form of creeping things, and of living creatures, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, were painted on the wall all round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and Jezonias the son of Saaphan stood in the midst of them, that stood before the pictures: and every one had a <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> in his hand: and a cloud of smoke went up from the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said to me: Surely thou seest, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, what the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> do in the dark, every one in private in his chamber: for they say: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> seeth us not, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath forsaken the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he said to me: If thou turn thee again, thou shalt see greater abominations which these commit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he brought me in by the door of the gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Lord's house</a>, which looked to the north: and behold <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> sat there mourning for Adonis. <span class="stiki"><strong>Adonis...</strong> The favourite of Venus, slain by a wild boar, as feigned by the heathen poets, and which being here represented by an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a>, is lamented by the female worshippers of that goddess. In the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is Tammuz.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>: but turn thee again, and thou shalt see greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> than these.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he brought me into the inner <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and behold at the door of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, between the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, were about five and twenty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> having their backs towards the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and their faces to the east: and they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> towards the rising of the sun.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>: is this a light thing to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a>, that they should commit these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">abominations</a> which they have committed here: because they have filled the land with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and have turned to provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>? and behold they put a branch to their nose.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore I also will deal with them in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: my eye shall not spare them, neither will I show mercy: and when they shall cry to my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.</span></p>
