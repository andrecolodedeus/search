<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 9</h1>
<div class="h1a">All are ordered to be destroyed that are not marked in their foreheads. God will not be entreated for them.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city are at hand, and every one hath a destroying weapon in his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And behold six <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> came from the way of the upper gate, which looketh to the north: and each one had his weapon of destruction in his hand: and there was one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the midst of them clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn at his reins: and they went in, and stood by the brazen <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went up from the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub</a>, upon which he was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man that was clothed with linen, and had a writer's inkhorn at his loins.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and mark Thau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and mourn for all the abominations that are committed in the midst thereof. <span class="stiki"><strong>Mark Thau...</strong> Thau, or Tau, is the last letter in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> alphabet, and signifies a sign, or a mark; which is the reason why some translators render this place set a mark, or mark a mark without specifying what this mark was. But <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, and other interpreters, conclude it was the form of the letter Thau, which in the ancient <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> character, was the form of a <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And to the others he said in my hearing: Go ye after him through the city, and strike: let not your eyes spare, nor be ye moved with pity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Utterly destroy old and young, maidens, children and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: but upon whomsoever you shall see Thau, kill him not, and begin ye at my sanctuary. So they began at the ancient men who were before the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to them: Defile the house, and fill the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a> with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slew</a> them that were in the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the slaughter being ended I was left; and I fell upon my face, and crying, I said: Alas, alas, alas, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, by pouring out thy fury upon <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to me: The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, is exceeding great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perverseness: for they have said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath forsaken the earth, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> seeth not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore neither shall my eye spare, nor will I have pity: I will requite their way upon their head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And behold the man that was clothed with linen, that had the inkhorn at his back, returned the word, saying: I have done as thou hast commanded me.</span></p>
