<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a> might be fulfilled, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians: and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and in writing also, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> hath given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him a house in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Who is there among you of all his people? His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be with him. Let him go up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and build the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: he is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And let all the rest in all places wheresoever they dwell, help him every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from his place, with silver and gold, and goods, and cattle, besides that which they offer freely to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then rose up the chief of the fathers of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and every one whose spirit <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had raised up, to go up to build the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, which was in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And all they that were round about, helped their hands with vessels of silver, and gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with furniture, besides what they had offered on their own accord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And king Cyrus brought forth vessels of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> had taken from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and had put them in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of his god.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithridates the son of Gazabar, and numbered them to Sassabasar the prince of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And this is the number of them: thirty bowls of gold, a thousand bowls of silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty cups of gold,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Silver cups of a second sort, four hundred and ten: other vessels a thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> All the vessels of gold and silver, five thousand four hundred: all these Sassabasar brought with them that came up from the captivity of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
