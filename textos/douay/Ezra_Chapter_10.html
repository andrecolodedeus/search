<div class="h1a">Order is given for discharging strange women: the names of the guilty.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> was thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and beseeching, and weeping, and lying before the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, there was gathered to him of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> an exceeding great assembly of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, and the people wept with much lamentation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Sechenias the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam answered, and said to <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a>: We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: and now if there be repentance in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> concerning this,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Let us make a covenant with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the will of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and of them that fear the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>: let it be done according to the law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Arise, it is thy part to give orders, and we will be with thee: take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and do it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> arose, and made the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> that they would do according to this word, and they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> rose up from before the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, and went to the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliasib, and entered in thither: he ate no bread, and drank no water: for he mourned for the transgression of them that were come out of the captivity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And proclamation was made in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble together into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the ancients, all his substance should be taken away, and he should be cast out of the company of them that were returned from captivity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> gathered themselves together to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> within three days, in the ninth month, the twentieth day of the month: and all the people sat in the street of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, trembling because of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the rain.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> stood up, and said to them: You have transgressed, and taken strange wives, to add to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And now make confession to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from your strange wives.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And all the multitude answered and said with a loud voice: According to thy word unto us, so be it done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But as the people are many, and it is time of rain, and we are not able to stand without, and it is not a work of one day or two, (for we have exceedingly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in this matter),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Let rulers be appointed in all the multitude: and in all our cities, let them that have taken strange wives come at the times appointed, and with them the ancients and the judges of every city, until the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be turned away from us for this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of Azahel, and Jaasia the son of Thecua were appointed over this, and Mesollam and Sebethai, <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, helped them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the children of the captivity did so. And <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> heads of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in the houses of their fathers, and all by their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>, went and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they made an end with all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And there were found among the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that had taken strange wives: Of the sons of Josue the son of Josedec, and his brethren, Maasia, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Godolia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they gave their hands to put away their wives, and to offer for their offence a ram of the flock.</span>
