<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So that one could not distinguish the voice of the shout of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, from the noise of the weeping of the people: for one with another the people shouted with a loud shout, and the voice was heard afar off.</span></p>
