<div class="h1a">The Samaritans by their letter to the king hinder the building.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> heard that the children of the captivity were building a <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they came to Zorobabel, and the chief of the fathers, and said to them: Let us build with you, for we seek your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as ye do: behold we have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to him, since the days of Asor Haddan king of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, who brought us hither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But Zorobabel, and Josue, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to them: You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but we ourselves alone will build to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, as Cyrus king of the Persians hath commanded us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then the people of the land hindered the hands of the people of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and troubled them in building.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their design all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of the Persians.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And in the reign of <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">Assuerus</a>, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Assuerus...</strong> Otherwise called Cambyses the son and successor of Cyrus. He is also in the following verse <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Artaxerxes, a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> common to almost all the kings of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And in the days of <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">Artaxerxes</a>, <a href="../cathen/02526d.htm">Beselam</a>, Mithridates, and Thabeel, and the rest that were in the council wrote to Artaxerxes king of the Persians: and the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> of accusation was written in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, and was read in the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> tongue.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a> wrote a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to king Artaxerxes, in this manner:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a> and the rest of their counsellors, the Dinites, and the Apharsathacites, the Therphalites, the Apharsites, the Erchuites, the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>, the Susanechites, the Dievites, and the Elamites,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the rest of the nations, whom the great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Asenaphar brought over: and made to dwell in the cities of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and in the rest of the countries of this side of the river in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> (This is the copy of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>, which they sent to him:) To Artaxerxes the king, thy servants, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are on this side of the river, send greeting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Be it known to the king, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who came up from thee to us, are come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a rebellious and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> city, which they are building, setting up the ramparts thereof and repairing the walls.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And now be it known to the king, that if this city be built up, and the walls thereof repaired, they will not pay tribute nor toll, nor yearly revenues, and this loss will fall upon the kings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But we remembering the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> that we have eaten in the palace, and because we count it a crime to see the king wronged, have therefore sent and certified the king,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> That search may be made in the books of the histories of thy fathers, and thou shalt find written in the records: and shalt know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to the kings and provinces, and that wars were raised therein of old time: for which cause also the city was destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> We certify the king, that if this city be built, and the walls thereof repaired, thou shalt have no possession on this side of the river.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The king sent word to Reum Beelteem and Samsai the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and to the rest that were in their council, inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and to the rest beyond the river, sending greeting and peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The accusation, which you have sent to us, hath been plainly read before me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I commanded: and search hath been made, and it is found, that this city of old time hath rebelled against kings, and seditions and wars have been raised therein.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For there have been powerful kings in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who have had dominion over all the country that is beyond the river: and have received tribute, and toll and revenues.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now therefore hear the sentence: Hinder those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that this city be not built, till further orders be given by me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> See that you be not negligent in executing this, lest by little and little the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> grow to the hurt of the kings.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now the copy of the edict of king Artaxerxes was read before Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and their counsellors: and they went up in haste to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and hindered them with arm and power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Then the work of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was interrupted, and ceased till the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.</span></p>
