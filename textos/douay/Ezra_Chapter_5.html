<h1>Ezra Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">By the exhortation of Aggeus, and Zacharias, the people proceed in building the temple. Which their enemies strive in vain to hinder.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now Aggeus the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and Zacharias the son of Addo, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then rose up Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue the son of Josedec, and began to build the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and with them were the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> helping them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And at the same time came to them Thathanai, who was governor beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and their counsellors: and said thus to them: Who hath given you counsel to build this house, and to repair the walls thereof?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> In answer to which we gave them the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who were the promoters of that building.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But the eye of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was upon the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and they could not hinder them. And it was agreed that the matter should be referred to Darius, and then they should give satisfaction concerning that accusation.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The copy of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> that Thathanai governor of the country beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and his counsellors the Arphasachites, who dwelt beyond the river, sent to Darius the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> which they sent him, was written thus: To Darius the king all peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Be it known to the king, that we went to the province of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, to the house of the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which they are building with unpolished stones, and timber is laid in the walls: and this work is carried on diligently and advanceth in their hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And we asked those ancients, and said to them thus: Who hath given you authority to build this house, and to repair these walls?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> We asked also of them their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>, that we might give thee notice: and we have written the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are the chief among them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they answered us in these words, saying: We are the servants of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, and we are building a <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> that was built these many years ago, and which a great king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> built and set up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But after that our fathers had provoked the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, he delivered them into the hands of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon the Chaldean</a>: and he destroyed this house, and carried away the people to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But in the first year of Cyrus the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, king Cyrus set forth a decree, that this <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> should be built.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the vessels also of gold and silver of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> had taken out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, that was in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and had brought them to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of Babylon</a>, king Cyrus brought out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of Babylon</a>, and they were delivered to one Sassabasar, whom also he appointed governor,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And said to him: Take these vessels, and go, and put them in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and let the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> be built in its place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then came this same Sassabasar, and laid the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and from that time until now it is in building, and is not yet finished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now therefore if it seem <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the king, let him search in the king's library, which is in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, whether it hath been decreed by Cyrus the king, that the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> should be built, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</span></p>
