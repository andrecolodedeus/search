<div class="h1a">King Darius favors the building and contributes to it.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then king Darius gave orders, and they searched in the library of the books that were laid up in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And there was found in Ecbatana, which is a castle in the province of <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>, a book in which this record was written.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> In the first year of Cyrus the king: Cyrus the king decreed, that the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> should be built, which is in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the place where they may offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and that they lay the foundations that may support the height of threescore cubits, and the breadth of threescore cubits,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Three rows of unpolished stones, and so rows of new timber: and the charges shall be given out of the king's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And also let the golden and silver vessels of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> took out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of Jerusalem</a>, and brought to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, be restored, and carried back to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of Jerusalem</a> to their place, which also were placed in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now therefore Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, Stharbuzanai, and your counsellors the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, depart far from them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And let that <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> be built by the governor of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and by their ancients, that they may build that <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> in its place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> I also have commanded what must be done by those ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> may be built, to wit, that of the king's chest, that is, of the tribute that is paid out of the country beyond the river, the charges be diligently given to those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, lest the work be hindered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And if it shall be necessary, let calves also, and lambs, and kids, for <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, wheat, <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, wine, and oil, according to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that are in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, be given them day by day, that there be no complaint in any thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And let them offer <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblations</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the life of the king, and of his children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I have made a decree: That if any whosoever, shall alter this commandment, a beam be taken from his house, and set up, and he be nailed upon it, and his house be confiscated.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And may the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that hath caused his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> to dwell there, destroy all kingdoms, and the people that shall put out their hand to resist, and to destroy the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, that is in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. I Darius have made the decree, which I will have diligently complied with.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So then Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and his counsellors diligently executed what Darius the king had commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> built, and prospered according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of Aggeus the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and of Zacharias the son of Addo: and they built and finished, by the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and by the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes kings of the Persians.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they were finishing this <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, until the third day of the month of <a href="../cathen/01136a.htm">Adar</a>, which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they offered at the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, a hundred calves, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> for all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> twelve he goats, according to the number of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they set the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in their divisions, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> in their courses over the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of Moses</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> of the captivity kept the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a>, on the fourteenth day of the first month.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> were purified as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: all were clean to kill the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">phase</a> for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and themselves.</span>
