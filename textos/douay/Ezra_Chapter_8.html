<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I gathered them together to the river, which runneth down to Ahava, and we stayed there three days: and I sought among the people and among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a>, and found none there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Semeias, and Elnathan, and Jarib, and another Elnathan, and <a href="../cathen/10711a.htm">Nathan</a>, and Zacharias, and Mosollam, chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and Joiarib, and Elnathan, wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> hand of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon us, they brought us a most learned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the sons of Moholi the son of <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Sarabias and his sons, and his brethren eighteen,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And I proclaimed there a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> by the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, and might ask of him a right way for us and for our children, and for all our substance. <span class="stiki"><strong>And I proclaimed a fast...</strong> It is not enough to part from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, that is, figuratively from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but we must also do works of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>; and therefore <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> here proclaimed an extraordinary <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> to those that were come from captivity. This shows that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> was commanded and practised from the earliest times.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For I was ashamed to ask the king for aid and for horsemen, to defend us from the enemy in the way: because we had said to the king: The hand of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is upon all them that seek him in goodness: and his power and strength, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon all them that forsake him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And we <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a>, and besought our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for this: and it fell out prosperously unto us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And I separated twelve of the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Sarabias, and Hasabias, and with them ten of their brethren,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And I weighed unto them the silver and gold, and the vessels <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of our God</a>, which the king and his counsellors, and his princes, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that were found had offered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And I weighed to their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred vessels of silver, and a hundred talents of gold,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And twenty cups of gold, of a thousand solids, and two vessels of the best shining brass, beautiful as gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And I said to them: You are the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the vessels are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the silver and gold, that is freely offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Watch ye and keep them, till you deliver them by weight before the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and the heads of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, into the treasure of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> received the weight of the silver and gold, and the vessels, to carry them to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of our God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then we set forward from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and the hand of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And we came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and we stayed there three days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And on the fourth day the silver and the gold, and the vessels were weighed in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of our God</a> by the hand of Meremoth the son of Urias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and with him was <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabad the son of Josue, and Noadaia the son of Benoi, <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> According to the number and weight of everything: and all the weight was written at that time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Moreover the children of them that had been carried away that were come out of the captivity, offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, twelve calves for all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he goats for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: all for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And they gave the king's edicts to the lords that were from the king's <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, and the governors beyond the river, and they furthered the people and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>.</span></p>
