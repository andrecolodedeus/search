<div class="h1a">Esdras mourns for the transgression of the people: his confession and prayer.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after these things were accomplished, the princes came to me, saying: The people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, and from their abominations, namely, of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethites</a>, and the Pherezites, and the Jebusites, and the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong></strong> This shows how <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> it is to <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">intermarry</a> with those that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbids us, on account of the danger of perversion and falling off from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, and they have mingled the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seed with the people of the lands. And the hand of the princes and magistrates hath been first in this transgression.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when I had heard this word, I rent my mantle and my coat, and plucked off the hairs of my head and my <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, and I sat down mourning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And there were assembled to me all that feared the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because of the transgression of those that were come from the captivity, and I sat sorrowful, until the evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And at the evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> I rose up from my affliction, and having rent my mantle and my garment, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And said: My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I am confounded and ashamed to lift up my face to thee: for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> are multiplied over our heads, and our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are grown up even unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> From the days of our fathers: and we ourselves also have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> grievously unto this day, and for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> we and our kings, and our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands, and to the sword, and to captivity, and to spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is at this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And now as a little, and for a moment has our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> been made before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, to leave us a remnant, and give us a pin in his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, and that our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would enlighten our eyes, and would give us a little life in our bondage. <span class="stiki"><strong>A pin...</strong> or nail, here signifies a small settlement or holding; which <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> begs for, to preserve even a part of the people, who, by their great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> had incurred the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For we are bondmen, and in our bondage our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not forsaken us, but hath extended mercy upon us before the king of the Persians, to give us life, and to set up the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of our God</a>, and to rebuild the desolations thereof, and to give us a fence in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And now, O our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Which thou hast commanded by the hand of thy servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, saying: The land which you go to possess, is an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> land, according to the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the people, and of other lands, with their abominations, who have filled it from mouth to mouth with their filth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, and take not their daughters for your sons, and seek not their peace, nor their prosperity for ever: that you may be strengthened, and may eat the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the land, and may have your children your heirs for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And after all that is come upon us, for our most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deeds, and our great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, seeing that thou our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hast saved us from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and hast given us a deliverance as at this day,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> That we should not turn away, nor break thy commandments, nor join in marriage with the people of these abominations. Art thou <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us unto utter destruction, not to leave us a remnant to be saved?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, thou art <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: for we remain yet to be saved as at this day. Behold we are before thee in our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for there can be no standing before thee in this matter.</span></p>
