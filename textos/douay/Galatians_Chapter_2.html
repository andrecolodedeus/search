<div class="h1a">The apostle's preaching was approved of by the other apostles. The Gentiles were not to be constrained to the observance of the law.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, taking Titus also with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I went up according to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> and communicated to them the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> which I preach among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But neither Titus, who was with me, being a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, was compelled to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But because of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty which we have in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, that they might bring us into servitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> To whom we yielded not by subjection: no, not for an hour: that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> might continue with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time it is nothing to me, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> accepteth not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>): for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">uncircumcision</a>, as to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was that of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The gospel of the uncircumcision...</strong> The preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">uncircumcised</a>, that is, to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> was called in an extraordinary manner to be the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, besides his general commission over the whole flock (<a href="../douay/joh021.htm#verse15">John 21:15</a>, etc.), had a peculiar charge of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">people of the circumcision</a>, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> (For he who wrought in <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostleship</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> wrought in me also among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that was given to me, <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a> and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and they unto the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Only that we should be mindful of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>: which same thing also I was careful to do.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a> was come to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. <span class="stiki"><strong>I withstood, etc...</strong> The fault that is here noted in the conduct of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from the table of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of giving offence to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a>; but this, in such circumstances, when his so doing might be of ill consequence to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who might be induced thereby to think themselves <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to conform to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> way of living, to the prejudice of their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> liberty. Neither was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> reprehending him any argument against his supremacy; for in such cases an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">admonish</a> his superior.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For before that some came from <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, he did eat with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fearing</a> them who were of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And to his dissimulation the rest of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consented</a>: so that <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> also was led by them into that dissimulation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, I said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a> before them all: If thou, being a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, livest after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and not as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do, how dost thou compel the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to live as do the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> We by nature are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: and not of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, sinners.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But if, while we seek to be <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we ourselves also are found sinners, is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> then the minister of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For I, through the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, am dead to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, that I may live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> I am nailed to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I live, now not I: but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> liveth in me.
