<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> or by the hearing of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Are you so foolish that, whereas you began in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, you would now be made <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> by the flesh?</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Brethren (I speak after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>), yet a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> testament, if it be confirmed, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> nor addeth to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> To <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> were the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a> made and to his seed.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now this I say: that the testament which was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which was made after four hundred and thirty years doth not disannul, to make the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> of no effect.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For if the inheritance be of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, it is no more of <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Why then was the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>? It was set because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">transgressions</a>, until the seed should come to whom he made the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, being ordained by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the hand of a <a href="../cathen/10118a.htm">mediator</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Because of transgressions...</strong> To restrain them from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and threats. <strong>Ordained by angels...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> was delivered by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, speaking in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who was the <a href="../cathen/10118a.htm">mediator</a>, on this occasion, between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the people.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now a <a href="../cathen/10118a.htm">mediator</a> is not of one: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> hath concluded all under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, might be given to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hath concluded all under sin...</strong> that is, hath declared all to be under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from which they could not be delivered but by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> seed.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> was our pedagogue in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: that we might be <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Pedagogue...</strong> That is, schoolmaster, conductor, or instructor.</span></span>
