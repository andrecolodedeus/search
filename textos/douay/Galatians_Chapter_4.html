<div class="h1a">Christ has freed us from the servitude of the law. We are the freeborn sons of Abraham.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> As long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But is under tutors and governors until the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> appointed by the father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world. <span class="stiki"><strong>Under the elements, etc...</strong> That is, under the first rudiments of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, in which the carnal <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were trained up; or under those corporeal creatures, used in their manifold <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">rites</a>, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But when the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> was come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent his <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> That he might <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeem</a> them who were under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>: that we might receive the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">adoption of sons</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And because you are sons, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> into your hearts, crying: <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba, Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Therefore, now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But then indeed, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you served them who, by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, are not gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But now, after that you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or rather are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: how turn you again to the weak and <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a> elements which you desire to serve again?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> You observe days and months and times, and years. <span class="stiki"><strong>You observe days, etc...</strong> He speaks not of the observation of the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's day</a>, or other <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">Christian festivals</a>; but either of the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> observation of days lucky and unlucky; or else of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> festivals, to the observance of which, certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> teachers sought to induce the Galatians.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I am <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a> of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Be ye as I, because I also am as you brethren, I beseech you. You have not injured me at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> to you heretofore: and your <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> in my flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> You <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> not, nor rejected: but received me as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Where is then your <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessedness</a>? For I bear you <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes and would have given them to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> They are <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> thing always: and not only when I am present with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be formed in you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I would willingly be present with you now and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Tell me, you that desire to be under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, have you not read the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For it is written that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had two sons: the one by a bondwoman and the other by a free woman.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman was by <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sina</a>, engendering unto <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a>, which is Agar.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Sina</a> is a mountain in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, which hath affinity to that <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> which now is: and is in <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a> with her children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But that <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> which is above is free: which is our mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Now we, brethren, as <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> was, are the children of <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But as then he that was born according to the flesh <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him that was after the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>: so also it is now.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But what saith the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman but of the free: by the freedom wherewith <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has made us free.</span></p>
