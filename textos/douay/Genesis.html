<h1>Genesis</h1>

<p>This book is so called from its treating of the <em>Generation</em>, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> and the beginning of the world. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a> call it <em>Beresith</em>, from the word with which it begins. It contains not only the history of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">world</a>; but also an account of its progress during the space of 2369 years, that is, until the death of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">PENTATEUCH</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)
