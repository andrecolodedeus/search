<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: Be light made. And light was made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw the light that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and he divided the light from the darkness.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the earth brought forth the <a href="../cathen/12149a.htm">green herb</a>, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its kind.

But on the fourth <a href="../cathen/07310a.htm">day</a> he ordered and distributed this light, and made the sun, moon, and stars. The moon, though much less than the stars, is here called a great light, from its giving a far greater light to the earth than any of them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he set them in the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament of heaven</a> to shine upon the earth.</span>
