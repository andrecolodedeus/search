<div class="h1a">The tower of Babel. The confusion of tongues. The genealogy of Shem down to Abram.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the earth was of one tongue, and of the same speech.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when they removed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And each one said to his neighbour: Come let us make brick, and bake them with fire. And they had brick instead of stones, and slime instead of mortar:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they said: Come, let us make a <a href="../cathen/02177b.htm">city</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15005b.htm">tower</a>, the top whereof may reach to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and let us make our <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> famous before we be scattered abroad into all lands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> came down to see the <a href="../cathen/02177b.htm">city</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15005b.htm">tower</a>, which the children of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> were building.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all have one tongue: and they have begun to do this, neither will they leave off from their designs, till they accomplish them in deed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and there confound their tongue, that they may not understand one another's speech.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And so the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> scattered them from that place into all lands, and they ceased to build the <a href="../cathen/02177b.htm">city</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And therefore the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof was called <a href="../cathen/02177b.htm">Babel</a>, because there the language of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries. <span class="stiki"><strong>Babel...</strong> That is, confusion.</span></span></p>
