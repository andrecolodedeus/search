<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, and magnify thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and thou shalt be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> them that <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, and <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> them that <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> thee, and IN THEE shall all the kindreds of the earth be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> went out as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him, and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> went with him: <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> was seventy-five years old when he went forth from <a href="../cathen/03378b.htm">Haran</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he took <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a> his wife, and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> his brother's son, and all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a> which they had gathered, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which they had gotten in <a href="../cathen/03378b.htm">Haran</a>: and they went out to go into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>. And when they were come into it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> passed through the country unto the place of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, as far as the noble vale: now the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> was at that time in the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who had appeared to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, he there pitched his tent, having <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> on the west, and Hai on the east: he built there also an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and called upon his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> went forward, going and proceeding on to the south.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And there came a famine in the country: and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when he was near to enter into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he said to <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a> his wife: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou art a beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And that when the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they will <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me, and <a href="../cathen/01032b.htm">keep</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may be well used for thee, and that my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may live for thy sake. <span class="stiki"><strong>My sister...</strong> This was no <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; because she was his niece, being daughter to his brother Aran, and therefore, in the style of the Hebrews, she might <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be called his sister, as <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> is called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram's</a> brother, <a href="../douay/gen014.htm#verse14">Genesis 14:14</a>. See <a href="../douay/gen020.htm#verse12">Genesis 20:12</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> was come into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> saw the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that she was very beautiful.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the princes told <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and praised her before him: and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was taken into the house of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they used <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen and he asses, and men servants, and maid servants, and she asses, and camels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> scourged <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> and his house with most grievous stripes for <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram's</a> wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now therefore there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> gave his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> orders concerning <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>: and they led him away and his wife, and all that he had.</span></p>
