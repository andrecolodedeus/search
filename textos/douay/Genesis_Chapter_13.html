<div class="h1a">Abram and Lot part from each other. God's promise to Abram.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> went up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he and his wife, and all that he had, and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> with him into the south.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he was very <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> in possession of gold and silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he returned by the way, that he came, from the south to <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> and Hai,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> In the place of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> which he had made before, and there he called upon the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> also, who was with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>, had flocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a> was great, and they could not dwell together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>. And at that time the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> and the Pherezite dwelled in that country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> therefore said to <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>: Let there be no quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen: for we are brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me, I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right: if thou choose the right hand, I will pass to the left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> lifting up his eyes, saw all the <a href="../cathen/11646b.htm">country about the Jordan</a>, which was watered throughout, before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom and Gomorrha</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise of the Lord</a>, and like <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> as one comes to <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Segor</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> chose to himself the <a href="../cathen/11646b.htm">country about the Jordan</a>, and he departed from the east: and they were separated one brother from the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> dwelt in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>: and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> abode in the towns, that were about the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and dwelt in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> were very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and sinners before the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> beyond measure.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>, after <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> was separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee, and to thy seed <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">for ever</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be able to number the dust of the earth, he shall be able to number thy seed also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Arise and walk through the land in the length, and the breadth thereof: for I will give it to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> So <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> removing his tent, came, and dwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>: and he built there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
