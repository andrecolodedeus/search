<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass at that time, that <a href="../cathen/01441a.htm">Amraphel, king of Sennaar</a>, and Arioch, king of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Chodorlahomor, king of the Elamites, and Thadal, king of nations,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Bara, king of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and against Bersa, king of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>, and against Sennaab, king of Adama, and against Semeber, king of Seboim, and against the king of <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Bala</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Segor</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> All these came together into the <a href="../cathen/11646b.htm">woodland vale</a>, which now is the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">salt sea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they revolted from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And in the fourteenth year came Chodorlahomor, and the kings that were with him: and they smote the Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim, and the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Save of Cariathaim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir, even to the plains of Pharan, which is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they returned, and came to the fountain of Misphat, the same is <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>: and they smote all the country of the <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhean</a> that dwelt in <a href="../cathen/05428a.htm">Asasonthamar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and the king of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>, and the king of Adama, and the king of Seboim, and the king of <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Bala</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Segor</a>, went out: and they set themselves against them in battle array, in the <a href="../cathen/11646b.htm">woodland vale</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the Elamites, and Thadal king of nations, and <a href="../cathen/01441a.htm">Amraphel king of Sennaar</a>, and Arioch king of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>: four kings against five.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/11646b.htm">woodland vale</a> had many pits of slime.

Bituminis...</strong> This was a kind of pitch, which served for mortar in the building of <a href="../cathen/02177b.htm">Babel</a>, <a href="../douay/gen011.htm#verse3">Genesis 11:3</a>, and was used by <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> in pitching the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they took all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodomites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrhites</a>, and all their victuals, and went their way:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> also, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram's</a> brother, who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And behold one, that had escaped, told <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram the Hebrew</a>, who dwelt in the vale of Mambre the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, the brother of Escol, and the brother of Aner: for these had made a league with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> had heard, to wit, that his brother <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> was taken, he numbered of the servants born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, well appointed: and pursued them to <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And dividing his company, he rushed upon them in the night, and defeated them: and pursued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left hand of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he brought back all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> his brother, with his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also, and the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> went out to meet him, after he returned from the slaughter of Chodorlahomor, and of the kings that were with him in the vale of Save, which is the king's vale.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Salem</a>, bringing forth bread and wine, for he was the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most high God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> him, and said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most high God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>: Give me the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and the rest take to thyself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he answered him: I lift up my hand to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God the most high</a>, the possessor of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> That from the very woofthread unto the shoe latchet, I will not take of any <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> that are thine, lest thou say: I have enriched <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>.</span>
