<div class="h1a">Abram marries Hagar, who brings forth Ishmael.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a>, the wife of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>, had brought forth no children: but having a handmaid, an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Agar,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> She said to her husband: Behold, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my handmaid, it may be I may have children of her at least. And when he agreed to her request,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> She took Agar the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and gave her to her husband to wife. <span class="stiki"><strong>To wife...</strong> Plurality of wives, though contrary to the primitive institution of <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>, <a href="../douay/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis 2:24</a>, was by divine dispensation allowed to the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarchs</a>: which allowance seems to have continued during the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ our Lord</a> reduced <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> to its primitive institution (<a href="../douay/mat019.htm">Matthew 19</a>).</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he went in to her. But she perceiving that she was with child, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> her mistress.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>: Thou dost <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> me. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judge</a> between me and thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use her as it pleaseth thee. And when <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a> afflicted her, she ran away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> having found her, by a fountain of water in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, which is in the way to Sur in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He said to her: Agar, handmaid of <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a>, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she answered: I flee from the face of <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a>, my mistress.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> said to her: Return to thy mistress, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> thyself under her hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath heard thy affliction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He shall be a wild <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: his hand will be against all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And she called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that spoke unto her: Thou the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who hast seen me. For she said: Verily, here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Therefore she called that <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> of him that liveth and seeth me. The same is between <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a> and Barad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Agar brought forth a son to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>: who called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> was four score and six years old when Agar brought him forth <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a>.</span></p>
