<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after he began to be ninety and nine years old, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared to him: and said unto him: I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>: walk before me, and be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I will make my covenant between me and thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> fell flat on his face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to him: I am, and my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Neither shall thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> be called any more <em>Abram</em>: but thou shalt be called <em>Abraham</em>: because I have made thee a father of many nations. <span class="stiki"><strong>Abram...</strong> in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, signifies a high father: but <em>Abraham</em>, the father of the multitude; <em>Sarai</em> signifies <em>my Lady</em>, but <em>Sara</em> absolutely <em>Lady</em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I will make thee increase exceedingly, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and between thy seed after thee in their <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>, by a perpetual covenant: to be a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I will give to thee, and to thy seed, the land of thy sojournment, all the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, for a perpetual <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possession</a>, and I will be their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Again <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: And thou therefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed after thee in their <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> This is my covenant which you shall observe between me and you, and thy seed after thee: All the male kind of you shall be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And you shall <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcise</a> the flesh of your foreskin, that it may be for a sign of the covenant between me and you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> An infant of eight days old shall be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> among you, every manchild in your <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>: he that is born in the house, as well as the bought servant, shall be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and whosoever is not of your stock:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And my covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The male whose flesh of his foreskin shall not be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken my covenant.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said also to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sarai</a> thy wife thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">call</a> <em>Sarai</em>, but <em>Sara</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> her, and of her I will give thee a son, whom I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a>, and he shall become nations, and kings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a> shall spring from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> fell upon his face, and laughed, saying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou, be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> that is ninety years old bring forth?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: O that <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a> may live before thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and I will establish my covenant with him for a perpetual covenant, and with his seed after him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And as for <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a> I have also heard thee. Behold, I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> him, and increase, and multiply him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But my covenant I will establish with <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> shall bring forth to thee at this time in the next year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when he had left off speaking with him, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went up from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> took <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a> his son, and all that were born in his house: and all whom he had bought, every male among the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of his house: and he <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the flesh of their foreskin forthwith the very same day, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was ninety and nine years old, when he <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the flesh of his foreskin.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a> his son was full thirteen years old at the time of his <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> The selfsame day was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a> his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And all the men of his house, as well they that were born in his house, as the bought servants and strangers, were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with him.</span></p>
