<div class="h1a">Angels are entertained by Abraham. They foretell the birth of Isaac. Abraham's prayer for the men of Sodom.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to him in the vale of Mambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent, in the very heat of the day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when he had lifted up his eyes, there appeared to him three <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> standing near to him: and as soon as he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> down to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, if I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away from thy servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But I will fetch a little water, and <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash ye your feet</a>, and rest ye under the tree.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I will set a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart, afterwards you shall pass on: for therefore are you come aside to your servant. And they said: Do as thou hast spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> made haste into the tent to <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a>, and said to her: Make haste, temper together three measures of flour, and make cakes upon the hearth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he himself ran to the herd, and took from thence a calf, very tender and very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and gave it to a young man, who made haste and boiled it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He took also butter and milk, and the calf which he had boiled, and set before them: but he stood by them under the tree.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when they had eaten, they said to him: Where is <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> thy wife? He answered: Lo she is in the tent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to him: I will return and come to thee at this time, life accompanying, and <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a>, thy wife, shall have a son. Which when <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> heard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now they were both old, and far advanced in years, and it had ceased to be with <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> after the manner of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And she laughed secretly, saying: After I am grown old, and my lord is an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, shall I give myself to pleasure?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: Why did <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> laugh, saying: Shall I, who am an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, bear a child indeed?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Is there any thing hard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? According to appointment I will return to thee at this same time, life accompanying, and <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> shall have a son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> denied, saying: I did not laugh: for she was <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Nay; but thou didst laugh.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> rose up from thence, they turned their eyes towards <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> walked with them, bringing them on the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Can I hide from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> what I am about to do:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will command his children, and his household after him, to keep the way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and do judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: that for <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> sake, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may bring to effect all the things he hath spoken unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: The cry of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom and Gomorrha</a> is multiplied, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is become exceedingly grievous.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I will go down and see whether they have done according to the cry that is come to me; or whether it be not so, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>I will go down, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> here accommodates his discourse to the way of speaking and acting amongst <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> all things, and needeth not to go anywhere for information. Note here, that two of the three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> went away immediately for <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>; whilst the third, who represented the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, remained with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they turned themselves from thence, and went their way to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>: but <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as yet stood before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And drawing nigh, he said: Wilt thou destroy the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> with the wicked?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> If there be fifty <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the city, shall they perish withal? and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, if they be therein?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to slay the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> with the wicked, and for the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> to be in like case as the wicked; this is not beseeming thee: thou who <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgest</a> all the earth, wilt not make this <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: If I find in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> fifty <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> within the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answered, and said: Seeing I have once begun, I will speak to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, whereas I am dust and ashes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> What if there be five less than fifty <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>? wilt thou for five and forty destroy the whole city: And he said: I will not destroy it, if I find five and forty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And again he said to him: But if forty be found there, what wilt thou do? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake of forty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saith he, be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, I beseech thee, if I speak: What if thirty shall be found there? He answered: I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will speak to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: What if twenty be found there? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> I beseech thee, saith he, be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, if I speak yet once more: What if ten shall be found there? And he said: I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> departed, after he had left speaking to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> returned to his place.</span></p>
