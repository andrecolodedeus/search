<h1>Genesis Chapter 19</h1>
<div class="h1a">Lot, entertaining Angels in his house, is delivered from Sodom, which is destroyed: his wife for looking back is turned into a statue of salt.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in the evening, and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> was sitting in the gate of the city. And seeing them, he rose up and went to meet them: and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">worshipped</a> prostrate to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in to the house of your servant, and lodge there: <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash your feet</a>, and in the morning you shall go on your way. And they said: No, but we will abide in the street.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He pressed them very much to turn in unto him: and when they were come into his house, he made them a feast, and baked <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened bread</a>, and they ate:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But before they went to bed, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the city beset the house, both young and old, all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a> together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they called <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, and said to him: Where are the men that came in to thee at night? bring them out hither, that we may know them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> went out to them, and shut the door after him, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do not commit this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> I have two daughters who, as yet, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">have not known man</a>; I will bring them out to you, and abuse you them as it shall please you, so that you do no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to these men, because they are come in under the shadow of my roof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But they said: Get thee back thither. And again: Thou camest in, said they, as a stranger, was it to be a judge? therefore we will afflict thee more than them. And they pressed very <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> upon <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>: and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And behold the men put out their hand, and drew in <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> unto them, and shut the door.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And them, that were without, they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest, so that they could not find the door.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they said to <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>: Hast thou here any of thine? son in law, or sons, or daughters, all that are thine bring them out of this city:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For we will destroy this place, because their cry is grown loud before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who hath sent us to destroy them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> went out, and spoke to his sons in law that were to have his daughters, and said: Arise: get you out of this place, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will destroy this city. And he seemed to them to speak as it were in jest.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when it was morning, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> pressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also perish in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And as he lingered, they took his hand, and the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spared him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they brought him forth, and set him without the city: and there they spoke to him, saying: Save thy life: look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about: but save thy self in the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> said to them: I beseech thee, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Because thy servant hath found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before thee, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me, in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> seize me, and I die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> There is this city here at hand, to which I may flee, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in it: is it not a little one, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he said to him: Behold also in this, I have heard thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Make haste, and be saved there: because I cannot do any thing till thou go in thither. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that city was called <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Segor</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Segor...</strong> That is, a little one.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The sun was risen upon the earth, and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> entered into <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Segor</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> rained upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom and Gomorrha</a> brimstone and fire from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> out of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he destroyed these cities, and all the country about, all the inhabitants of the cities, and all things that spring from the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a statue of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>And his wife...</strong> As a standing memorial to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to proceed in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and not to look back to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or its allurements.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> got up early in the morning, and in the place where he had stood before with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> He looked towards <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom and Gomorrha</a>, and the whole land of that country: and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> destroyed the cities of that country, remembering <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, he delivered <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> out of the destruction of the cities wherein he had dwelt.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> went up out of <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Segor</a>, and abode in the mountain, and his two daughters with him (for he was <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a> to stay in <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Segor</a>) and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the elder said to the younger: Our father is old, and there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> left on the earth, to come in unto us after the manner of the whole earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Come, let us make him <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunk with wine</a>, and let us <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">lie with him</a>, that we may preserve seed of our father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they made their father <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drink wine</a> that night: and the elder went in, and <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">lay with her father</a>: but he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">perceived</a> not, neither when his daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the next day the elder said to the younger: Behold I lay last night with my father, let us make him <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drink wine</a> also to night, and thou shalt <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">lie with him</a>, that we may save seed of our father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> They made their father <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drink wine</a> that night also, and the younger daughter went in, and <a href="../cathen/07717a.htm">lay with him</a>: and neither then did he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">perceive</a> when she lay down, nor when she rose up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> So the two daughters of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> were with child by their father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And the elder bore a son, and she called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Moab: he is the father of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> The younger also bore a son, and she called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Ammon; that is, the son of my people: he is the father of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a> unto this day.</span></p>
