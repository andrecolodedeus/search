<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> So the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">seventh day</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ended his <a href="../cathen/07310a.htm">work</a> which he had made: and he rested on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">seventh day</a> from all his <a href="../cathen/07310a.htm">work</a> which he had done. <span class="stiki"><strong>He rested, etc...</strong> That is, he ceased to make or <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">create</a> any new kinds of things. Though, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> tells us, <a href="../douay/joh005.htm#verse17">John 5:17</a>, "He still worketh", viz., by conserving and governing all things, and creating <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">seventh day</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> it: because in it he had rested from all his work which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and made.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> These are the <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth, when they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, in the day that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to till the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But a spring rose out of the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> formed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">breath of life</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> became a <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> had planted a <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise of pleasure</a> from the beginning: wherein he placed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom he had formed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> also in the midst of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>: and the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The tree of life...</strong> So called because it had that quality, that by eating of the fruit of it, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would have been preserved in a constant state of health, vigour, and strength, and would not have died at all. <strong>The tree of knowledge...</strong> To which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">deceitful serpent</a> falsely attributed the power of imparting a superior kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, beyond that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was pleased to give.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And a river went out of the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">place of pleasure</a> to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the gold of that land is very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> took <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and put him into the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise of pleasure</a>, to dress it, and to keep it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> thou shalt eat:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But of the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, thou shalt not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> said: It is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to see what he would call them: for whatsoever <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> called any <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> creature the same is its <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> called all the beasts by their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> there was not found a helper like himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> cast a deep sleep upon <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> built the rib which he took from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> into a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: and brought her to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a>, because she was taken out of man.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Wherefore a man shall leave <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">two in one flesh</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they were both naked: to wit, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and his wife: and were not ashamed.</span></p>
