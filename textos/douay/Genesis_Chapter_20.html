<div class="h1a">Abraham sojourned in Gerara: Sarah is taken into King Abimelech's house, but by God's commandment is restored untouched.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> removed from thence to the south country, and dwelt between <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a> and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said of <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> his wife: She is my sister. So Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came to Abimelech in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> by night, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that thou hast taken: for she hath a husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, wilt thou slay a nation that is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and she say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of my heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to him: And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore I withheld thee from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> against me, and I suffered thee not to touch her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now therefore restore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his wife, for he is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: and he shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for thee, and thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night, called all his servants: and spoke all these words in their hearing, and all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were exceedingly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Abimelech called also for <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and said to him: What hast thou done to us? what have we offended thee in, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And again he expostulated with him, and said: What sawest thou, that thou hast done this?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answered: I thought with myself, saying: Perhaps there is not the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this place: and they will <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me for the sake of my wife:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Howbeit, otherwise also she is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">took her to wife</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> brought me out of my father's house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me this kindness: In every place, to which we shall come, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gave to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: and restored to him <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> his wife,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And said: The land is before you, dwell wheresoever it shall please thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And to <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> he said: Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver, this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go: and remember thou wast taken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> healed Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bore children:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech, on account of <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> wife.</span></p>
