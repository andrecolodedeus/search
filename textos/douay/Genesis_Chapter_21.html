<div class="h1a">Isaac is born. Hagar and Ishmael are cast forth.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> visited <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a>, as he had <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>: and fulfilled what he had spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had foretold her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his son, whom <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> bore him, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Isaac...</strong> This word signifies laughter.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> him the eighth day, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had commanded him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father, was <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> born.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And again she said: Who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> should hear that <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the child grew, and was weaned: and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> made a great feast on the day of his weaning.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> had seen the son of Agar, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, playing with <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, her son, she said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> took this grievously for his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> shall thy seed be called.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">great nation</a>, because he is thy seed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And she went her way, and sat overagainst him a great way off, as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting overagainst, she lifted up her voice and wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> heard the voice of the boy: and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a> called to Agar from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him a <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">great nation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> opened her eyes: and she saw a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well of water</a>, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and became a young man, an archer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army, said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with thee in all that thou dost.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">Swear</a> therefore by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said: I will <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he reproved Abimelech for a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well of water</a>, which his servants had taken away by force.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And Abimelech answered: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Then <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> set apart seven ewelambs of the flock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewelambs which thou hast set apart?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewelambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Therefore that place was called <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>; because there both of them did <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Bersabee...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they made a league for the <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">well of oath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And Abimelech and Phicol, the general of his army, arose and returned to the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Palestines</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> planted a grove in <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>, and there called upon the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God eternal</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he was a sojourner in the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Palestines</a> many days.</span></p>
