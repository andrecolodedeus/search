<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tempted <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and said to him: <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. And he answered: Here I am. <span class="stiki"><strong>God tempted, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tempteth no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../douay/jam001.htm#verse13">James 1:13</a>; but by trial and experiment maketh <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the world, and to ourselves, what we are, as here by this trial the singular <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was made manifest.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He said to him: Take thy only begotten son <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, whom thou <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a>, and go into the land of vision; and there thou shalt offer him for an <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> upon one of the mountains which I will show thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rising up in the night, saddled his ass, and took with him two young men, and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> his son: and when he had cut wood for the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, he went his way to the place which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass; I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipped</a>, will return to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he took the wood for the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and laid it upon <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> his son; and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they two went on together,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> said to his father: My father. And he answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will provide himself a victim for an <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, my son. So they went on together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they came to the place which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had shown him, where he built an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had bound <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> his son, he laid him on the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> upon the pile of wood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he put forth his hand, and took the sword, to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> called to him, saying: <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. And he answered: Here I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou fearest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram, amongst the briers, sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> instead of his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place, The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> seeth. Whereupon, even to this day, it is said: In the mountain the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will see.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> called to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> a second time from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> By my own self have I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and as the sand that is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And in thy seed shall all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> of the earth be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, because thou hast <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> my voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> returned to his young men, and they went to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a> together, and he dwelt there.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> After these things, it was told <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Hus, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, and Buz, his brother, and Camuel the father of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and Jedlaph,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca: these eight did Melcha bear to Nachor, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> brother.</span>
