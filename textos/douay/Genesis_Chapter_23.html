<div class="h1a">Sarah's death and burial in the field bought of Ephron.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> lived a hundred and twenty-seven years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And she died in the city of Arbee which is <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> came to mourn and weep for her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And after he rose up from the funeral obsequies, he spoke to the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">children of Heth</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I am a stranger and sojourner among you: give me the right of a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">burying place</a> with you, that I may bury my dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">children of Heth</a> answered, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> My lord, hear us, thou art a prince of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> among us: bury thy dead in our principal <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">sepulchres</a>: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall have power to hinder thee from burying thy dead in his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">sepulchre</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rose up, and bowed down to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a> of the land, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">children of Heth</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>Bowed down to the people...</strong> <em>Adoravit</em>, literally <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm"><em>adored</em></a>. But this word here, as well as in many other places in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin scriptures</a>, is used to signify only an <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">inferior honour and reverence</a> paid to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, expressed by a bowing down of the body.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And said to them: If it please your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that I should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede for me to Ephron the son of Seor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> That he may give me the <a href="../cathen/09502a.htm">double cave</a>, which he hath in the end of his field: For as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before you, for a <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possession</a> of a burying place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">children of Heth</a>. And Ephron made answer to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of the city, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou rather hearken to what I say: The field I deliver to thee, and the cave that is therein; in the presence of the children of my people, bury thy dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> bowed down before the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a> of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a>: I beseech thee to hear me: I will give money for the field; take it, and so will I bury my dead in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Ephron answered:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> My lord, hear me. The ground which thou desirest, is worth four hundred sicles of silver: this is the price between me and thee: but what is this? bury thy dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">children of Heth</a>, four hundred sicles of silver, of common current money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the field that before was Ephron's, wherein was the <a href="../cathen/09502a.htm">double cave</a>, looking towards Mambre, both it and the cave, and all the trees thereof, in all its limits round about,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Was made sure to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> for a <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possession</a>, in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">children of Heth</a>, and of all that went in at the gate of his city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And so <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> buried <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a>, his wife, in the <a href="../cathen/09502a.htm">double cave</a> of the field, that looked towards Mambre, this is <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the field was made sure to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the cave that was in it, for a <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possession</a> to bury in, by the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">children of Heth</a>.</span></p>
