<div class="h1a">Abraham's servant, sent by him into Mesopotamia, brings from thence Rebecca, who is married to Isaac.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was old, and advanced in age; and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him in all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said to the elder servant of his house, who was ruler over all he had: Put thy hand under my thigh,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> That I may make thee <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, that thou take not a wife for my son, of the daughters of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, among whom I dwell:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But that thou go to my own country and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>, and take a wife from thence for my son <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The servant answered: If the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> will not come with me into this land, must I bring thy son back again to the place from whence thou camest out?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said: Beware thou never bring my son back again thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, who took me out of my father's house, and out of my native country, who spoke to me, and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to me, saying: To thy seed will I give this land: he will send his <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">angel</a> before thee, and thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son. <span class="stiki"><strong>He will send his angel before thee...</strong> This shows that the Hebrews <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian angels</a> for their protection.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> will not follow thee, thou shalt not be bound by the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: only bring not my son back thither again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The servant, therefore, put his hand under the thigh of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, his lord, and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to him upon his word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he took ten camels of his master's herd, and departed, carrying something of all his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a> with him, and he set forward and went on to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when he had made the camels lie down without the town, near a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well of water</a>, in the evening, at the time when <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are wont to come out to draw water, he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my master, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, meet me today, I beseech thee, and show kindness to my master, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Behold, I stand nigh the spring of water, and the daughters of the inhabitants of this city will come out to draw water:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall say: Let down thy pitcher that I may drink: and she shall answer, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let it be the same whom thou hast provided for thy servant <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>: and by this, I shall understand that thou hast shown kindness to my master.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He had not yet ended these words within himself, and behold Rebecca came out, the daughter of Bathuel, son of Melcha, wife to Nachor the brother of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, having a pitcher on her shoulder:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> An exceeding comely maid, and a most beautiful <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and not known to man: and she went down to the spring, and filled her pitcher, and was coming back.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the servant ran to meet her, and said: Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And she answered: Drink, my lord. And quickly she let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when he had drunk, she said: I will draw water for thy camels also, till they all drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And pouring out the pitcher into the troughs, she ran back to the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> to draw water; and having drawn, she gave to all the camels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But he musing, beheld her with silence, desirous to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had made his journey prosperous or not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And after that the camels had drunk, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> took out golden earrings, weighing two sicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles weight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he said to her: Whose daughter art thou? tell me: is there any place in thy father's house to lodge?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And she said, moreover, to him: We have good store of both straw and hay, and a large place to lodge in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bowed himself down, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Saying: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of my master <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who hath not taken away his mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from my master, and hath brought me the straight way into the house of my master's brother.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Then the maid ran, and told in her mother's house all that she had heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And Rebecca had a brother, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>, who went out in haste to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when he had seen the earrings and bracelets in his sister's hands, and had heard all that she related, saying, Thus and thus the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spoke to me: he came to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who stood by the camels, and near to the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">spring of water</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And said to him: Come in, thou <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; why standest thou without? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he brought him into his lodging; and he unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and hay, and water to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash his feet</a>, and the feet of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were come with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And bread was set before him. But he said: I will not eat, till I tell my message. He answered him: Speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he said: I am the servant of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> my master wonderfully, and he is become great: and he hath given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, men servants and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> servants, camels and asses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a>, my master's wife, hath borne my master a son in her old age, and he hath given him all that he had.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And my master made me <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, in whose land I dwell:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But thou shalt go to my father's house, and shalt take a wife of my own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a> for my son:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But I answered my master: What if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> will not come with me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, said he, in whose sight I walk, will send his <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">angel</a> with thee, and will direct thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>, and of my father's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But thou shalt be clear from my <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, when thou shalt come to my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>, if they will not give thee one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And I came today to the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well of water</a>, and said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of my master, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, if thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now walk,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Behold, I stand by the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well of water</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, that shall come out to draw water, who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath prepared for my master's son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself, Rebecca appeared, coming with a pitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and she went down to the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> and drew water. And I said to her: Give me a little to drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou, and to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and she watered the camels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn her face, and I put bracelets on her hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And falling down, I <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of my master, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Wherefore, if you do according to mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with my master, tell me: but if it please you otherwise, tell me that also, that I may go to the right hand, or to the left.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> and Bathuel answered: The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word</a> hath proceeded from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy master's son, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> servant heard, falling down to the ground, he <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca, for a present. He offered gifts also to her brothers, and to her mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And a banquet was made, and they ate and drank together, and lodged there. And in the morning, the servant arose, and said: Let me depart, that I may go to my master.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And her brother and mother answered: Let the maid stay, at least, ten days with us, and afterwards she shall depart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Stay me not, said he, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And they said: Let us call the maid, and ask her will. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let us call the maid, and ask her will...</strong> Not as to her <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>, as she had already <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consented</a>, but of her quitting her parents and going to her husband.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And they called her, and when she was come, they asked: Wilt thou go with this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? She said: I will go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> So they sent her away, and her nurse, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> servant, and his company.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> Wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands; and may thy seed possess the gates of their enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels, followed the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: who with speed returned to his master.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> At the same time, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> was walking along the way to the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> which is <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">called</a> <em>Of the living and the seeing</em>: for he dwelt in the south country:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> And he was gone forth to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditate</a> in the field, the day being now well spent: and when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming afar off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> Rebecca also, when she saw <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, lighted off the camel,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And said to the servant: Who is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who cometh towards us along the field? And he said to her: That <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is my master. But she quickly took her cloak, and covered herself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And the servant told <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> all that he had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> Who brought her into the tent of <a href="../cathen/13468a.htm">Sara</a> his mother, and <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">took her to wife</a>: and he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> her so much, that it moderated the sorrow which was occasioned by his mother's death.</span></p>
