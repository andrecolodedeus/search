<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint. For which reason his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was called <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Edom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said to him: Sell me thy first birthright.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">Swear</a> therefore to me. <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to him, and sold his first birthright.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went on his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright.</span></p>
