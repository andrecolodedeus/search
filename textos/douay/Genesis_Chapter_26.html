<div class="h1a">Isaac sojourns in Gerara, where God renews to him the promise made to Abraham. King Abimelech makes league with him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which had happened in the days of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> went to Abimelech, king of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Palestines</a>, to Gerara.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to him, and said: Go not down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, but stay in the land that I shall tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thy father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and I will give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> of the earth be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Because <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> my voice, and kept my <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> and <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, and observed my <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">laws</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> abode in Gerara.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when he was asked by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that place, concerning his wife, he answered: She is my sister: for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him because of her beauty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when very many days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech, king of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Palestines</a>, looking out through a window, saw him playing with Rebecca, his wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And calling for him, he said: It is evident she is thy wife: why didst thou <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">feign</a> her to be thy sister? He answered: I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feared</a> lest I should die for her sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Abimelech said: Why hast thou <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceived</a> us? Some man of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a> might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And he commanded all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He that shall touch this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wife, shall surely be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">enriched</a>, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he had <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a> of sheep and of herds, and a very great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Palestines</a> <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envying</a> him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Stopped up at that time all the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">wells</a>, that the servants of his father, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, had digged, filling them up with earth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>: Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So he departed, and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he digged again other <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">wells</a>, which the servants of his father, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, had digged, and which, after his death, the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>, by which his father before had called them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they digged in the torrent, and found living water: <span class="stiki"><strong>Torrent...</strong> That is, a channel where sometimes a torrent or violent stream had run.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>, on occasion of that which had happened, <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">Calumny</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they digged also another; and for that they quarrelled likewise, and he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of it, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">Enmity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Going forward from thence, he digged another <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>, for which they contended not; therefore he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth. <span class="stiki"><strong>Latitude...</strong> That is, wideness, or room.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he went up from that place to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Where the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared to him that same night, saying: I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thy father, do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, for I am with thee: I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he built there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: and called upon the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and pitched his tent; and commanded his servants to dig a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of his soldiers, came from Gerara,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> said to them: Why are ye come to me, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, and have thrust out from you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they answered: We saw that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> between us, and let us make a covenant,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee away, increased with the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Arising in the morning, they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> one to another: and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> sent them away peaceably to their own home.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And behold, the same day the servants of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> came, telling him of a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> which they had digged, and saying: We have found water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the city was called <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>, even to this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> being forty years old, <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> wives, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of the same place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And they both offended the mind of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and Rebecca.</span></p>
