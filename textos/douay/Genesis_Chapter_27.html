<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> was old, and his eyes were dim, and he could not see: and he called <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, his elder son, and said to him: My son? And he answered: Here I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And his father said to him, Thou seest that I am old, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the day of my death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go abroad; and when thou hast taken something by hunting,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Make me a savoury meat thereof, as thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> I like, and bring it that I may eat: and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, before I die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when Rebecca had heard this, and he was gone into the field to fulfil his father's commandment,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> She said to her son <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: I heard thy father talking with <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, thy brother, and saying to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats that I may eat, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, before I die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now therefore, my son, follow my counsel:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And go thy way to the flock, bring me two kids of the best, that I may make of them meat for thy father, such as he gladly eateth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Which when thou hast brought in, and he hath eaten, he may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee before he die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he answered her: Thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> that <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, my brother, is a hairy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and I am smooth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> If my father should feel me, and perceive it, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest he will think I would have mocked him, and I shall bring upon me a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> instead of a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And his mother said to him: Upon me be this <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, my son: only hear thou my voice, and go, fetch me the things which I have said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He went, and brought, and gave them to his mother. She dressed meats, such as she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his father liked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And she put on him very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> garments of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, which she had at home with her:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the little skins of the kids she put about his hands, and covered the bare of his neck.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And she gave him the savoury meat, and delivered him bread that she had baked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Which when he had carried in, he said: My father? But he answered: I hear. Who art thou, my son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: I am <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, thy <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>: I have done as thou didst command me: arise, sit and eat of my venison, that thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> me. <span class="stiki"><strong>I am Esau thy firstborn...</strong> <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (L. Contra mendacium, c. 10), treating at large upon this place, excuseth <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> from a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, because this whole passage was <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a>, as relating to the preference which was afterwards to be given to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> before the carnal <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetic</a> light might understand. So far is certain, that the first birthright, both by <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">divine election</a> and by <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free</a> cession belonged to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: so that if there were any <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> in the case, it could be no more than an officious and venial one.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> said to his son: How couldst thou find it so quickly, my son? He answered: It was the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that what I sought came quickly in my way:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> said: Come hither, that I may feel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou be my son <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, or no.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He came near to his father, and when he had felt him, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> said: The voice indeed is the voice of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>; but the hands, are the hands of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him not, because his hairy hands made him like to the elder. Then <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He said: Art thou my son <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>? He answered: I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy hunting, my son, that my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee. And when they were brought, and he had eaten, he offered him wine also, which after he had drunk,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> He said to him: Come near me, and give me a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He came near, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him. And immediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of his garments, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> him, he said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> give thee of the dew of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and of the fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and wine.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And let peoples serve thee, and tribes <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and let thy mother's children bow down before thee. <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> be he that <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curseth</a> thee: and let him that <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesseth</a> thee be filled with <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> had scarce ended his words, when, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> being now gone out abroad, <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> came,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And brought in to his father meats, made of what he had taken in hunting, saying: Arise, my father, and eat of thy son's venison; that thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> said to him: Why! who art thou? He answered: I am thy <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn son</a>, <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> was struck with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and astonished exceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, said: Who is he then that even now brought me venison that he had taken, and I ate of all before thou camest? and I have <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him, and he shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> having heard his father's words, roared out with a great cry; and, being in a consternation, said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Bless</a> me also, my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he said: Thy brother came <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceitfully</a> and got thy <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But he said again: Rightly is his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> called <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>; for he hath supplanted me lo this second time: My birthright he took away before, and now this second time he hath stolen away my <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>. And again he said to his father: Hast thou not reserved me also a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>? <span class="stiki"><strong>Jacob...</strong> That is, a supplanter.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> answered: I have appointed him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants: I have established him with corn and wine, and after this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> said to him: Hast thou only one <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, father? I beseech thee <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> me also. And when he wept with a loud cry,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> being moved, said to him:</p>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> therefore always <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> wherewith his father had <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him; and he said in his heart: The days will come of the mourning for my father, and I will <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> my brother <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> These things were told to Rebecca: and she sent and called <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, her son, and said to him: Behold <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, thy brother, threateneth to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise and flee to <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>, my brother, to <a href="../cathen/03378b.htm">Haran</a>:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And Rebecca said to <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>: I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Heth</a>: if <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> take a wife of the stock of this land, I choose not to live.</span></p>
