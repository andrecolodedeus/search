<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, to the house of Bathuel, thy mother's father, and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>, thy uncle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God almighty</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, and make thee to increase and multiply thee: that thou mayst be a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And give the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to thee, and to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst possess the land of thy sojournment, which he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to thy grandfather.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> had sent him away, he took his journey and went to Mesopotamia of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>, the son of Bathuel, the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, brother to Rebecca, his mother.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Experiencing also, that his father was not well pleased with the daughters of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He went to <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">took to wife</a>, besides them he had before, Maheleth, the daughter of <a href="../cathen/08192a.htm">Ismael</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> son, the sister of Nabajoth.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when he was come to a certain place, and would rest in it after sunset, he took of the stones that lay there, and putting under his head, slept in the same place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">saw in his sleep</a> a ladder standing upon the earth, and the top thereof touching <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ascending and descending by it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> leaning upon the ladder saying to him: I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thy father, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>: The land, wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and thy seed, all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I will be thy keeper whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land: neither will I leave thee, till I shall have accomplished all that I have said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> awaked out of sleep, he said: Indeed the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is in this place, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And trembling, he said: How terrible is this place? this is no other but the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> arising in the morning, took the stone which he had laid under his head, and set it up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the city <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, which before was called Luza. <span class="stiki"><strong>Bethel...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> signifies the <em>house of God</em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, saying: If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be with me, and shall keep me in the way, by which I walk, and shall give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And I shall return prosperously to my father's house: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall be my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And this stone, which I have set up for a title, shall be called the <em>house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></em>: and of all things that thou shalt give to me, I will offer <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to thee.</span></p>
