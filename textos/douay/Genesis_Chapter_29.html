<div class="h1a">Jacob serves Laban seven years for Rachel: but is deceived with Leah: he afterwards marries Rachel. Leah bears him four sons.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> went on in his journey, and came into the east country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he saw a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> in the field, and three flocks of sheep lying by it: for the beasts were watered out of it, and the mouth thereof was closed with a great stone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the custom was, when all the sheep were gathered together, to roll away the stone, and after the sheep were watered, to put it on the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he said to the shepherds: Brethren, whence are you? They answered: Of <a href="../cathen/03378b.htm">Haran</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he asked them, saying: Know you <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>, the son of Nachor? They said: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say they: and behold, <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>, his daughter, cometh with his flock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: There is yet much day remaining, neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again: first give the sheep drink, and so lead them back to feed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle be gathered together, and we remove the stone from the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well's</a> mouth, that we may water the flocks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> They were yet speaking, and behold <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> came with her father's sheep; for she fed the flock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> saw her, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her to be his cousin german, and that they were the sheep of <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>, his uncle: he removed the stone wherewith the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> was closed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And having watered the flock, he <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> her: and lifting up his voice wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he told her that he was her father's brother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went in haste and told her father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Who, when he heard that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> his sister's son was come, ran forth to meet him: and embracing him, and heartily <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> him, brought him into his house. And when he had heard the causes of his journey,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the days of one month were expired,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He said to him: Because thou art my brother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell me what wages thou wilt have.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now he had two daughters, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the elder was Lia; and the younger was called <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But Lia was blear eyed: <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> was well favoured, and of a beautiful countenance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> being in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with her, said: I will serve thee seven years for <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>, thy younger daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> answered: It is better that I give her to thee than to another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; stay with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> served seven years for <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>: and they seemed but a few days, because of the greatness of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>: Give me my wife; for now the time is fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he, having invited a great number of his friends to the feast, made the <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And at night he brought in Lia, his daughter, to him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Giving his daughter a handmaid, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Zelpha. Now when <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> had gone in to her according to custom, when morning was come he saw it was Lia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he said to his father in law: What is it that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve thee for <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>? why hast thou <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceived</a> me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> answered: It is not the custom in this place, to give the younger in <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> first.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Make up the week of days of this match: and I will give thee her also, for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past, he <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> To whom her father gave Bala, for her servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And having at length obtained the <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> he wished for, he preferred the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the latter before the former, and served with him other seven years.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> seeing that he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> Lia, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And she conceived and bore a son, and called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saw my affliction: now my husband will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And again she conceived and bore a son, and said: Because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard that I was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>, he hath given this also to me: and she called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And she conceived the third time, and bore another son, and said: Now also my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and said: Now will I praise the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and for this she <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">called</a> him <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>. And she left bearing.</span></p>
