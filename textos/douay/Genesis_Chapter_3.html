<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">serpent</a> was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> had made. And he said to the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a>: Why hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a> answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> we do eat:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">serpent</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a>: No, you shall not die the death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a> saw that the tree was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">husband</a>, who did eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons. <span class="stiki"><strong>And the eyes, etc...</strong> Not that they were blind before, (for the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a> saw that the tree was fair to the eyes, <a href="../douay/gen003.htm#verse6">verse 6</a>.) nor yet that their eyes were opened to any more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but only to the unhappy experience of having lost the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of original <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and innocence, and incurred the dreadful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. From whence followed a shame of their being naked; which they minded not before; because being now stript of original <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, they quickly began to be subject to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">shameful rebellions of the flesh</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when they heard the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> walking in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> at the afternoon air, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">wife</a> hid themselves from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, amidst the trees of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> called <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, and said to him: Where art thou?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said: I heard thy voice in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>; and I was <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a>, because I was naked, and I hid myself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> said: The <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a>, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a>: Why hast thou done this?

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">serpent</a>:</p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I will put enmities between thee and the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">thy seed</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">her seed</a>: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel. <span class="stiki"><strong>She shall crush...</strong> <em>Ipsa</em>, the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a>; so divers of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">fathers</a> read this place, conformably to the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>: others read it <em>ipsum</em>, viz., the seed.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> To the <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">woman</a> also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">wife</a>, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou shouldst not eat, <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> is the earth in thy work: with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> made for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">wife</a> garments of skins, and clothed them.</span>
