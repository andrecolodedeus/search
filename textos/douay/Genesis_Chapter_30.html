<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with her, answered: Am I as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hath deprived thee of the fruit of thy womb?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But she said: I have here my servant Bala: go in unto her, that she may bear upon my knees, and I may have children by her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And she gave him Bala in <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>: who,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> When her husband had gone in unto her, conceived and bore a son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judged</a> for me, and hath heard my voice, giving me a son; and therefore she called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And again Bala conceived, and bore another,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Lia perceiving that she had left of bearing, gave Zelpha, her handmaid, to her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when she had conceived, and brought forth a son,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> She said: Happily. And therefore called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Zelpha also bore another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Lia said: This is for my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> will call me <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> going out in the time of the wheat harvest into the field, found mandrakes: which he brought to his mother Lia.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> She answered: Dost thou think it a small matter, that thou hast taken my husband from me, unless thou take also my son's mandrakes? <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> said: He shall sleep with thee this night, for thy son's mandrakes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> returned at even from the field, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou shalt come in unto me, because I have hired thee for my son's mandrakes.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> heard her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; and she conceived: and bore a fifth son:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given me a reward, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/08201a.htm">Issachar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Lia conceived again, and bore the sixth son,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath endowed me with a good dowry; this turn also my husband will be with me, because I have borne him six sons: and therefore she called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> After whom she bore a daughter, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Dina.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also remembering <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>, heard her, and opened her womb.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And she conceived, and bore a son, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath taken away my reproach.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Give me my wives, and my children, for whom I have served thee, that I may depart: thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> the service that I have rendered thee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> said to him: Let me find favour in thy sight: I have learned, by experience, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> me for thy sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But he answered: Thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> how I have served thee, and how great thy <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possession</a> hath been in my hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Thou <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">hadst but little</a> before I came to thee, and now thou art become <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> thee at my coming. It is reasonable, therefore, that I should now provide also for my own house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> said: What shall I give thee? But he said: I require nothing; but if thou wilt do what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Go round through all thy flocks, and separate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled; and all that is brown and spotted, and of divers colours, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall be my wages.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And my <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall answer for me tomorrow before thee, when the time of the bargain shall come; and all that is not of divers colours, and spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">accurse</a> me of theft.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> said: I like well what thou demandest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he separated the same day the she goats, and the sheep, and the he goats, and the rams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the flock of one colour, that is, of white and black fleece, he delivered into the hands of his sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he set the space of three days journey betwixt himself and his son in law, who fed the rest of his flock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> took green rods of poplar, and of almond, and of plane trees, and pulled them in part: so when the bark was taken off, in the parts that were pulled, there appeared whiteness: but the parts that were whole, remained green: and by this means the colour was divers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he put them in the troughs, where the water was poured out; that when the flocks should come to drink, they might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them might conceive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And it came to pass, that in the very heat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and speckled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> separated the flock, and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams; and all the white and the black were <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban's</a>, and the rest were <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a>, when the flocks were separated one from the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> So when the ewes went first to ram, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> put the rods in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they might conceive while they were looking upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> But when the later coming was, and the last conceiving, he did not put them. And those that were lateward, became <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban's</a>; and they of the first time, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">enriched</a> exceedingly, and he had many flocks, maidservants and menservants, camels and asses.</span></p>
