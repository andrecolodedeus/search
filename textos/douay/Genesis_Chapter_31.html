<div class="h1a">Jacob's departure: he is pursued and overtaken by Laban. They make a covenant.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But after that he had heard the words of the sons of <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> hath taken away all that was our father's, and being enriched by his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a> is become great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And perceiving also, that <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban's</a> countenance was not towards him as yesterday and the other day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Especially the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saying to him: Return into the land of thy fathers and to thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>, and I will be with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He sent, and called <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> and Lia into the field, where he fed the flocks,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And said to them: I see your father's countenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day: but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my father hath been with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have served your father to the uttermost of my power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Yea your father hath also overreached me, and hath changed my wages ten times: and yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not suffered him to hurt me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> If at any time, he said: The speckled shall be thy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled: but when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt take all the white one for thy wages: all the flocks brought forth white ones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath taken your father's <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>, and given it to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For after the time came of the ewes conceiving, I lifted up my eyes, and <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">saw in my sleep</a>, that the males which leaped upon the females were of divers colours, and spotted, and speckled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a> said to me <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">in my sleep</a>: <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>. And I answered: Here I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that all the males leaping upon the females, are of divers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have seen all that <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> hath done to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, where thou didst anoint the stone, and make a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to me. Now therefore arise, and go out of this land, and return into thy native country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> and Lia answered: Have we any thing left among the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods and inheritance</a> of our father's house?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Hath he not counted us as strangers, and sold us, and eaten up the price of us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath taken our father's riches, and delivered them to us, and to our children: wherefore, do all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath commanded thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> rose up, and having set his children and wives upon camels, went his way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he took all his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>, and flocks, and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, his father, to the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> was gone to shear his sheep, and <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> stole away her father's <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Her father's idols...</strong> By this it appears that <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> was an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolater</a>; and some of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">fathers</a> are of opinion that <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> stole away these idols to withdraw him from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, removing the occasion of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> would not confess to his father in law that he was flying away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when he was gone, together with all that belonged to him, and having passed the river, was going on towards mount Galaad,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> It was told <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> on the third day, that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days; and overtook him in the mount of Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he saw in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying to him: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> had pitched his tent in the mountain: and when he, with his brethren, had overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, my daughters as captives taken with the sword?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Why wouldst thou run away privately, and not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee on the way with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Thou hast not suffered me to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> my sons and daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and now indeed,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> It is in my power to return thee <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your father said to me yesterday: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and hadst a longing after thy father's house: why hast thou <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen away</a> my <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> answered: That I departed unknown to thee, it was for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest thou wouldst <a href="../cathen/01032b.htm">take away</a> thy daughters by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But, whereas, thou chargest me with <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>: with whomsoever thou shalt find thy <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a> before our brethren. Search, and if thou find any of thy things with me, take them away. Now when he said this, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> had <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> So <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> went into the tent of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and found them not. And when he was entered into <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel's</a> tent,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> She, in haste, hid the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> under the camel's furniture, and sat upon them: and when he had searched all the tent, and found nothing,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> She said: Let not my lord be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> that I cannot rise up before thee, because it has now happened to me according to the custom of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. So his careful search was in vain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, said in a chiding manner: For what <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">fault</a> of mine, and for what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">offence</a> on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And searched all my household <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">stuff</a>? What hast thou found of all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a> of thy house? lay it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did not eat:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Neither did I show thee that which the beast had torn; I made good all the damage: whatsoever was lost by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, thou didst exact it of me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Day and night was I parched with heat, and with frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters, and six for thy flocks: thou hast changed also my wages ten times.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Unless the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my father, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, had stood by me, peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> answered him: The daughters are mine, and the children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are mine: what can I do to my children, and grandchildren?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Come, therefore, let us enter into a league; that it may be for a testimony between me and thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> took a stone, and set it up for a title.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And he said to his brethren: Bring hither stones. And they, gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">called</a> it, <em>The witness heap</em>; and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, <em>The hillock of testimony</em>: each of them according to the propriety of his language.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> said: This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this day, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof was called Galaad, that is, <em>The witness heap</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> behold and <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judge</a> between us, when we shall be gone one from the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wives over them: none is witness of our speech but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is present and beholdeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And he said again to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: Behold this heap, and the stone which I have set up between me and thee,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and the stone, be they for a testimony, if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt pass beyond it thinking <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">harm</a> to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Nachor, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their father, <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judge</a> between us. And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his father <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And after he had offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the mountain, he called his brethren to eat bread. And when they had eaten, they lodged there:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> But <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> arose in the night, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> his sons and daughters, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them: and returned to his place.</span></p>
