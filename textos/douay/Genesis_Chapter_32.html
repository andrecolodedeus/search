<div class="h1a">Jacob's vision of angels; his message and presents to Esau; his wrestling with an angel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> also went on the journey he had begun: and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> met him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place Mahanaim, that is, <em>Camps</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he sent messengers before him to <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, his brother, to the land of Seir, to the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">country of Edom</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>: Thus saith thy brother <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: I have sojourned with <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a>, and have been with him until this day:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the messengers returned to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, saying: We came to <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a> that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Saying: If <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> come to one company, and destroy it, the other company that is left, shall escape.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my father <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> who saidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>; and now I return with two companies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Deliver me from the hand of my brother <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, for I am greatly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a> of him; lest perhaps he come, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> the mother with the children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten of their foals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Thou shalt answer: Thy servant <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a>: he hath sent them as a present to my lord <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>; and he cometh after us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> In like manner he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, when ye find him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And ye shall add: Thy servant <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> himself also followeth after us; for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And rising early, he took his two wives and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He remained alone; and behold, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wrestled with him till morning. <span class="stiki"><strong>A man, etc...</strong> This was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shape, as we learn from <a href="../douay/hos012.htm#verse4">Osee 12:4</a>. He is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, verses <a href="../douay/gen032.htm#verse28">28</a> and <a href="../douay/gen032.htm#verse30">30</a>, because he represented the person of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Son of God</a>. This wrestling, in which <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, assisted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was a match for an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, was so ordered (<a href="../douay/gen032.htm#verse28">verse 28</a>), that he might learn by this experiment of the divine assistance, that neither <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, nor any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, should have power to hurt him. -- It was also spiritual, as appeareth by his earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, urging and at last obtaining the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered: I will not let thee go, except thou <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he said: What is thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>? He answered: <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But he said: Thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> shall not be called Jacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how much more shalt thou prevail against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> asked him: Tell me by what <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>? And he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him in the same place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been saved. <span class="stiki"><strong>Phanuel...</strong> This word signifies the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the sight, or seeing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.</span></p>
