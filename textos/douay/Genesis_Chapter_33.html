<div class="h1a">Jacob and Esau meet: Jacob goes to Salem, where he raises an altar.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> lifting up his eyes, saw <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> coming, and with him four hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and he divided the children of Lia and of <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>, and of the two handmaids.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> last.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times, until his brother came near.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> ran to meet his brother, and embraced him: and clasping him fast about the neck, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> him, wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And lifting up his eyes, he saw the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and their children, and said: What mean these? And do they belong to thee? He answered: They are the children which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given to me, thy servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then the handmaids and their children came near and bowed themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Lia also, with her children, came near and bowed down in like manner; and last of all, <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> bowed down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> said: What are the droves that I met? He answered: That I might find favour before my lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: be gracious to me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And take the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> which I have brought thee, and which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given me, who giveth all things. He took it with much ado at his brother's earnest pressing him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And said: Let us go on together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: My lord, thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which if I should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> May it please my lord to go before his servant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> answered: I beseech thee, that some of the people, at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said: There is no necessity: I want nothing else but only to find favour, my lord, in thy sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> returned that day, the way that he came, to Seir.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> came to Socoth: where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the place Socoth, that is, <em>Tents</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he passed over to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Salem</a>, a city of the <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichemites</a>, which is in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, after he returned from Mesopotamia of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>: and he dwelt by the town.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he bought that part of the field, in which he pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, for a hundred lambs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And raising an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> there, he invoked upon it the most mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
