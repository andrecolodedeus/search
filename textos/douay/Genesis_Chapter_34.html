<h1>Genesis Chapter 34</h1>
<div class="h1a">Dina is ravished, for which the Sichemites are destroyed.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of that country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with her: and <a href="../cathen/01032b.htm">took her away</a>, and lay with her, ravishing the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was fast knit unto her; and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get me this damsel to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But when <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> had heard this, his sons being absent, and employed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they came back.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Behold his sons came from the field: and hearing what had passed, they were exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, because he had done a foul thing in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and committed an <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">unlawful act</a>, in ravishing <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Hemor spoke to them: The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of my son Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give her him to wife:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And let us contract <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriages</a> one with another: give us your daughters, and take you our daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And dwell with us: the land is at your command, till, trade, and possess it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren: Let me find favour in your sight, and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will gladly give what you shall demand: only give me this damsel to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The sons of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> answered Sichem and his father deceitfully, being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">enraged</a> at the deflowering of their sister: <span class="stiki"><strong>Deceitfully...</strong> The sons of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, on this occasion, were guilty of a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as well by <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">falsely pretending</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>, as by excess of revenge: though otherwise their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against so foul a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">crime</a> was commendable.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; which with us is unlawful and abominable.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But in this we may be allied with you, if you will be like us, and all the male sex among you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then will we mutually give and take your daughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you, and will be one people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But if you will not be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, we will take our daughter and depart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his son:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the young man made no delay, but forthwith fulfilled what was required: for he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the damsel exceedingly, and he was the greatest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in all his father's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And going into the gate of the city, they spoke to the people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> These <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are peaceable, and are willing to dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and till it, which being large and wide wanteth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to till it: we shall take their daughters for wives, and we will give them ours.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> One thing there is for which so great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is deferred: We must <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcise</a> every male among us, following the manner of the nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>, and cattle, and all that they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall make one people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they all agreed, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> all the males.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound was greatest: two of the sons of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a>, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city and slew all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their sister Dina out of Sichem's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when they were gone out, the other sons of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> came upon the slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they took their sheep, and their herds, and their asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in their fields.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And their children and wives they took <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">captive</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said to <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a>: You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a> and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land. We are few: they will gather themselves together and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me; and both I, and my house shall be destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> They answered: Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?</span></p>
