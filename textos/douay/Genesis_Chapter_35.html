<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the mean time <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: Arise and go up to <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and dwell there, and make there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who appeared to thee when thou didst flee from <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, thy brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> having called together all his household, said: Cast away the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a> that are among you, and be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">cleansed</a>, and change your garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Arise, and let us go up to <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, that we may make there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who heard me in the day of my affliction, and accompanied me in my journey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So they gave him all the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a> they had, and the earrings which were in their ears: and he buried them under the turpentine tree, that is behind the city of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when they were departed, the terror of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fell upon all the cities round about, and they durst not pursue after them as they went away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> came to Luza, which is in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, surnamed <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>: he and all the people that were with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he built there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place, <em>The house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></em>: for there <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to him when he fled from his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> At the same time Debora, the nurse of Rebecca, died, and was buried at the foot of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, under an oak, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place was called, <em>The oak of weeping</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appeared again to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, after he returned from Mesopotamia of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the land which I gave to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he departed from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But he set up a monument of stone, in the place where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had spoken to him: pouring drink <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> upon it, and pouring oil thereon:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And calling the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And going forth from thence, he came in the spring time to the land which leadeth to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Ephrata</a>: wherein when <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> was in travail,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> By reason of her hard labour, she began to be in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear not, for thou shalt have this son also.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> erected a pillar over her sepulchre: this is the pillar of <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel's</a> monument, to this day.</span>
