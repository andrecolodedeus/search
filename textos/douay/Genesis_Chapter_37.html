<div class="h1a">Joseph's dreams: he is sold by his brethren, and carried into Egypt.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> dwelt in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, wherein his father sojourned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And these are his <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>: <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father's wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">crime</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And his brethren seeing that he was <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by his father, more than all his sons, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him, and could not speak peaceably to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him the more. <span class="stiki"><strong>A dream...</strong> These <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dreams</a> of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> were <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetical</a>, and sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as were also those which he <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpreted</a>, <a href="../douay/gen040.htm">Genesis 40</a> and <a href="../douay/gen041.htm">41</a>; otherwise generally speaking, the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">observing of dreams</a> is condemned in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. See <a href="../douay/deu018.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>; <a href="../douay/sir034.htm#verse2">Ecclesiasticus 34:2-3</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said to them: Hear my <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> which I dreamed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about bowed down before my sheaf.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dreams</a> and words ministered nourishment to their <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He dreamed also another <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">worshipping</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when he had told this to his father, and brethren, his father rebuked him and said: What meaneth this <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> thee upon the earth? <span class="stiki"><strong>Worship...</strong> This word is not used here to signify <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">divine worship</a>, but an <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">inferior veneration</a>, expressed by the bowing of the body, and that, according to the manner of the eastern nations, down to the ground.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> His brethren therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envied</a> him: but his father considered the thing with himself.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when his brethren abode in <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sechem</a>, feeding their father's flocks,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a> said to him: Thy brethren feed the sheep in <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, he came to <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But he answered: I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed the flocks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Come, let us <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him, and cast him into some old pit: and we will say: Some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dreams</a> avail him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Do not take away his <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And cast him into an old pit where there was not water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Ismaelites</a> on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said to his brethren: What will it profit us to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> our brother, and conceal his blood?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> It is better that he be sold to the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Ismaelites</a>, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianite</a> merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Ismaelites</a>, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> returning to the pit, found not the boy:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear, and whither shall I go?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And tearing his garments, he put on <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, mourning for his son a long time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a>, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping, <span class="stiki"><strong>Into hell...</strong> That is, into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>, the place where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> were received before the death of our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>. For allowing that the word <em>hell</em> sometimes is taken for the grave, it cannot be so taken in this place; since <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> his son to be in the grave, (whom he supposed to be devoured by a wild beast), and therefore could not mean to go down to him thither: but certainly meant the place of rest where he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> The <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianites</a> sold <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to Putiphar, an eunuch of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the soldiers. <span class="stiki"><strong>An eunuch...</strong> This word sometimes signifies a chamberlain, courtier, or officer of the king: and so it is taken in this place.</span></span></p>
