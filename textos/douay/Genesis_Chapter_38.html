<div class="h1a">The sons of Judah: the death of Her and Onan: the birth of Phares and Zara.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain <a href="../cathen/01162a.htm">Odollamite</a>, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Hiras.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he saw there the daughter of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, called Sue: and <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">taking her to wife</a>, he went in unto her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And she conceived, and bore a son, and called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And conceiving again, she bore a son, and <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">called</a> him Onan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> She bore also a third: whom she called Sela. After whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> took a wife for Her, his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first born</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Thamar.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Her, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first born</a> of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and was slain by him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in to thy brother's wife and <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> her, that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the children should not be his, when he went in to his brother's wife, he spilled his seed upon the ground, lest children should be born in his brother's <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And therefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> slew him, because he did a detestable thing:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said to Thamar his daughter-in-law: Remain a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in thy father's house, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid lest he also might die, as his brethren did. She went her way, and dwelt in her father's house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And after many days were past: the daughter of Sue the wife of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> died: and when he had taken comfort after his mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hiras the <a href="../cathen/01162a.htm">Odollamite</a>, the shepherd of his flock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And it was told Thamar that her father-in-law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And she put off the garments of her <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>, and took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> When <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with thee: for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her not to be his daughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said: What wilt thou have for a pledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> therefore at one copulation conceived.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> sent a kid by his shepherd, the <a href="../cathen/01162a.htm">Odollamite</a>, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: but he, not finding her,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Asked the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that place: Where is the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that sat in the cross way? And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He returned to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said: Let her take it to herself, surely she cannot charge us with a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And behold, after three months, they told <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law, hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly. And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said: Bring her out that she may be burnt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But when she was led to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a>, she sent to her father in law, saying: By the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">juster</a> than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However he knew her no more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> This shall come forth the first.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Phares. <span class="stiki"><strong>Phares...</strong> That is, a breach or division.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread: and she called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Zara.</span></p>
