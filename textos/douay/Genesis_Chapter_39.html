<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with him, and he was a prosperous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in all things: and he dwelt in his master's house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> very well that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the house of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> for <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph's</a> sake, and multiplied all his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>, both at home and in the fields.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he any other thing, but the bread which he ate. And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And after many days, his mistress cast her eyes on <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, and said: Lie with me.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Neither is there any thing which is not in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife; how then can I do this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">wicked thing</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now it happened on a certain day, that <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> went into the house, and was doing some business, without any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> She called to her the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me; and when I cried out,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For a proof therefore of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">fidelity</a>, she kept the garment, and showed it to her husband when he returned home: <span class="stiki"><strong>A proof of her fidelity...</strong> or an argument to gain credit, <em>argumentum fidei</em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought, came to me to abuse me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I held, and fled out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife's words, was very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And cast <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king's</a> prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up.</span></p>
