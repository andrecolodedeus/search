<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And again she brought forth his brother <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a> was a shepherd, and <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> a husbandman.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And it came to pass after many days, that <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offered</a>, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But to <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> and his <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> he had no respect: and <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> was exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and his countenance fell.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a>: Where is thy brother <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a>?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now therefore <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face I shall be hid, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: every one therefore that findeth me, shall <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Every one that findeth me shall kill me...</strong> His guilty <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> made him <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> his own brothers and nephews; of whom, by this time, there might be a good number upon the earth; which had now endured near 130 years; as may be gathered from <a href="../douay/gen005.htm#verse3">Genesis 5:3</a>, compared with <a href="../douay/gen004.htm#verse25">Genesis 4:25</a>, though in the compendious account given in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>, only <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> and <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a> are mentioned.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: No, it shall not so be: but whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a>, shall be punished sevenfold. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> set a mark upon <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a>, that whosoever found him should not <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Set a mark, etc...</strong> The more common opinion of the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">interpreters</a> of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">holy writ</a> supposes this mark to have been a trembling of the body; or a horror and consternation in his countenance.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> went out from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the east side of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> thereof by the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his son Henoch. <span class="stiki"><strong>His wife...</strong> She was a daughter of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain's</a> own sister; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dispensing with such <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriages</a> in the beginning of the world, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> could not otherwise be propagated. <strong>He built a city, viz...</strong> In process of time, when his race was multiplied, so as to be numerous enough to people it. For in the many hundred years he lived, his race might be multiplied even to millions.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Who took two wives: the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the one was Ada, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the other Sella.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And his brother's <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Jubal: he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slain</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising. <span class="stiki"><strong>I have slain a man, etc...</strong> It is the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, that Lamech in hunting slew <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a>, mistaking him for a wild beast; and that having discovered what he had done, he beat so unmercifully the youth, by whom he was led into that mistake, that he died of the blows.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a>: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Seth, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given me another seed for <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slew</a>.</span>
