<div class="h1a">Joseph interprets the dreams of two of Pharao's servants in prison: the event declares the interpretations to be true, but Joseph is forgotten.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king of Egypt</a>, offended their lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them, (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He sent them to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of the commander of the soldiers, in which <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> also was prisoner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the keeper of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> delivered them to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, and he served them. Some little <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> passed, and they were kept in custody.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> agreeing to themselves:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> was come into them in the morning, and saw them sad,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He asked them, saying: Why is your countenance sadder today than usual?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpret</a> it to us. And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> said to them: Doth not <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Tell me what you have dreamed: <span class="stiki"><strong>Doth not interpretation belong to God?...</strong> When dreams are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as these were, the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> of them is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a>. But the generality of dreams are not of this sort; but either proceed from the natural complexions and dispositions of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or the roving of their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginations</a> in the day on such objects as they are much affected with, or from their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> being disturbed with cares and troubles, and oppressed with bodily infirmities: or they are suggested by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, to flatter, or to terrify weak <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, in order to gain <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and so draw them into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; or at least to trouble them in their sleep, whom they cannot move when they are awake: so that the general rule, with regard to dreams, is not to observe them, nor to give any credit to them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the cup of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> answered: This is the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation of the dream</a>: The three branches, are yet three days:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> After which <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou was wont to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Only remember me when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> in mind to take me out of this <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">dungeon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The chief baker seeing that he had wisely <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpreted the dream</a>, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> answered: This is the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation of the dream</a>: The three baskets, are yet three days:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> After which <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> will <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">take thy head</a> from thee, and hang thee on a <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The third day after this was the birthday of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he restored the one to his place, to present him the cup:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the interpreter might be shown.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter.</span></p>
