<h1>Genesis Chapter 41</h1>
<div class="h1a">Joseph interprets the two dreams of Pharao: he is made ruler over all Egypt.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After two years <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> had a dream. He thought he stood by the river,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Other seven also came up out of the river, ill favoured, and lean fleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned. So <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> awoke.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And devoured all the beauty of the former. <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> awaked after his rest:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpreters</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and to all the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpret</a> it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the soldiers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Forthwith at the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king's</a> command <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> was brought out of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and they shaved him: and changing his apparel brought him in to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">expound</a> them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise at <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpreting</a> them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> answered: Without me, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall give <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> a prosperous answer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank of the river,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And seven kine came up out of the river, exceeding beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they devoured and consumed the former,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill favoured as before. I awoke, and then fell asleep again,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stalk:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they devoured the beauty of the former: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that can <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">expound</a> it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> answered: The <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king's</a> dream is one: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath shown to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> what he is about to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Which shall be fulfilled in this order.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> After which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the land,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Now therefore let the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a> provide a wise and industrious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and make him ruler over the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up, under <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> hands, and be reserved in the cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> The counsel pleased <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and all his servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he said to them: Can we find such another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> He said therefore to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: Seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath shown thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And again <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And he took his <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a> from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bow their knee</a> before him, and that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> he was made governor over the whole land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: I am <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: without thy commandment no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall move hand or foot in all the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And he turned his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">called</a> him in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> tongue the saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife <a href="../cathen/01774c.htm">Aseneth</a>, the daughter of Putiphare, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Heliopolis. Then <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> went out to the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The saviour of the world...</strong> <em>Zaphnah paaneah</em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> (Now he was thirty years old when he stood before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king Pharao</a>), and he went round all the countries of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corn being bound up into sheaves, was gathered together into the barns of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And before the famine came, <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> had two sons born: whom <a href="../cathen/01774c.htm">Aseneth</a>, the daughter of Putiphare, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Heliopolis, bore unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father's house. <span class="stiki"><strong>Manasses...</strong> That is, oblivion, or forgetting.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And he <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> the second Ephraim, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made me to grow in the land of my <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poverty</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Ephraim...</strong> That is, fruitful, or growing.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were passed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> The seven years of scarcity, which <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> had foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, for food. And he said to them: Go to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: and do all that he shall say to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And the famine increased daily in all the land: and <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> opened all the barns, and sold to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>: for the famine had oppressed them also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And all provinces came into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want.</span></p>
