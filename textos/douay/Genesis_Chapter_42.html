<h1>Genesis Chapter 42</h1>
<div class="h1a">Jacob sends his ten sons to buy corn in Egypt. Their treatment by Joseph.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> hearing that food was sold in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, said to his sons: Why are ye careless?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I have heard that wheat is sold in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: Go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">want</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So the ten brethren of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> went down, to buy corn in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Whilst <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> was kept at home by <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they entered into the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with others that went to buy. For the famine was in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> was governor in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and corn was sold by his direction to the people. And when his brethren had bowed down to him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them, he spoke as it were to strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them: Whence came you? They answered: From the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, to buy necessaries of life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his brethren, he was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And remembering the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dreams</a>, which formerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of the land. <span class="stiki"><strong>You are spies...</strong> This he said by way of examining them, to see what they would answer.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But they said: It is not so, my lord; but thy servants are come to buy food.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> We are all the sons of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: we are come as peaceable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither do thy servants go about any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He saith, This is it that I said: You are spies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, till what you have said be proved, whether it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>: or else by the health of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> you are spies. <span class="stiki"><strong>Or else by the health of Pharao you are spies...</strong> That is, if these things you say be proved <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, you are to be held for spies for your <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a>, and shall be treated as such. <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> dealt in this manner with his brethren, to bring them by the means of affliction to a sense of their former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and a sincere repentance for it.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So he put them in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> three days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the third day he brought them out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> If you be peaceable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, let one of your brethren be bound in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>: and go ye your ways, and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and you may not die. They did as he had said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things, because we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against our brother, seeing the anguish of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the boy; and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> understood, because he spoke to them by an interpreter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning, he spoke to them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And taking <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>, and binding him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way: and they did so.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But they having loaded their asses with the corn went their way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack's mouth,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And said to his brethren: My money is given me again; behold it is in the sack. And they were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath done unto us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they came to <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> their father in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And we answered him: We are peaceable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and we mean no plot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he said to us: Hereby shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are peaceable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you are not spies: and you may receive this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> again, that is kept in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> When they had told this, they poured out their corn, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Their father <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said: You have made me to be without children: <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> is not living, <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a> is kept in bonds, and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> you will take away: all these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are fallen upon me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> answered him: <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">Kill</a> my two sons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>To hell...</strong> That is, to that place, where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> then remained, as <a href="../douay/gen037.htm#verse35">Genesis 37:35</a>.</span></span></p>
