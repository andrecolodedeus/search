<h1>Genesis Chapter 43</h1>
<div class="h1a">The sons of Jacob go again into Egypt with Benjamin. They are entertained by Joseph.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> said to his sons: Go again, and buy us a little food.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> answered: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> declared unto us with the attestation of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, saying: You shall not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying: You shall not see my face without your youngest brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a> said to them: You have done this for my misery, in that you told him you had also another brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But they answered: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> asked us in order concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we answered him regularly, according to what he demanded: could we know that he would say: Bring hither your brother with you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said to his father: Send the boy with me, that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our children perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against thee <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">for ever</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a> said to them: If it must needs be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down presents to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds. <span class="stiki"><strong>Balm...</strong> Literally rosin, <em>resinae</em>; but here by that <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is meant balm.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And take also your brother, and go to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And may my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">almighty God</a> make him favourable to you: and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>: and as for me I shall be desolate without children.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> took the presents, and double money, and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>: and went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and stood before <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when he had seen them, and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> into the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">noon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He did as he was commanded, and brought the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> into the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they being much <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a>, said there one to another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accusation, and by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> make <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">slaves</a> of us and our asses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Wherefore, going up to the steward of the house, at the door,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us. We came down once before to buy food:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when we had bought, and were come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have now brought again in the same weight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a> out to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed their feet</a>, and he gave provender to their asses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But they made ready the presents, against <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> came at <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">noon</a>: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> came in to his house, and they offered him the presents, holding them in their hands; and they bowed down with their face to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But he courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom you told me? Is he yet living?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they answered: Thy servant our father, is in health; he is yet living. And bowing themselves, they made obeisance to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> lifting up his eyes, saw <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, his brother by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be gracious to thee, my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he made haste, because his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: and going into his chamber, he wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when it was set on, for <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> apart, and for his brethren apart, for the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> also that ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> They sat before him, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, so that it exceeded by five parts. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span></p>
