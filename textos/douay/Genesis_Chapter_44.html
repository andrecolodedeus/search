<div class="h1a">Joseph's contrivance to stop his brethren. The humble supplication of Judah.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> commanded the steward of his house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold: and put the money of every one in the top of his sack.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way: <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> sending for the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The cup which you have <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a>, is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divine</a>: you have done a very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">heinous</a> a fact?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>: how then should it be that we should <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a> out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">die</a>, and we will be the <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondmen</a> of my lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">servant</a>, and you shall be blameless.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> opened his sack.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin's</a> sack.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> at the head of his brethren went in to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> (for he was not yet gone out of the place) and they all together fell down before him on the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divining</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The science of divining...</strong> He speaks of himself according to what he was esteemed in that kingdom. And indeed, he being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> more without comparison than any of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">sorcerers</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> to allege? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath found out the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of thy servants: behold, we are all <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondmen</a> to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> answered: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should do so: he that <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stole</a> the cup, he shall be my <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondman</a>: and go you away free to your father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> coming nearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears, and be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with thy servant: for after <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> thou art.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and his father <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> him tenderly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore me two.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him; and hitherto he appeareth not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>His gray hairs...</strong> That is, his person, now far advanced in years. <strong>With sorrow unto hell...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> word for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is here <em>sheol</em>, the Greek <em>hades</em>: it is not taken for the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell of the damned</a>; but for that <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">place of souls</a> below where the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were kept before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Which place, both in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">creed</a>, is named <em>hell</em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Let me be thy proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against my father <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">for ever</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.</span></p>
