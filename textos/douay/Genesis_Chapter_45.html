<div class="h1a">Joseph makes himself known to his brethren: and sends for his father.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by: whereupon he commanded that all should go out, and no stranger be present at their knowing one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, and all the house of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said to his brethren: I am <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: Is my father yet living? His brethren could not answer him, being struck with exceeding great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he said mildly to them: Come nearer to me. And when they were come near him, he said: I am <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, your brother, whom you sold into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Be not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a>, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent me before you into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> for your preservation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land, and five years more remain, wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reaping.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have food to live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: who hath made me as it were a father to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and lord of his whole house, and governor in all the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to him: Thus saith thy son <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made me lord of the whole land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; come down to me, linger not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen: and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, thy sheep, and thy herds, and all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> that thou hast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five years of famine remaining) lest both thou perish, and thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">house</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> that thou hast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, see that it is my mouth that speaketh to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> You shall tell my father of all my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and all things that you have seen in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: make haste and bring him to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And falling upon the neck of his brother <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, he embraced him and wept: and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> in like manner wept also on his neck.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> all his brethren, and wept upon every one of them: after which they were emboldened to speak to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And it was heard, and the fame was spread abroad in the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king's</a> <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>: The brethren of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> are come; and <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> with all his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">glad</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he spoke to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> that he should give orders to his brethren, saying: Load your beasts, and go into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And bring away from thence your father and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>, and come to me; and I will give you all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that you may eat the marrow of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, for the carriage of their children and their wives; and say: Take up your father, and make haste to come with all speed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And leave nothing of your <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">household stuff</a>; for all the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> shall be yours.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the sons of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a> did as they were bid. And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> gave them wagons according to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> commandment: and provisions for the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes: but to <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> he gave three hundred pieces of silver, with five robes of the best:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Sending to his father as much money and raiment; adding besides, ten he asses, to carry off all the riches of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and as many she asses, carrying wheat and bread for the journey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> So he sent away his brethren, and at their departing said to them: Be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they went up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and came into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, to their father <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they told him, saying: <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, thy son, is living; and he is ruler in all the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Which when <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> heard, he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep, yet did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> They, on the other side, told the whole order of the thing. And when he saw the wagons, and all that he had sent, his spirit revived,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he said: It is enough for me if <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, my son, be yet living: I will go and see him before I die.</span></p>
