<h1>Genesis Chapter 47</h1>
<div class="h1a">Jacob and his sons are presented before Pharao: he gives them the land of Gessen. The famine forces the Egyptians to sell all their possessions to the king.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> went in and told <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, saying: My father and brethren, their sheep and their herds, and all that they possess, are come out of the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>: and behold they stay in the land of Gessen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Five <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also, the last of his brethren, he presented before the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>The last...</strong> <em>Extremos</em>. Some interpret this word of the chiefest, and most rightly: but <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> seems rather to have chosen out such as had the meanest appearance, that <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> might not think of employing them at <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, with danger of their <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he asked them: What is your occupation? They answered: We, thy servants, are shepherds, both we and our fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants, the famine being very grievous in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>: and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a> therefore said to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is before thee: and make them dwell in the best place, and give them the land of Gessen. And if thou knowest that there are industrious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> among them, make them rulers over my cattle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> After this <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> brought in his father to the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a>, and presented him before him: and he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And being asked by him: How many are the days of the years of thy life?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He answered: The days of my <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are a hundred and thirty years, few, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and they are not come up to the days of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of my <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">fathers</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a>, he went out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> gave a possession to his father and his brethren in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the best place of the land, in Ramesses, as <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> had commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he nourished them, and all his father's house, allowing food to every one.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a famine had oppressed the land, more especially of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought, and brought it in to the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king's</a> treasure.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when the buyers wanted money, all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, saying: Give us bread: why should we die in thy presence, having now no money?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he answered them: Bring me your cattle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thine, both we and our lands: buy us to be the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king's</a> servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> bought all the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> selling his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>, because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> hands:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And all its people from one end of the borders of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, even to the other end thereof,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Except the land of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which had been given them by the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a>: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> said to the people: Behold, as you see, both you and your lands belong to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>; take seed and sow the fields,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a>; the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they answered: our <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> is in thy hand; only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">king</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> From that time unto this day, in the whole land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the fifth part is paid to the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">kings</a>, and it is become as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, except the land of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which was free from this covenant.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> So <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a> dwelt in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that is, in the land of Gessen, and possessed it; and grew, and was multiplied exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he lived in it seventeen years: and all the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh, he called his son <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, and said to him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt show me this kindness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not to bury me in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But I will sleep with my <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">fathers</a>, and thou shalt take me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors. And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> answered him: I will do what thou hast commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he said: <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">Swear</a> then to me. And as he was <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swearing</a>, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, turning to the bed's head. <span class="stiki"><strong>To the bed's head...</strong> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../douay/heb011.htm#verse21">Hebrews 11:21</a>, following the Greek translation of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, reads <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the top of his rod. Where note, that the same word in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, according to the different pointing of it, signifies both a bed and a rod. And to verify both these sentences, we must understand that <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> leaning on <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph's</a> rod <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>, turning towards the head of his bed: which <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a>, inasmuch as it was referred to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was an <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">absolute and sovereign worship</a>: but inasmuch as it was referred to the rod of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of the sceptre, that is, of the royal dignity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was only an <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">inferior and relative honour</a>.</span></span></p>
