<div class="h1a">Joseph visits his father in his sickness, who adopts his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim, and blesses them, preferring the younger before the elder.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things, it was told <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> that his father was sick; and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> and Ephraim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And it was told the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: Behold thy son <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> cometh to thee. And being strengthened, he sat on his bed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> was come in to him, he said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God almighty</a> <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to me at <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Luza</a>, which is in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And said: I will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possession</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> shall be reputed to me as <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> and <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of their brethren in their possessions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> died from me in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> in the very journey, and it was spring time: and I was going to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Ephrata</a>, and I buried her near the way of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Ephrata</a>, which by another <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is called <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He answered: They are my sons, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me, that I may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel's</a> eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> and embraced them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee; moreover <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath shown me thy seed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> had taken them from his father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that is, towards the left hand of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a>; but <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But he, stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger brother; and the left upon the head of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, who was the elder, changing his hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the sons of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, and said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose sight my fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> walked, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that feedeth me from my youth until this day:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that delivereth me from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> these boys: and let my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> be called upon them, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of my fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>; and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father's hand, he tried to lift it from Ephraim's head, and to remove it to the head of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father; for this is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, put thy right hand upon his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But he refusing, said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, my son, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: and this also shall become a people, and shall be multiplied; but his younger brother shall be greater than he; and his seed shall grow into nations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them at that time, saying: In thee shall <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Israel</a> be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, and it shall be said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>. And he set Ephraim before <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, his son: Behold I die, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of your fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a> with my sword and bow.</span></p>
