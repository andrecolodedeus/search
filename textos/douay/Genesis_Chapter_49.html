<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> called his sons, and said to them: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you the things that shall befall you in the last days.</span></p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Thou art poured out as water, grow thou not; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, and didst defile his couch. <span class="stiki"><strong>Grow thou not...</strong> This was not meant by way of a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> or imprecation; but by way of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> foretelling that the <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">tribe of Ruben</a> should not inherit the pre-eminences usually annexed to the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first birthright</a>, viz., the double portion, the being prince or lord over the other brethren, and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: of which the double portion was given to <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, the princely office to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a>.</span></span><br />
