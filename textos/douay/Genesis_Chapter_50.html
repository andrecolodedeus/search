<h1>Genesis Chapter 50</h1>
<div class="h1a">The mourning for Jacob, and his interment. Joseph's kindness towards his brethren. His death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> saw this, he fell upon his father's face, weeping and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And while they were fulfilling his commands, there passed forty days: for this was the manner with bodies that were embalmed, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> mourned for him seventy days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the time of the mourning being expired, <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> spoke to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>: If I have found favour in your sight, speak in the ears of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For my father made me <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to him, saying: Behold I die; thou shalt bury me in my <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">sepulchre</a> which I have digged for myself in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>. So I will go up and bury my father, and return.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> said to him: Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> house, and all the elders of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">house of Joseph</a> with his brethren, except their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in the land of Gessen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He had also in his train chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they came to the <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">threshing floor of Atad</a>, which is situated beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> saw this, they said: This is a great mourning to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place was called, <em>The mourning of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a></em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So the sons of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> did as he had commanded them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And carrying him into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, they buried him in the <a href="../cathen/09502a.htm">double cave</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had bought together with the field for a possession of a burying place, of Ephron, the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, over against Mambre.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> returned into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another: Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that we did to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before he died,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> That we should say thus much to thee from him: I beseech thee to forget the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of thy brethren, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> they practised against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of thy father this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And when <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a> heard this, he wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And his brethren came to him; and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">worshipping</a> prostrate on the ground, they said: We are thy servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> You thought <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against me: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> turned it into <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">people</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">Fear</a> not: I will feed you and your children. And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he dwelt in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with all his father's house; and lived a hundred and ten years. And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>. The children also of Machir, the sons of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, were born on <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph's</a> knees.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> After which he told his brethren: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he made them <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to him, saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will visit you, carry my <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">bones</a> with you out of this place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he died, being a hundred and ten years old. And being embalmed, he was laid in a coffin in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span></p>
