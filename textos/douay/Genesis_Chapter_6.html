<div class="h1a">Man's sin is the cause of the flood. Noah is commanded to build the ark.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seeing the daughters of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they were fair, took to themselves wives of all which they chose. <span class="stiki"><strong>The sons of God...</strong> The descendants of Seth and Enos are here called <em>sons of God</em> from their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a> and piety: whereas the ungodly <a href="../cathen/03143a.htm">race of Cain</a>, who by their carnal affections lay grovelling upon the earth, are called the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The unhappy consequence of the former <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marrying</a> with the latter, ought to be a warning to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to be very circumspect in their <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriages</a>; and not to suffer themselves to be determined in their choice by their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">carnal passion</a>, to the prejudice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: My <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> shall not remain in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">for ever</a>, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years. <span class="stiki"><strong>His days shall be, etc...</strong> The meaning is, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> days, which before the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">flood</a> were usually 900 years, should now be reduced to 120 years. Or rather, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would allow <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> this term of 120 years, for their <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a> and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, before he would send the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">deluge</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> went in to the daughters of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they brought forth children, these are the mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of old, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of renown. <span class="stiki"><strong>Giants...</strong> It is likely the generality of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">flood</a> were of a gigantic stature in comparison with what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> now are. But these here spoken of are called giants, as being not only tall in stature, but <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> and savage in their dispositions, and mere monsters of cruelty and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seeing that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at all times,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> It repented him that he had made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the earth. And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart, <span class="stiki"><strong>It repented him, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is unchangeable, is not capable of repentance, grief, or any other <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>. But these expressions are used to declare the enormity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which was so provoking as to determine their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> to destroy these his creatures, whom before he had so much favoured.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He said: I will destroy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whom I have <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, from the face of the earth, from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> These are the <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a> of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a>: <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> was a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>, he walked with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he begot three sons, <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Sem</a>, <a href="../cathen/03566b.htm">Cham</a>, and Japheth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the earth was corrupted before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was filled with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He said to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a>: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Make thee an <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a> of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And thus shalt thou make it. The length of the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a> shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. <span class="stiki"><strong>Three hundred cubits, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, according to the dimensions here set down, contained four hundred and fifty thousand square cubits; which was more than enough to contain all the kinds of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> creatures, with all necessary provisions: even supposing the cubits here spoken of to have been only a foot and a half each, which was the least king of cubits.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thou shalt make a window in the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a> thou shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Behold, I will bring the waters of a great <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">flood</a> upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">breath of life</a> under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And of every <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of a sort into the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and of every thing that creepeth on the earth according to its kind: two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.</span>
