<div class="h1a">The flood ceases. Noah goes out of the ark, and offers a sacrifice. God's covenant to him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> remembered <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> creatures, and all the cattle which were with him in the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The fountains also of the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">deep</a>, and the floodgates of <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">heaven</a>, were shut up, and the rain from <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">heaven</a> was restrained.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a> rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And after that forty days were passed, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> opening the window of the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, which he had made, sent forth a raven:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up upon the earth. <span class="stiki"><strong>Did not return...</strong> The raven did not return into the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>; but (as it may be gathered from the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>) went to and fro; sometimes going to the mountains, where it found carcasses to feed on: and other times returning, to rest upon the top of the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He sent forth also a <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But she not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And she came to him in the evening carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a>, which returned not any more unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Therefore in the six hundredth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> opening the covering of the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Go out of the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>, thou and thy wife, thy sons and the wives of thy sons with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> All <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increase and multiply upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> So <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And all <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds went out of the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> built an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>, offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Holocausts,...</strong> or whole burnt <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>. In which the whole victim was consumed by fire upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and no part was reserved for the use of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or people.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> the earth for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">thought</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> heart are prone to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">living</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as I have done. <span class="stiki"><strong>Smelled, etc...</strong> A figurative expression, denoting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was well pleased with the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which his servant <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offered</a>.</span></span>
