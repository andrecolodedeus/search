<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> a husbandman began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And drinking of the wine was made <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunk</a>, and was uncovered in his tent. <span class="stiki"><strong>Drunk...</strong> <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> by the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">fathers</a> was not guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in being <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">overcome by wine</a>: because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the strength of it.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/03566b.htm">Cham</a> the father of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> had seen, to wit, that his father's nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Sem</a> and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father's nakedness. <span class="stiki"><strong>Covered the nakedness...</strong> Thus, as <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> takes notice L. 35; Moral. c. 22, we ought to cover the nakedness, that is, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, of our spiritual <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and superiors.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He said: <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> be <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. <span class="stiki"><strong>Cursed be Chanaan...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curses</a>, as well as the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarchs</a>, were <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetical</a>: And this in particular is here recorded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, who were to possess the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>. But why should <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> be <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> for his father's faults? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a> answer, that he being then a boy, was the first that saw his grandfather's nakedness, and told his father <a href="../cathen/03566b.htm">Cham</a> of it; and joined with him in laughing at it: which drew upon him, rather than upon the rest of the children of <a href="../cathen/03566b.htm">Cham</a>, this <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetical</a> <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>.</span></span></p>
