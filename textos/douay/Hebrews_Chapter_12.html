<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And therefore we also having so great a cloud of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> over our head, laying aside every weight and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which surrounds us, let us run by patience to the fight proposed to us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Looking on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the author and finisher of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who, having <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> set before him, endured the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, despising the shame, and now sitteth on the right hand of the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself that you be not wearied, fainting in your <!--<a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">-->minds<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For you have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And you have forgotten the consolation which speaketh to you, as unto children, saying: My son, neglect not the <!--<a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">-->discipline<!--</a>--> of the <!--<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->: neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For whom the <!--<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> he chastiseth: and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Persevere under <!--<a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">-->discipline<!--</a>-->. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dealeth with you as with his <!--<a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">-->sons<!--</a>-->. For what son is there whom the father doth not correct?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are made <!--<a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">-->partakers<!--</a>-->, then are you <!--<a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">-->bastards<!--</a>--> and not <!--<a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">-->sons<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Moreover, we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and we reverenced them. Shall we not much more <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> of <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirits<!--</a>--> and live?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they indeed for a few days, according to their own pleasure, instructed us: but he, for our profit, that we might receive his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctification</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but sorrow: but afterwards it will yield to them that are exercised by it the most peaceable fruit of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wherefore, lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble <!--<a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">-->knees<!--</a>-->:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And make straight steps with your feet: that no one, halting, may go out of the way; but rather be healed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>: without which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Looking diligently, lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be wanting to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: lest any root of bitterness springing up do hinder and by it many be defiled:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Lest there be any fornicator or <!--<a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">-->profane<!--</a>--> person, as <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> who for one mess sold his first birthright.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the <!--<a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">-->benediction<!--</a>-->, he was rejected. For he found no place of <!--<a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">-->repentance<!--</a>-->, although with tears he had sought it. <span class="stiki"><strong>He found, etc...</strong> That is, he found no way to bring his father to <!--<a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">-->repent<!--</a>-->, or change his <!--<a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">-->mind<!--</a>-->, with relation to his having given the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> to his younger brother <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For you are not come to a mountain that might be touched and a burning fire and a whirlwind and darkness and storm,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, which they that had excused themselves, that the word might not be spoken to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For they did not endure that which was said: and if so much as a beast shall touch the mount, it shall be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And so terrible was that which was seen, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: I am <!--<a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">-->frighted<!--</a>-->, and tremble.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But you are come to mount Sion and to the city of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and to the company of many thousands of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And to the <!--<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">-->church<!--</a>--> of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> who are written in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <!--<a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> of all, and to the <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirits<!--</a>--> of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> made <!--<a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">-->perfect<!--</a>-->,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <!--<a href="../cathen/10118a.htm">-->mediator<!--</a>--> of the new testament, and to the sprinkling of blood which speaketh better than that of <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> See that you refuse him not that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke upon earth, much more shall not we that turn away from him that speaketh to us from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Whose voice then moved the earth; but now he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promiseth</a>, saying: Yet once more: and I will move, not only the earth, but <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And in that he saith: Yet once more, he signifieth the translation of the moveable things as made, that those things may remain which are immoveable.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Therefore, receiving an immoveable <!--<a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">-->kingdom<!--</a>-->, we have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: whereby let us serve, pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with <!--<a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">-->fear<!--</a>--> and <!--<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">-->reverence<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a consuming fire.</span></p>
