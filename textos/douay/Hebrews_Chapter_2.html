<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard lest perhaps we should let them slip.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For if the word spoken by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> became steadfast and every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">transgression</a> and disobedience received a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> recompense of reward:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> How shall we escape if we neglect so great <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Which, having begun to be declared by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also bearing them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a> and divers <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and distributions of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to his own will.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not subjected unto <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the world to come, whereof we speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that thou art mindful of him? Or the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, that thou visitest him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Thou hast made him a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: thou hast crowned him with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and hast set him over the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of thy hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But we see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who was made a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for the suffering of death, crowned with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: that, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he might taste death for all.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to perfect the author of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Perfect by his passion...</strong> By suffering, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to enter into his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> [<a href="../douay/luk024.htm#verse26">Luke 24:26</a>] which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> here calls being made <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For both he that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctifieth</a> and they who are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I will declare thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> to my brethren: in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> will I praise thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And might deliver them, who through the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For nowhere doth he take hold of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: but of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> he taketh hold. <span class="stiki"><strong>No where doth he, etc...</strong> That is, he never took upon him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but that of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Wherefore, it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he might be a propitiation for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> he is able to succour them also that are <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a>.</span></p>
