<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Who is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> to him that made him, as was also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in all his house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was counted worthy of greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> than <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, by so much as he that hath built the house hath greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> than the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For every house is built by some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but he that <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> indeed was <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Wherefore, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> saith: To-day if you shall hear his voice,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Where your fathers <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> me, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and saw my <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">works</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, and I said: They always <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in heart.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> As I have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: If they shall enter into my rest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart of unbelief, to depart from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For we are made partakers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And with whom was he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">offended</a> forty years? Was it not with them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, whose carcasses were overthrown in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And to whom did he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.</span></p>
