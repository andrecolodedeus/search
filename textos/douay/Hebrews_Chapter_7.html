<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> To whom also <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> divided the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all: who first indeed by interpretation is king of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and then also king of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Salem</a>, that is, king of peace:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Without father, without mother, without <!--<a href="../cathen/06408a.htm">-->genealogy<!--</a>-->, having neither beginning of days nor end of <!--<a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">-->life<!--</a>-->, but likened unto the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, continueth a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever. <span class="stiki"><strong>Without father, etc...</strong> Not that he had no father, etc., but that neither his father, nor his pedigree, nor his birth, nor his death, are set down in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now consider how great this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is, to whom also <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarch</a> gave <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> out of the principal things.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him that had the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For it is evident that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> sprung out of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: in which <!--<a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">-->tribe<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke nothing concerning <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> There is indeed a setting aside of the former <!--<a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">-->commandment<!--</a>-->, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And inasmuch as it is not without an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (for the others indeed were made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> without an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>:</span>

Also, that no one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <!--<a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, nor all of them together, could <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offer<!--</a>--> that absolute <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of everlasting <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, which our one <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offered<!--</a>--> once, and for ever.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For it was fitting that we should have such a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>:</span>
