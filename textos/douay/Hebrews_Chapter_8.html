<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> If then he were on earth, he would not be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: seeing that there would be others to <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offer<!--</a>--> gifts according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>If then he were on earth, etc...</strong> That is, if he were not of a higher condition than the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levitical</a> order of earthly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and had not another kind of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offer<!--</a>-->, he should be excluded by them from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and its functions, which by the <!--<a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> were appropriated to their <!--<a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">-->tribe<!--</a>-->.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For this is the testament which I will make to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> after those days, saith the <!--<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->: I will give my <!--<a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">-->laws<!--</a>--> into their <!--<a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">-->mind<!--</a>-->: and in their heart will I write them.
