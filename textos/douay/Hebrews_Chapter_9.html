<div class="h1a">The sacrifices of the law were far inferior to that of Christ.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The former indeed had also <!--<a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">-->justifications<!--</a>--> of <!--<a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">-->divine<!--</a>--> service and a sanctuary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For there was a <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> made the first, wherein were the <!--<a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">-->candlesticks<!--</a>--> and the table and the setting forth of <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">loaves</a>, which is called the <!--<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">-->Holy<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And after the second veil, the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> which is called the Holy of Holies:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Having a golden <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the testament</a> covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> and the rod of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> that had blossomed and the tables of the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">testament</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And over it were the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubims</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now these things being thus ordered, into the first <!--<a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">-->tabernacle<!--</a>-->, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But into the second, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> alone, once a year: not without blood, which he <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offereth<!--</a>--> for his own and the people's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> signifying this: That the way into the Holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> was yet standing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Which is a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the <!--<a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">-->time<!--</a>--> present: according to which gifts and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offered<!--</a>-->, which cannot, as to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, make him <!--<a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">-->perfect<!--</a>--> that serveth, only in meats and in drinks,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And divers washings and <!--<a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">-->justices<!--</a>--> of the flesh laid on them until the <!--<a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">-->time<!--</a>--> of correction. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of correction...</strong> Viz., when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> should correct and settle all things.</span></span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Neither by the blood of goats or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the Holies, having obtained <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Eternal redemption...</strong> By that one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of his blood, once <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offered<!--</a>--> on the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ our Lord</a> paid and exhibited, once for all, the general price and ransom of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>: which no other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could do.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer, being sprinkled, <!--<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">-->sanctify<!--</a>--> such as are defiled, to the <!--<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">-->cleansing<!--</a>--> of the flesh:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> How much more shall the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offered<!--</a>--> himself unspotted unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">-->cleanse<!--</a>--> our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from dead <!--<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">-->works<!--</a>-->, to serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And therefore he is the <!--<a href="../cathen/10118a.htm">-->mediator<!--</a>--> of the new testament: that by means of his death for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of those <!--<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">-->transgressions<!--</a>--> which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For where there is a testament the death of the testator must of <!--<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">-->necessity<!--</a>--> come in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For a testament is of force after <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Whereupon neither was the first indeed <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> without blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For when every <!--<a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">-->commandment<!--</a>--> of the <!--<a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> had been read by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a>, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Saying: This is the blood of the testament which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath enjoined unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> also and all the vessels of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And almost all things, according to the <!--<a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, are <!--<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">-->cleansed<!--</a>--> with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> It is <!--<a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">-->necessary<!--</a>--> therefore that the patterns of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> things should be <!--<a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">-->cleansed<!--</a>--> with these: but the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> things themselves with better <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> than these.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is not entered into the Holies made with hands, the patterns of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: but into <!--<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">-->Heaven<!--</a>--> itself, that he may appear now in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Nor yet that he should <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offer<!--</a>--> himself often, as the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> entereth into the Holies every year with the blood of others: <span class="stiki"><strong>Offer himself often...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall never more <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offer<!--</a>--> himself in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, in that <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>, painful, and bloody manner, nor can there be any occasion for it: since by that one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, he has furnished the full ransom, <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, and remedy for all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world. But this hinders not that he may <!--<a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">-->offer<!--</a>--> himself daily in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacred mysteries</a> in an unbloody manner, for the daily application of that one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And as it is appointed unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> once to die, and after this the <!--<a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->:</span>
