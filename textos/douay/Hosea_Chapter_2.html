<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And she did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I gave her corn, and <!--<a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">-->wine<!--</a>-->, and oil, and multiplied her silver, and gold, which they have used in the service of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I will destroy her vines, and her fig trees, of which she said: These are my rewards, which my lovers have given me: and I will make her as a forest and the beasts of the field shall devour her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I will visit upon her the days of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>, to whom she burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and decked herself out with her earrings, and with her <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">jewels</a>, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I will give her vinedressers out of the same place, and the <a href="../cathen/01103a.htm">valley of Achor</a> for an opening of <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>: and she shall sing there according to the days of her youth, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span><br />
