<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The day of our king, the princes began to be <!--<a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">-->mad with wine<!--</a>-->: he stretched out his hand with scorners.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Because they have applied their heart like an oven, when he laid snares for them: he slept all the night baking them, in the morning he himself was heated as a flaming fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They were all heated like an oven, and have devoured their judges: all their kings have fallen: there is none amongst them that calleth unto me.</span><br />
