He was, according to the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, of the blood royal of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and after a most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, ended his days by a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">-->martyrdom<!--</a>-->; being sawed in two, at the command of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> son in law, <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">King Manasses</a>, for reproving his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">ISAIAS</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)
