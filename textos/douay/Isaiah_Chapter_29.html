<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I will make a trench about Ariel, and it shall be in sorrow and mourning, and it shall be to me as Ariel.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I will make a circle round about thee, and I will cast up a rampart against thee, and raise up bulwarks to besiege thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Thou shalt be brought down, thou shall speak out of the earth, and thy speech shall be heard out of the ground: and thy voice shall be from the earth like that of the python, and out of the earth thy speech shall mutter.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the multitude of them that fan thee, shall be like small dust: and as ashes passing away, the multitude of them that have prevailed against thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And it shall be at an instant suddenly.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the multitude of all <!--<a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">-->nations<!--</a>--> that have fought against Ariel, shall be as the dream of a vision by night, and all that have fought, and besieged and prevailed against it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And as he that is hungry dreameth, and eateth, but when he is awake, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is empty: and as he that is thirsty dreameth, and drinketh and after he is awake, is yet faint with thirst, and his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is empty: so shall be the multitude of all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that have fought against mount Sion.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the book shall be given to one that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> no <!--<a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">-->letters<!--</a>-->, and it shall be said to him: Read: and he shall answer: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no <!--<a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">-->letters<!--</a>-->.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> This thought of yours is perverse: as if the clay should think against the potter, and the work should say to the maker thereof: Thou madest me not: or the thing framed should say to him that fashioned it: Thou understandest not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Is it not yet a very little while, and <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a> shall be turned into charmel, and charmel shall be esteemed as a forest? <span class="stiki"><strong>Charmel...</strong> This word signifies a fruitful field.</span></span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Jacob</a>, he that <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a> shall not now be confounded, neither shall his countenance now be ashamed:</span><br />
