Then shall the spoils of much prey be divided: the lame shall take the spoil. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thy tacklings...</strong> He speaks of the enemies of the church, under the allegory of a ship that is disabled.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Neither shall he that is near, say: I am feeble. The people that dwell therein, shall have their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> taken away from them.</span></blockquote>
