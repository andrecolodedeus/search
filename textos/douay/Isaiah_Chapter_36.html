<h1>Isaiah Chapter 36</h1>
<div class="h1a">Sennacherib invades Judah: his blasphemies.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">king Ezechias</a>, that Sennacherib king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> came up against all the fenced cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and took them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> sent Rabsaces from Lachis to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">king Ezechias</a> with a great army, and he stood by the conduit of the upper <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a> in the way of the fuller's field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And there went out to him Eliacim the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and Joahe the son of Asaph the recorder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Rabsaces said to them: Tell <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>: Thus saith the great king, the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>: What is this confidence wherein thou trustest?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Or with what counsel or strength dost thou prepare for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? on whom dost thou trust, that thou art revolted from me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Lo thou trustest upon this broken staff of a reed, upon <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: upon which if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to all that trust in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But if thou wilt answer me: We trust in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>: is it not he whose high places and <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> hath taken away, and hath said to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: You shall worship before this <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And now deliver thyself up to my lord the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and I will give thee two thousand horses, and thou wilt not be able on thy part to find riders for them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And how wilt thou stand against the face of the judge of one place, of the least of my master's servants? But if thou trust in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in chariots and in horsemen:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And am I now come up without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> against this land to destroy it? The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Go up against this land, and destroy it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And Eliacim, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces: Speak to thy servants in the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> tongue: for we understand it: speak not to us in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Jews' language</a> in the hearing of the people, that are upon the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Rabsaces said to them: Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee, to speak all these words; and not rather to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that sit on the wall; that they may eat their own dung, and drink their urine with you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a loud voice in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Jews' language</a>, and said: Hear the words of the great king, the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Thus saith the king: Let not <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And let not <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> make you trust in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hands of the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Do not hearken to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a>: for thus said the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>: Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come out to me, and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the water of his <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cistern</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Till I come and take you away to a land, like to your own, a land of corn and of wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Neither let <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> trouble you, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the hand of the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Where is the god of Emath and of Arphad? where is the god of Sepharvaim? have they delivered <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> out of my hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Who is there among all the gods of these lands, that hath delivered his country out of my hand, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may deliver <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> out of my hand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they held their peace, and answered him not a word. For the king had commanded, saying: Answer him not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And Eliacim the son of Helcias, that was over the house, and Sobna the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and Joahe the son of Asaph the recorder, went in to <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces.</span></p>
