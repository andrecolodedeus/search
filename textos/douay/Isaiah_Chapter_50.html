<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Because I came, and there was not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: I called, and there was none that would hear. Is my hand shortened and become little, that I cannot <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a>? or is there no strength in me to deliver? Behold at my rebuke I will make the sea a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, I will turn the rivers into dry land: the fishes shall rot for want of water, and shall die for thirst.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> I will clothe the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> with darkness, and will make <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a> their covering.</span></blockquote>
