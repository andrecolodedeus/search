<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he shall grow up as a tender plant before him, and as a root out of a thirsty ground: there is no beauty in him, nor comeliness: and we have seen him, and there was no sightliness, that we should be desirous of him:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Despised, and the most abject of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of sorrows, and acquainted with infirmity: and his look was as it were hidden and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>, whereupon we esteemed him not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Surely he hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows: and we have thought him as it were a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, and as one struck by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and afflicted.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But he was wounded for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, he was bruised for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his bruises we are healed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> All we like sheep have gone astray, every one hath turned aside into his own way: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath laid on him the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of us all.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He was offered because it was his own <!--<a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">-->will<!--</a>-->, and he opened not his mouth: he shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and shall be dumb as a lamb before his shearer, and he shall not open his mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He was taken away from distress, and from <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->: who shall declare his <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>? because he is cut off out of the land of the living: for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of my people have I struck him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he shall give the ungodly for his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->burial<!--</a>-->, and the rich for his death: because he hath done no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, neither was there <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a> in his mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was pleased to bruise him in infirmity: if he shall lay down his life for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he shall see a longlived seed, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall be prosperous in his hand.</span><br />
