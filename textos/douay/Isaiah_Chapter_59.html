<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> have divided between you and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have hid his face from you that he should not hear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>: your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue uttereth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> There is none that calleth upon <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, neither is there any one that <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgeth<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>: but they trust in a mere nothing, and speak vanities: they have conceived labour, and brought forth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> They have broken the eggs of asps, and have woven the webs of spiders: he that shall eat of their eggs, shall die: and that which is brought out, shall be hatched into a basilisk.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Their webs shall not be for clothing, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are unprofitable works, and the work of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> is in their hands.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Their feet run to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are unprofitable thoughts: wasting and destruction are in their ways.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of peace, and there is no <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> in their steps: their paths are become crooked to them, every one that treadeth in them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> no peace.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Therefore is <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> far from us, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall not overtake us.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> We have groped for the wall, and like the blind we have groped as if we had no eyes: we have stumbled at noonday as in darkness, we are in dark places, as dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> hath been forgotten: and he that departed from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, lay open to be a prey: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saw, and it appeared <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his eyes, because there is no <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he saw that there is not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and he stood astonished, because there is none to oppose himself: and his own arm brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to him, and his own <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> supported him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He put on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as a breastplate, and a helmet of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> upon his head: he put on the garments of vengeance, and was clad with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as with a cloak.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> As unto revenge, as it were to repay <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to his adversaries, and a reward to his enemies: he will repay the like to the islands.</span><br />
