I said: Behold me, behold me, to a nation that did not call upon my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I have spread forth my hands all the day to an unbelieving people, who walk in a way that is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> after their own thoughts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> A people that continually provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> before my face, that immolate in gardens, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> upon bricks.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> That dwell in sepulchres, and sleep in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: that eat swine's flesh, and profane broth is in their vessels.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> That say: Depart from me, come not near me, because thou art <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: these shall be smoke in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, a fire burning all the day.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Behold it is written before me: I will not be silent, but I will render and repay into their bosom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> of your fathers together, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> upon the mountains, and have reproached me upon the hills; and I will measure back their first work in their bosom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: As if a grain be found in a cluster, and it be said: Destroy it not, because it is a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>: so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I may not destroy the whole.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I will bring forth a seed out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and out of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> a possessor of my mountains: and my <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And you, that have forsaken the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that have forgotten my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mount, that set a table for <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm#IV">fortune</a>, and offer libations upon it,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I will number you in the sword, and you shall all fall by slaughter: because I called and you did not answer: I spoke, and you did not hear: and you did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in my eyes, and you have chosen the things that displease me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: Behold my servants shall eat, and you shall be hungry: behold my servants shall drink, and you shall be thirsty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Behold my servants shall rejoice, and you shall be confounded: behold my servants shall praise for joyfulness of heart, and you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for grief of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And you shall leave your <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> for an execration to my <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> shall slay thee, and call his servants by another <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For behold I create new <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and a new earth: and the former things shall not be in remembrance, and they shall not come upon the heart.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But you shall be glad and rejoice for ever in these things, which I create: for behold I create <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a rejoicing, and the people thereof <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I will rejoice in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in my people, and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> There shall no more be an infant of days there, nor an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall not fill up his days: for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">accursed</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of my people, and the works of their hands shall be of long continuance.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> My <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth in trouble; for they are the seed of the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and their posterity with them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will hear; as they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together; the lion and the ox shall eat straw; and dust shall be the serpent's food: they shall not hurt nor kill in all my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></blockquote>
