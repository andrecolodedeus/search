<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against the last days.</span>
