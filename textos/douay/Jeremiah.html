<h1>Jeremiah</h1>

<p>Jeremiah was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a native of <a href="../cathen/01457a.htm">Anathoth</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> city in the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>: and was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> from his mother's womb, to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which office he began to execute when he was yet a child in age. He was in his whole life, according to the signification of his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, <em>Great before the Lord</em>; and a special <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> he underwent for discharging his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>; in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> for his persecutors; and in the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> death he suffered at their hands: it being an ancient tradition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, that he was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a> by the remnant of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who had retired into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">JEREMIAS</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)
