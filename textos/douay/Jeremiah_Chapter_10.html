<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Hear ye the word which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken concerning you, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Learn not according to the ways of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and be not afraid of the signs of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> fear:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->laws<!--</a>--> of the people are vain: for the works of the hand of the workman hath cut a tree out of the forest with an axe.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He hath decked it with silver and gold: he hath put it together with nails and hammers, that it may not fall asunder.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> They are framed after the likeness of a palm tree, and shall not speak: they must be carried to be removed, because they cannot go. Therefore fear them not, for they can neither do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> There is none like to thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: thou art great, and great is thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> in might.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Who shall not fear thee, O king of nations? for thine is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: among all the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They shall be all proved together to be senseless and foolish: the doctrine of their vanity is wood.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the coppersmith: violet and purple is their clothing: all these things are the work of artificers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: he is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, and the everlasting king: at his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from among those places that are under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is become a fool for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, every artist is confounded in his graven <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a>: for what he hath cast is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and there is no spirit in them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> They are vain things, and a ridiculous work: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The portion of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a> is not like these: for it is he who formed all things: and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is the rod of his inheritance: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> is his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest in a siege.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For thus saith he <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold I will cast away far off the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them, so that they may be found.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous. But I said: Truly this is my own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and I will bear it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not sought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: therefore have they not understood, and all their flock is <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out of the land of the north: to make the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and a dwelling for dragons.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that the way of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not his: neither is it in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to walk, and to direct his steps. <span class="stiki"><strong>The way of a man is not his...</strong> The meaning is, that notwithstanding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, yet he can do no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help, nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> without his permission. So that, in the present case, all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> was about to bring upon <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, could not have come but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Correct me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but yet with <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->: and not in thy fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: because they have eaten up <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have destroyed his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span></blockquote>
