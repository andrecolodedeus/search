<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The word that came from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to Jeremias, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, and to the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall not hearken to the words of this covenant,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from the iron furnace, saying: Hear ye my voice, and do all things that I command you: and you shall be my people, and I will be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> That I may accomplish the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Proclaim aloud all these words in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying: Hear ye the words of the covenant, and do them:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For protesting I conjured your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> even to this day: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> early I conjured them, and said: Hearken ye to my voice:</span><br />

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me:</p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They are returned to the former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> of their fathers, who refused to hear my words: so these likewise have gone after strange gods, to serve them: the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a> have made void my covenant, which I made with their fathers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Wherefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold I will bring in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon them, which they shall not be able to escape: and they shall cry to me, and I will not hearken to them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> shall go, and cry to the gods to whom they offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and they shall not save them in the time of their affliction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and according to the number of the streets of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> thou hast set up <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> of confusion, <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a> to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Therefore do not thou <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for this people, and do not take up praise and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for them: for I will not hear them in the time of their cry to me, in the time of their affliction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in my house? shall the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> flesh take away from thee thy crimes, in which thou hast boasted?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> called thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, a plentiful olive tree, fair, fruitful, and beautiful: at the noise of a word, a great fire was kindled in it, and the branches thereof are burnt.</span><br />

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, hast shown me, and I have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: then thou showedst me their doings.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim: and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that they had devised counsels against me, saying: Let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> be remembered no more.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a>, who judgest <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and triest the reins and the hearts, let me see thy revenge on them: for to thee have I revealed my cause. <span class="stiki"><strong>Sabaoth...</strong> That is, of hosts or armies, a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> frequently given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>. -- Ibid. <strong>Thy revenge...</strong> This was rather a prediction of what was to happen, with an approbation of the divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, than an imprecation.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/01457a.htm">Anathoth</a>, who seek thy life, and say: Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and thou shalt not die in our hands.</span><br />
