<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they prosper and bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, hast <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, thou hast seen me, and proved my heart with thee: gather them together as for the day of slaughter.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of them that dwell therein?

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> If thou hast been wearied with running with footmen, how canst thou contend with horses? and if thou hast been secure in a land of peace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full voice: <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them not when they speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to thee.</span></blockquote>
