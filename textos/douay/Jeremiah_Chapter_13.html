<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to me: Go, and get thee a linen girdle, and thou shalt put it about thy loins, and shalt not put it into water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I got a girdle according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, and put it about my loins.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me the second time, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Take the girdle which thou hast got, which is about thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And it came to pass after many days, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from thence the girdle, which I commanded thee to hide there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle out of the place where I had hid it and behold the girdle was rotten, so that it was fit for no use.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: After this manner will I make the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the great <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to rot.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> people, that will not hear my words, and that walk in the perverseness of their heart, and have gone after strange gods to serve them, and to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them: and they shall be as this girdle which is fit for no use.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For as the girdle sticketh close to the loins of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so have I brought close to me all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: that they might be my people, and for a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and for a praise, and for a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: but they would not hear.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Thou shalt speak therefore to them this word: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Every bottle shall be filled with wine.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And thou shalt say to them:</p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I will <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scatter</a> them every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from his brother, and fathers and sons in like manner, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: I will not spare, and I will not pardon: nor will I have mercy, but to destroy them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Hear ye, and give ear: Be not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Give ye <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, before it be dark, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains: you shall look for light, and he will turn it into the shadow of death, and into darkness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But if you will not hear this, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall weep in secret for your <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: weeping it shall weep, and my eyes shall run down with tears, because the flock of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is carried away captive.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Say to the king, and to the queen: Humble yourselves, sit down: for the crown of your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is come down from your head.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The cities of the south are shut up, and there is none to open them: all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> is carried away captive with an entire captivity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Lift up your eyes, and see, you that come from the north: where is the flock that is given thee, thy beautiful cattle?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee? for thou hast taught them against thee, and instructed them against thy own head: shall not sorrows lay hold on thee, as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in labour?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And if thou shalt say in thy heart: Why are these things come upon me? For the greatness of thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, thy nakedness is discovered, the soles of thy feet are defiled.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> If the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> can change his skin, or the leopard his spots: you also may do well, when you have learned <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And I will <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scatter</a> them as stubble, which is carried away by the wind in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> This is thy lot, and the portion of thy measure from me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, because thou hast forgotten me, and hast trusted in falsehood.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Wherefore I have also bared thy thighs against thy face, and thy shame hath appeared.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neighing, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of thy fornication: and thy abominations, upon the hills in the field.
