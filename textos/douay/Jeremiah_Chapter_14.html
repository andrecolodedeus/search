<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For the destruction of the land, because there came no rain upon the earth, the husbandman were confounded, they covered their heads.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Yea, the hind also brought forth in the field, and left it, because there was no grass.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the wild asses stood upon the rocks, they snuffed up the wind like dragons, their eyes failed, because there was no grass.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> O expectation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble: why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> turning in to lodge?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Why wilt thou be as a wandering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as a mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that cannot save? but thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, art among us, and thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is called upon by us, forsake us not.</span><br />
