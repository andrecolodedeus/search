<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> If <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Samuel shall stand before me, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not towards this people: cast them out from my sight, and let them go forth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And if they shall say unto thee: Whither shall we go forth? thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Such as are for death, to death: and such as are for the sword, to the sword: and such as are for famine, to famine: and such as are for captivity, to captivity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I will visit them with four kinds, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: The sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I will give them up to the rage of all the kingdoms of the earth: because of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, for all that he did in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For who shall have pity on thee, O <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for thy peace?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thou hast forsaken me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thou art gone backward: and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will destroy thee: I am weary of entreating thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I will <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scatter</a> them with a fan in the gates of the land: I have killed and destroyed my people, and yet they are not returned from their ways.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Their <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are multiplied unto me above the sand of the sea: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young man a spoiler at noonday: I have cast a terror on a sudden upon the cities.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> She that hath borne seven is become weak, her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath fainted away: her sun is gone down, while it was yet day: she is confounded, and ashamed: and the residue of them I will give up to the sword in the sight of their enemies, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Woe is me, my mother: why hast thou borne me a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of strife, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of contention to all the earth? I have not lent on <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, neither hath any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lent to me on <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>: yet all <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> saith to me: Assuredly it shall be well with thy remnant, assuredly I shall help thee in the time of affliction, and in the time of tribulation against the enemy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Shall iron be allied with the iron from the north, and the brass? <span class="stiki"><strong>Shall iron be allied, etc...</strong> Shall the iron, that is, the strength of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, stand against the stronger iron of the north, that is, of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>: or enter into an alliance upon equal footing with it? No certainly: but it must be broken by it.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thy riches and thy treasures I will give unto spoil for nothing, because of all thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even in all thy borders.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I will bring thy enemies out of a land, which thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> not: for a fire is kindled in my rage, it shall burn upon you.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a>, remember me, and visit me, and defend me from them that persecute me, do not defend me in thy patience: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that for thy sake I have suffered reproach. <span class="stiki"><strong>Do not defend me in thy patience...</strong> That is, let not thy patience and longsuffering, which thou usest towards sinners, keep thee from making haste to my assistance.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word was to me a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy and gladness of my heart</a>: for thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is called upon me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I sat not in the assembly of jesters, nor did I make a boast of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>--> of thy hand: I sat alone, because thou hast filled me with threats.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Why is my sorrow become perpetual, and my wound desperate so as to refuse to be healed? it is become to me as the falsehood of deceitful waters that cannot be trusted.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: If thou wilt be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, I will <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> thee, and thou shalt stand before my face; and thou wilt separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall be turned to thee, and thou shalt not be turned to them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I will make thee to this people as a strong wall of brass: and they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and I will <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> thee out of the hand of the mighty.</span></blockquote>
