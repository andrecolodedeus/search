<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons and daughters in this place.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> concerning the sons and daughters, that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them: and concerning their fathers, of whom they were born in this land:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> They shall die by the death of grievous illnesses: they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->buried<!--</a>-->, they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed with the sword, and with famine: and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Enter not into the house of feasting, neither go thou to mourn, nor to comfort them: because I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my mercy and commiserations.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Both the great and the little shall die in this land: they shall not be <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->buried<!--</a>--> nor lamented, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall not cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they shall not break bread among them to him that mourneth, to comfort him for the dead: neither shall they give them for their father and mother.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And do not thou go into the house of feasting, to sit with them, and to eat and drink:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold I will take away out of this place in your sight, and in your days the voice of mirth, and the voice of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when thou shalt tell this people all these words, and they shall say to thee: Wherefore hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> pronounced against us all this great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? what is our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>? and what is our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Thou shalt say to them: Because your fathers forsook me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and went after strange gods, and served them, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> them: and they forsook me, and kept not my law.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And you also have done worse than your fathers: for behold every one of you walketh after the perverseness of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart, so as not to hearken to me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So I will cast you forth out of this land, into a land which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, nor your fathers: and there you shall serve strange gods day and night, which shall not give you any rest.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Therefore behold the days come, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, when it shall be said no more: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, that brought forth the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But, The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, that brought the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> out of the land of the north, and out of all the lands to which I cast them out: and I will bring them again into their land, which I gave to their fathers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Behold I will send many fishers, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and they shall fish them: and after this I will send them many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For my eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> hath not been hid from my eyes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I will repay first their double <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and they have filled my inheritance with their abominations.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my might, and my strength, and my refuge in the day of tribulation: to thee the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall come from the ends of the earth, and shall say: Surely our fathers have possessed lies, a vanity which hath not profited them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Shall a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> make gods unto himself and they are no gods?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Therefore behold I will this once cause them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I will show them my hand and my power: and they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></blockquote>
