<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I went down into the potter's house, and behold he was doing a work on the wheel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the vessel was broken which he was making of clay with his hands: and turning he made another vessel, as it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in his eyes to make it.</span>
