<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And go forth into the valley of the son of Ennom, which is by the entry of the earthen gate: and there thou shalt proclaim the words that I shall tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt say:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, O ye kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and ye inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold I will bring an affliction upon this place: so that whosoever shall hear it, his ears shall tingle:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have profaned this place: and have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> therein to strange gods, whom neither they nor their fathers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, nor the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and they have filled this place with the blood of innocents.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they have built the high places of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>, to burn their children with fire for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>: which I did not command, nor speak of, neither did it once come into my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore behold the days come, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of Ennom, but the valley of slaughter.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I will defeat the counsel of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in this place: and I will destroy them with the sword in the sight of their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and I will give their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss because of all the plagues thereof.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and with the flesh of their daughters: and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege, and in the distress wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.</span></blockquote>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Thus will I do to this place, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and to the inhabitants thereof: and I will make this city as Topheth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the houses of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the houses of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> as the place of Topheth: all the houses upon whose roofs they have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to all the host of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and have poured out drink <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> to strange gods.</span></blockquote>
