<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst: I will not serve. For on every high hill, and under every green tree thou didst prostitute thyself.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Yet, I planted thee a chosen vineyard, all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> seed: how then art thou turned unto me into that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for nothing, O strange vineyard?</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> How canst thou say: I am not polluted, I have not walked after <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>? see thy ways in the valley, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what thou hast done: as a swift runner pursuing his course.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> A wild ass accustomed to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> in the desire of his heart, snuffed up the wind of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: none shall turn her away: all that seek her shall not fail: in her monthly filth they shall find her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Keep thy foot from being bare, and thy throat from thirst.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And thou hast said: I am without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and am innocent: and therefore let thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> be turned away from me.
