<h1>Jeremiah Chapter 20</h1>
<div class="h1a">The prophet is persecuted: he denounces captivity to his persecutors, and bemoans himself.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now Phassur the son of Emmer, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who was appointed chief in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, heard Jeremias <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a> these words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Phassur struck <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, and put him in the stocks, that were in the upper gate of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when it was light the next day, Phassur brought Jeremias out of the stocks. And Jeremias said to him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath not called thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Phassur, but fear on every side. <span class="stiki"><strong>Phassur...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> signifies increase and principality: and therefore is here changed to Magor-Missabib, or fear on every side: to denote the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that should come upon him in punishment of his opposing the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Behold I will deliver thee up to fear, thee and all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall see it, and I will give all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> into the hand of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>: and he shall carry them away to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and shall strike them with the sword.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I will give all the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->substance<!--</a>--> of this city, and all its labour, and every precious thing thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> will I give into the hands of their enemies: and they shall pillage them, and take them away, and carry them to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But thou Phassur, and all that dwell in thy house, shall go into captivity, and thou shalt go to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and there thou shalt die, and there thou shalt be <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->buried<!--</a>-->, thou and all thy friends, to whom thou hast <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> a lie.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Thou hast deceived me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I am deceived: thou hast been stronger than I, and thou hast prevailed. I am become a laughingstock all the day, all scoff at me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thou hast deceived, etc...</strong> The meaning of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, is not to charge <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with any untruth; but what he calls deceiving, was only the concealing from him, when he accepted of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetical</a> commission, the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which the execution of that commission was to bring upon him.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For I am speaking now this long time, crying out against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and I often proclaim devastation: and the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> is made a reproach to me, and a derision all the day.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then I said: I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: and there came in my heart as a burning fire, shut up in my bones, and I was wearied, not being able to bear it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For I heard the reproaches of many, and terror on every side: Persecute him, and let us persecute him: from all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->familiars<!--</a>-->, and continued at my side: if by any means he may be deceived, and we may prevail against him, and be revenged on him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is with me as a strong warrior: therefore they that persecute me shall fall, and shall be weak: they shall be greatly confounded, because they have not understood the everlasting reproach, which never shall be effaced.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, prover of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, who seest the reins and the heart: let me see, I beseech thee, thy vengeance on them: for to thee I have laid open my cause. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let me see, etc...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> proceeded not from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or ill will, but <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Sing ye to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, praise the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: because he hath delivered the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the poor out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> be the day wherein I was born: let not the day in which my mother bore me, be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Cursed be the day, etc...</strong> In these, and the following words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, there is a certain figure of speech to express with more energy the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to which his birth had exposed him.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that brought the tidings to my father, saying: A man child is born to thee: and made him greatly rejoice.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Let that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be as the cities which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath overthrown, and hath not repented: let him hear a cry in the morning, and howling at <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->noontide<!--</a>-->:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Who slew me not from the womb, that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb an everlasting <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->conception<!--</a>-->.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Why came I out of the womb, to see labour and sorrow, and that my days should be spent in confusion?</span></blockquote>
