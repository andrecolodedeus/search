<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And thou shalt say:</p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Execute judgment and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and deliver him that is oppressed out of the hand of the oppressor: and afflict not the stranger, the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">fatherless</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, nor oppress them <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>: and shed not innocent blood in this place.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For if you will do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house, kings of the race of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> sitting upon his throne, and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants, and their people.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But if you will not hearken to these words: I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by myself, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that this house shall become a desolation.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to the house of the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: Thou art to me Galaad the head of <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a>: yet surely I will make thee a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and cities not habitable. <span class="stiki"><strong>Galaad the head of Libanus...</strong> By Galaad, a rich and fruitful country, is here signified the royal palace of the kings of the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: by <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a>, a high mountain abounding in <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar trees</a>, the populous city of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I will prepare against thee the destroyer and his weapons: and they shall cut down thy chosen <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a>, and shall cast them headlong into the fire. <span class="stiki"><strong>Prepare...</strong> Literally, sanctify.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And many nations shall pass by this city: and they shall say every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his neighbour: Why hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> done so to this great city?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they shall answer: Because they have forsaken the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> strange gods, and served them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Weep not for him that is dead, nor bemoan him with your tears: lament him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native country. <span class="stiki"><strong>Weep not for him that is dead, etc...</strong> He means the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> king <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>, who by death was taken away, so as not to see the miseries of his country.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to Sellum the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, who reigned instead of his father, who went forth out of this place: He shall return hither no more:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But in the place, to which I have removed him, there shall he die, and he shall not see this land any more.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Woe to him that buildeth up his house by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and his chambers not in <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->: that will oppress his friend without cause, and will not pay him his wages.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Who saith: I will build me a wide house, and large chambers: who openeth to himself windows, and maketh roofs of <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>, and painteth them with vermilion.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Shalt thou reign, because thou comparest thyself to the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>? did not thy father eat and drink, and do <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and it was then well with him?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He judged the cause of the poor and needy for his own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: was it not therefore because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But thy eyes and thy heart are set upon <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and upon shedding innocent blood, and upon oppression, and running after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil works</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I spoke to thee in thy prosperity: and thou saidst: I will not hear: this hath been thy way from thy youth, because thou hast not heard my voice.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The wind shall feed all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity and then shalt thou be confounded, and ashamed of all thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span><br />
