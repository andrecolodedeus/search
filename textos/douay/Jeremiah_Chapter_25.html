<div class="h1a">The prophet foretells the seventy years captivity; after that the destruction of Babylon, and other nations.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">word</a> that came to Jeremias concerning all the people of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, in the fourth year of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, (the same is the first year of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> king of Babylon),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Which <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> spoke to all the people of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and to all the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> From the thirteenth year of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> the son of Ammon king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> until this day: this is the three and twentieth year, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> before day, and speaking, and you have not hearkened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath sent to you all his servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> early, and sending, and you have not hearkened, nor inclined your ears to hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> When he said: Return ye, every one from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way, and from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> devices, and you shall dwell in the land which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given to you, and your fathers for ever and ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And go not after strange gods to serve them, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them: nor provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> by the works of your hands, and I will not afflict you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And you have not heard me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that you might provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: Because you have not heard my words:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Behold I will send, and take all the kindreds of the north, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon</a> my servant: and I will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all the nations that are round about it: and I will destroy them, and make them an astonishment and a hissing, and perpetual desolations. <span class="stiki"><strong>My servant...</strong> So this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> king is here called; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made him his instrument in punishing the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his people.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I will take away from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the mill and the light of the lamp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And all this land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment: and all these nations shall serve the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> seventy years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when the seventy years shall be expired, I will punish the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, and that nation, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and the land of the Chaldeans: and I will make it perpetual desolations. <span class="stiki"><strong>Punish...</strong> Literally, visit upon.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I will bring upon that land all my words, that I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book, all that Jeremias hath <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> against all nations:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For they have served them, whereas they were many nations, and great kings: and I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their hands.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Take the cup of wine of this fury at my hand: and thou shalt make all the nations to drink thereof, into which I shall send thee.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And I took the cup at the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I presented it to all the nations to drink of it, to which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent me:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And thou shalt <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> unto them all these words, and thou shalt say to them:</p>
