<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, came this word from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: stand in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and speak to all the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, out of which they come, to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, all the words which I have commanded thee to speak unto them: leave not out one word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> If so be they will hearken and be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> every one from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way; that I may repent me of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I think to do unto them for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of their doings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: If you will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have given you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> To give ear to the words of my servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, whom I sent to you <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up early: and sending, and you have not hearkened:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I will make this house like Silo: and I will make this city a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> to all the nations of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and all the people heard Jeremias speaking these words in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when Jeremias had made an end of speaking all that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him to speak to all the people, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and all the people laid hold on him, saying: Let him be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Why hath he <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: This house shall be like Silo; and this city shall be made desolate, without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered together against Jeremias in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the princes of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> heard these words: and they went up from the king's house into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and sat in the entry of the new gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> spoke to the princes, and to all the people, saying: The <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of death is for this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: because he hath <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> against this city, as you have heard with your ears.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then Jeremias spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent me to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> concerning this house, and concerning this city all the words that you have heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now therefore amend your ways, and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will repent him of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he hath spoken against you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But as for me, behold I am in your hands: do with me what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and right in your eyes:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye, and understand, that if you put me to death, you will shed innocent blood against your own selves, and against this city, and the inhabitants thereof. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent me to you, to speak all these words in your hearing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then the princes, and all the people said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: There is no <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of death for this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for he hath spoken to us in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And some of the ancients of the land rose up: and they spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Micheas<!--</a>--> of Morasthi was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the days of <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and he spoke to all the people of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saying: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: Sion shall be ploughed like a field, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> shall be a heap of stones: and the mountain of the house the high places of woods.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Did <a href="../cathen/05737a.htm">Ezechias</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, condemn him to death? did they not fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and beseech the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> repented of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he had spoken against them? therefore we are doing a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> There was also a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, Urias the son of Semei of Cariathiarim: and he <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> against this city, and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>-->, and all his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in power, and his princes heard these words: and the king sought to put him to death. And Urias heard it, and was afraid, and fled and went into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And king <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> sent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Elnathan the son of Achobor, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they brought Urias out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and brought him to king <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>-->, and he slew him with the sword: and he cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> So the hand of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam the son of Saphan</a> was with Jeremias, that he should not be delivered into the hands of the people, to put him to death.</span></p>
