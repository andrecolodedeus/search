<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath made thee <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> instead of Joiada the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, that thou shouldst be ruler in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, over every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that raveth and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesieth</a>, to put him in the stocks, and into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And now why hast thou not rebuked <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the Anathothite</a>, who <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesieth</a> to you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For he hath also sent to us in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, saying: It is a long time: build ye houses, and dwell in them: and plant gardens, and eat the fruits of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So Sophonias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> read this <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>, in the hearing of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Jeremias, saying:</span>
