<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> It is commonly said: If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife, and she go from him, and <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, shall he return to her any more? shall not that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be polluted, and defiled? but thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers: nevertheless return to me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I will receive thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Lift up thy eyes on high: and see where thou hast not prostituted thyself: thou didst sit in the ways, waiting for them as a robber in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications, and with thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Therefore the showers were withholden, and there was no lateward rain: thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou wouldst not blush.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Therefore at the least from this time call to me: Thou art my father, the guide of my virginity:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Wilt thou be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for ever, or wilt thou continue unto the end? Behold, thou hast spoken, and hast done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, and hast been able.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me in the days of king <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Hast thou seen what rebellious <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath done? she hath gone of herself upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and hath played the harlot there.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when she had done all these things, I said: Return to me, and she did not return. And her treacherous sister <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> saw,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> That because the rebellious <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had played the harlot, I had <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put her away</a>, and given her a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>: yet her treacherous sister <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> was not afraid, but went and played the harlot also herself.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And by the facility of her fornication she defiled the land, and played the harlot with stones and with stocks.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And after all this, her treacherous sister <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> hath not returned to me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: The rebellious <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath justified her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in comparison of the treacherous <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Go, and proclaim these words towards the north, and thou shalt say:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Return, O rebellious <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I will not turn away my face from you: for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I will not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for ever.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But yet acknowledge thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, that thou hast transgressed against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>: and thou hast scattered thy ways to strangers under every green tree, and hast not heard my voice, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Return, O ye revolting children, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for I am your I husband: and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a kindred, and will bring you into Sion.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I will give you pastors according to my own heart, and they shall feed you with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and doctrine.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when you shall be multiplied, and increase in the land in those days, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, they shall say no more: The <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>: neither shall it come upon the heart, neither shall they remember it, neither shall it be visited, neither shall that be done any more.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> shall be called the throne of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and all the nations shall be gathered together to it, in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and they shall not walk after the perversity of their most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> heart.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> In those days the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a> shall go to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land which I gave to your fathers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But I said: How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a lovely land, the goodly inheritance of the armies of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>? And I said: Thou shalt call me father and shalt not cease to walk after me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> her lover, so hath the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> A voice was heard in the highways, weeping and howling of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: because they have made their way <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, they have forgotten the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Return, you rebellious children, and I will heal your rebellions. Behold we come to thee: for thou art the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> In very deed the hills were <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">liars</a>, and the multitude of the mountains: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Confusion hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> We shall sleep in our confusion, and our shame shall cover us, because we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, we and our fathers from our youth even to this day, and we have not hearkened to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.</span></blockquote>
