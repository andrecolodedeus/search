<div class="h1a">God will deliver his people from their captivity: Christ shall be their king: and his Church shall be glorious for ever.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> This is the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">word</a> that came to Jeremias from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: Write thee all the words that I have spoken to thee, in a book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For behold the days come, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I will bring again the captivity of my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and I will cause them to return to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And these are the words that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: We have heard a voice of terror: there is fear and no peace.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Ask ye, and see if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> bear children? why then have I seen every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his hands on his loins, like a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in labour, and all faces are turned yellow?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Alas, for that day is great, neither is there the like to it; and it is the time of tribulation to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, but he shall be saved out of it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst his bands: and strangers shall no more rule over him:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But they shall serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">David their king</a>, whom I will raise up to them. <span class="stiki"><strong>David...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> of the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore fear thou not, my servant <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, neither be dismayed, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: for behold, I will save thee from a country afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity: and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a> shall return, and be at rest, and abound with all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and there shall be none whom he may fear:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For I am with thee, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to save thee: for I will utterly consume all the nations, among which I have <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a> thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->, that thou mayst not seem to thyself innocent.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound is very grievous.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> There is none to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> thy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> to bind it up: thou hast no healing medicines.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> All thy lovers have forgotten thee, and will not seek after thee: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with cruel chastisement: by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of the multitude of thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are hardened.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sorrow is incurable: for the multitude of thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and for thy hardened <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> I have done these things to thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Therefore all they that devour thee, shall be devoured: and all thy enemies shall be carried into captivity: and they that waste thee shall be wasted, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For I will close up thy scar, and will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Because they have called thee, O Sion, an outcast: This is she that hath none to seek after her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold I will bring back the captivity of the pavilions of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and will have pity on his houses, and the city shall be built in her high place, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> shall be founded according to the order thereof.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And out of them shall come forth praise, and the voice of them that play: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be made few: and I will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> them, and they shall not be lessened.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And their children shall be as from the beginning, and their assembly shall be permanent before me: and I will visit against all that afflict them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And their leader shall be of themselves: and their prince shall come forth from the midst of them: and I will bring him near, and he shall come to me: for who is this that setteth his heart to approach to me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And you shall be my people: and I will be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Behold the whirlwind of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, his fury going forth, a violent storm, it shall rest upon the head of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will not turn away the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of his indignation, till he have executed and performed the thought of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand these things.</span></blockquote>
