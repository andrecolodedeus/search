<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: The people that were left and escaped from the sword, found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall go to his rest.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath appeared from afar to me. Yea I have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> thee with an everlasting <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I will build thee again, and thou shalt be built, O <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: thou shalt again be adorned with thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in the <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dances</a> of them that make merry.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Thou shalt yet plant vineyards in the mountains of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>: the planters shall plant, and they shall not gather the vintage before the time.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For there shall be a day, in which the watchmen on mount Ephraim, shall cry: Arise, and let us go up to Sion to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Rejoice ye in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and neigh before the head of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: shout ye, and sing, and say: Save, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thy people, the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Behold I will bring them from the north country, and will gather them from the ends of the earth and among them shall be the blind, and the lame, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with child, and she that is bringing forth, together, a great company of them returning hither.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> They shall come with weeping: and I will bring them back in mercy: and I will bring them through the torrents of waters in a right way, and they shall not stumble in it: for I am a father to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and Ephraim is my <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, O ye nations, and declare it in the islands that are afar off, and say: He that <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> will gather him: and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and delivered him out of the hand of one that was mightier than he.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they shall come, and shall give praise in mount Sion: and they shall flow together to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for the corn, and wine, and oil, and the increase of cattle and herds, and their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be as a watered garden, and they shall be hungry no more.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then shall the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> rejoice in the <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dance</a>, the young men and old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> together: and I will turn their mourning into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and will comfort them, and make them joyful after their sorrow.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I will fill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with fatness: and my people shall be filled with my <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: A voice was heard on high of lamentation, of mourning, and weeping, of <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted for them, because they are not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thy eyes tears: for there is a reward for thy work, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and they shall return out of the land of the enemy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And there is <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> for thy last end, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and the children shall return to their own borders.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Hearing I heard Ephraim when he went into captivity: thou hast chastised me, and I was instructed, as a young bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. Convert me, and I shall be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, for thou art the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For after thou didst <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> me, I did <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>: and after thou didst show unto me, I struck my thigh: I am confounded and ashamed, because I have borne the reproach of my youth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Surely Ephraim is an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> son to me, surely he is a tender child: for since I spoke of him, I will still remember him. Therefore are my bowels troubled for him: pitying I will pity him, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Set thee up a watchtower, make to thee bitterness: direct thy heart into the right way, wherein thou hast walked: return, O <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, return to these thy cities.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> How long wilt thou be dissolute in deliciousness, O wandering daughter? for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath created a new thing upon the earth: A WOMAN SHALL COMPASS A MAN.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: As yet shall they say this word in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring back their captivity: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, the beauty of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and all his cities shall dwell therein together: the husbandman and they that drive the flocks.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For I have inebriated the weary <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and I have filled every hungry <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Upon this I was as it were awaked out of a sleep, and I saw, and my sleep was sweet to me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Behold the days come, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and I will sow the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a> with the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and with the seed of beasts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to throw down, and to scatter, and destroy, and afflict: so will I watch over them, to build up, and to plant them, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> In those days they shall say no more: The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the children are set on edge.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But every one shall die for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>: every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall eat the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Behold the days shall come, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I will make a new covenant with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and with the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the covenant which they made void, and I had dominion over them, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, after those days, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: I will give my law in their bowels, and I will write it in their heart: and I will be their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they shall be my people.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And they shall teach no more every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his neighbour, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his brother, saying: Know the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for all shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me from the least of them even to the greatest, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for I will forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and I will remember their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who giveth the sun for the light of the day, the order of the moon and of the stars, for the light of the night: who stirreth up the sea, and the waves thereof roar, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> is his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span><br />
