<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> At that time the army of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> besieged <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> was shut up in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, which was in the house of the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For Sedecias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> had shut him up, saying: Why dost thou <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>, saying: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold I will give this city into the hand of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, and he shall take it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Sedecias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans: but he shall be delivered into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>: and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he shall lead Sedecias to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>: and he shall be there till I visit him, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Hanameel my uncle's son came to me, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, to the entry of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and said to me: Buy my field, which is in <a href="../cathen/01457a.htm">Anathoth</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>: for the right of inheritance is thine, and thou art next of kin to possess it. And I understood that this was the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that is in <a href="../cathen/01457a.htm">Anathoth</a>: and I weighed him the money, seven staters, and ten pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I wrote it in a book and sealed it, and took <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>: and I weighed him the money in the balances.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I took the deed of the purchase that was sealed, and the stipulations, and the ratifications with the seals that were on the outside.</span>
