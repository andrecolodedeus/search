<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Yet hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, O Sedecias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But thou shalt die in peace, and according to the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they burn thee: and they shall mourn for thee, saying: Alas, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for I have spoken the word, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Die in peace...</strong> That is, by a natural death.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> spoke all these words to Sedecias the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">word</a> that came to Jeremias from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, after that king Sedecias had made a covenant with all the people in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> making a proclamation:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> That every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should let his manservant, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his maidservant, being <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, go free: and that they should not lord it over them, to wit, over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> their brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And all the princes, and all the people who entered into the covenant, heard that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should let his manservant, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his maidservant go free, and should no more have dominion over them: and they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, and let them go free.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But afterwards they turned: and brought back again their servants and their handmaids, whom they had let go free, and brought them into subjection as menservants and maidservants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Jeremias from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, out of the house of <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> At the end of seven years, let ye go every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his brother being a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrew</a>, who hath been sold to thee, so he shall serve thee six years: and thou shalt let him go free from thee: and your fathers did not hearken to me, nor did they incline their ear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And you turned to day, and did that which was right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother: and you made a covenant in my sight, in the house upon which my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is invocated.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And you are fallen back, and have defiled my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: and you have brought back again every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his manservant, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his maidservant, whom you had let go free, and set at liberty: and you have brought them into subjection to be your servants and handmaids.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: You have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his brother and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his friend: behold I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine: and I will cause you to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I will give the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that have transgressed my covenant, and have not performed the words of the covenant which they agreed to in my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>-->, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts thereof:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The princes of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the princes of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the eunuchs, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and all the people of the land that passed between the parts of the calf:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I will give them into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Sedecias the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and his princes, I will give into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their lives, and into the hands of the armies of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, which are gone from you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Behold I will command, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I will bring them again to this city, and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> a desolation, without an inhabitant.</span></p>
