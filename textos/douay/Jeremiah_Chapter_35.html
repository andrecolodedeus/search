<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Go to the house of the <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechabites</a>: and speak to them, and bring them into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, into one of the chambers of the treasures, and thou shalt give them wine to drink. <span class="stiki"><strong>Rechabites...</strong> These were of the race of Jethro, father in law to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I took Jezonias the son of Jeremias the son of Habsanias, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechabites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I brought them into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, to the treasure house of the sons of Hanan, the son of Jegedelias the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was by the treasure house of the princes, above the treasure of Maasias the son of Sellum, who was keeper of the entry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I set before the sons of the house of the <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechabites</a> pots full of wine, and cups: and I said to them: Drink ye wine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they answered: We will not drink wine: because Jonadab the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, our father, commanded us, saying: You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your children, for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Neither shall ye build houses, nor sow reed, nor plant vineyards, nor have any: but you shall dwell in tents all your days, that you may live many days upon the face of the earth, in which you are strangers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Therefore we have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the voice of Jonadab the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, our father, in all things that he commanded us: so as to drink no wine all our days: neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Nor to build houses to dwell in, nor to have vineyard, or field, or seed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But we have dwelt in tents, and have been <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But when <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon</a> came up to our land, we said: Come, let us go into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> from the face of the army of the Chaldeans, and from the face of the army of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>: and we have remained in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Jeremias, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Go, and say to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, and to the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: Will you not receive instruction, to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> my words, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The words of Jonadab the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a>, by which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have prevailed: and they have drunk none to this day, because they have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the commandment of their father: but I have spoken to you, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> early and speaking, and you have not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I have sent to you all my servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> early, and sending and saying: Return ye every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> way, and make your ways <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and follow not strange gods, nor worship them, and you shall dwell in the land, which I gave you and your fathers: and you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So the sons of Jonadab the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a> have constantly kept the commandment of their father, which he commanded them: but this people hath not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold I will bring upon <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and upon all the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them, and they have not heard: I have called to them, and they have not answered me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Jeremias said to the house of the <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechabites</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Because you have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the commandment of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, and have done all that he commanded you:</span>
