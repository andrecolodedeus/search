<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, that this word came to Jeremias by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Take thee a roll of a book, and thou shalt write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and against all the nations from the day that I spoke to thee, from the days of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> even to this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> If so be, when the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a> shall hear all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> way: and I will forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So Jeremias called <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> the son of Nerias: and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he spoke to him, upon the roll of a book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Jeremias commanded <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>-->, saying: I am shut up, and cannot go into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Shut up...</strong> Not that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was now in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; for the contrary appears from <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->ver<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->19<!--</a>-->, but that he kept himself shut up, by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> he had lately met with. See chap. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->26<!--</a>-->.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Go thou in therefore, and read out of the volume, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, in the hearing of all the people in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> day: and also thou shalt read them in the hearing of all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> that come out of their cities:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> If so be they may present their supplication before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and may return every one from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> way: for great is the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and indignation which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath pronounced against this people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> the son of Nerias did according to all that <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> had commanded him, reading out of the volume the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And it came to pass in the fifth year of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to all the people in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and to all the people that were come together out of the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> read out of the volume the words of Jeremias in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, in the treasury of Gamarias the son of Saphan the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, in the upper <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, in the entry of the new gate of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, in the hearing of all the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Micheas<!--</a>--> the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan had heard out of the book all the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He went down into the king's house to the secretary's chamber: and behold all the princes sat there, Elisama the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and Dalaias the son of Semeias, and Elnathan the son of Achobor, and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedecias the son of Hananias, and all the princes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Micheas<!--</a>--> told them all the words that he had heard when <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> read out of the volume in the hearing of the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Therefore all the princes sent Judi the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Chusi<!--</a>-->, to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>-->, saying: Take in thy hand the volume in which thou hast read in the hearing of the people, and come. So <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> the son of Nerias took the volume in his hand, and came to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they said to him: Sit down and read these things in our hearing. And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> read in their hearing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when they had heard all the words, they looked upon one another with astonishment, and they said to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>-->: We must tell the king all these words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they asked him, saying: Tell us how didst thou write all these words from his mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> said to them: With his mouth he pronounced all these words as if he were reading to me: and I wrote in a volume with ink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the princes said to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>-->: Go, and hide thee, both thou and Jeremias, and let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where you are.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they went in to the king into the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>: but they laid up the volume in the chamber of Elisama the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>: and they told all the words in the hearing of the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the king sent Judi that he should take the volume: who bringing it out of the chamber of Elisama the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, read it in the hearing of the king, and of all the princes that stood about the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now the king sat in the winter house, in the ninth month: and there was a hearth before him full of burning coals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when Judi had read three or four pages, he cut it with the penknife, and he cast it into the fire, that was upon the hearth, till all the volume was consumed with the fire that was on the hearth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the king and all his servants that heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But yet Elnathan, and Dalaias, and Gamarias spoke to the king, not to burn the book: and he heard them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the king commanded Jeremiel the son of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Amelech<!--</a>-->, and Saraias the son of Ezriel, and Selemias the son of Abdeel, to take up <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hid them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, after that the king had burnt the volume, and the words that <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> had written from the mouth of Jeremias, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Take thee again another volume: and write in it all the former words that were in the first volume which <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> both burnt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And thou shalt say to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Thou hast burnt that volume, saying: Why hast thou written therein, and said: The <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> shall come speedily, and shall lay waste this land: and shall cause to cease from thence <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and beast?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> against <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by night. <span class="stiki"><strong>He shall have none, etc...</strong> Because his son <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joachin<!--</a>--> or Jechonias, within three months after the death of his father, was carried away to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, so that his reign is not worthy of notice.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And I will punish him, and his seed and his servants, for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and upon the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I have pronounced against them, but they have not heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And Jeremias took another volume, and gave it to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> the son of Nerias the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>: who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> had burnt with fire: and there were added besides many more words than had been before.</span></p>
