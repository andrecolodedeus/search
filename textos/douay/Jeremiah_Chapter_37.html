<h1>Jeremiah Chapter 37</h1>
<div class="h1a">Jeremiah prophesies that the Chaldeans, who had departed from Jerusalem, would return and burn the city. He is cast into prison. His conference with Sedecias.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now king Sedecias the son of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a> reigned instead of Jechonias the son of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>-->: whom <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon</a> made king in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land did <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that he spoke in the hand of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And king Sedecias sent Juchal the son of Selemias, and Sophonias the son of Maasias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> for us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now Jeremias walked freely in the midst of the people: for they had not as yet cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And the army of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> was come out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and the Chaldeans that besieged <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, hearing these tidings, departed from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Thus shall you say to the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold the army of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their own land, into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Deceive not your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us: for they shall not go away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But if you should even beat all the army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left of them some wounded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: they shall rise up, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from his tent, and burn this city with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, because of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> army,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Jeremias went forth out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to go into the land of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>: and to divide a possession there in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>--> of the citizens,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when he was come to the gate of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of the gate, who was there in his turn, was one <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Jerias, the son of Selemias, the son of Hananias: and he took hold of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, saying: Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Jeremias answered: It is not so, I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Jerias took Jeremias and brought him to the princes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Wherefore the princes were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with Jeremias, and they beat him, and cast him into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> that was in the house of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>: for he was chief over the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So Jeremias went into the house of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and into the dungeon: and Jeremias remained there many days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then Sedecias the king, sending, took him: and asked him secretly in his house, and said: Is there, thinkest thou, any word from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>? And Jeremias said. There is. And he said: Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Jeremias said to king Sedecias: In what have I offended against thee, or thy servants, or thy people, that thou hast cast me into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Where are your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> to you, and said: The <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> shall not come against you, and against this land?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now therefore hear, I beseech thee, my lord the king: let my petition be accepted in thy sight: and send me not back into the house of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, lest I die there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremias should be committed into the entry of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>: and that they should give him daily a piece of bread, beside broth, till all the bread in the city were spent: and Jeremias remained in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span></p>
