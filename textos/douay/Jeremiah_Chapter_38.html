<h1>Jeremiah Chapter 38</h1>
<div class="h1a">The prophet at the instance of the great men is cast into a filthy dungeon: he is drawn out by Abdemelech, and has another conference with the king.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now Saphatias the son of Mathan, and Gedelias the son of Phassur, and Juchal the son of Selemias, and Phassur the son of Melchias heard the words that Jeremias spoke to all the people, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Whosoever shall remain in this city, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence: but he that shall go forth to the Chaldeans, shall live, and his life shall be safe, and he shall live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: This city shall surely be delivered into the hand of the army of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, and he shall take it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the princes said to the king. We beseech thee that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> may be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>: for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, that remain in this city, and the hands of the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeketh not peace to this people, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And king Sedecias said: Behold he is in your hands: for it is not lawful for the king to deny you any thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then they took Jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of Melchias the son of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Amelech<!--</a>-->, which was in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>: and they let down Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon, wherein there was no water, but mire. And Jeremias sunk into the mire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now Abdemelech the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a>, an eunuch that was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon: but the king was sitting in the gate of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Abdemelech went out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> My lord the king, these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in all that they have done against <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, casting him into the dungeon to die there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then the king commanded Abdemelech the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a>, saying: Take from hence thirty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with thee, and draw up <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> out of the dungeon, before he die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> So Abdemelech taking the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him, went into the king's house that was under the storehouse: and he took from thence old rags, and old rotten things, and he let them down by cords to Jeremias into the dungeon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Abdemelech the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> said to Jeremias: Put these old rags and these rent and rotten things under thy arms, and upon the cords: and Jeremias did so.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they drew up Jeremias with the cords, and brought him forth out of the dungeon. And Jeremias remained in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And king Sedecias sent, and took <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> to him to the third gate, that was in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and the king said to Jeremias: I will ask thee a thing, hide nothing from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then Jeremias said to Sedecias: If I shall declare it to thee, wilt thou not put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then king Sedecias <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to Jeremias, in private, saying: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, that, made us this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I will not put thee to death, nor will I deliver thee into the hands of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that seek thy life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Jeremias said to Sedecias: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: If thou wilt take a resolution and go out to the princes of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live, and this city shall not be burnt with fire: and thou shalt be safe, and thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And king Sedecias said to Jeremias: I am afraid because of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that are fled over to the Chaldeans: lest I should be delivered into their hands, and they should abuse me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But Jeremias answered: They shall not deliver thee: hearken, I beseech thee, to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which I speak to thee, and it shall be well with thee, and thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath shown me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Behold all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that are left in the house of the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, shall be brought out to the princes of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>: and they shall say: Thy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of peace have deceived thee, and have prevailed against thee, they have plunged thy feet in the mire, and in a slippery place and they have departed from thee. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thy men of peace...</strong> Viri pacifici <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->tui<!--</a>-->. That is thy <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> friends promising thee peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsels involving thee in misery.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And all thy wives, and thy children shall be brought out to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape their hands, but thou shalt be taken by the hand of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>: and he shall burn this city with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Then Sedecias said to Jeremias: Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these words, and thou shalt not die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee, and shall come to thee, and say to thee: Tell us what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not kill thee: and also what the king said to thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Thou shalt say to them: I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not command me to be carried back into the house of <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, to die there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> So all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him: and he spoke to them according to all the words that the king had commanded him: and they left him: for nothing had been heard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But Jeremias remained in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, until the day that <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was taken: and it came to pass that <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was taken.</span></p>
