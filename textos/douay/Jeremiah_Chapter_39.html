<div class="h1a">After two years' siege Jerusalem is taken. Sedecias is carried before Nebuchadnezzer, who kills his sons in his sight, and then puts out his eyes. Jeremiah is set at liberty.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the ninth year of Sedecias king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, in the tenth month, came <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon</a>, and all his army to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and they besieged it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And in the eleventh year of Sedecias, in the fourth month, the fifth day of the month, the city was opened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And all the princes of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> came in, and sat in the middle gate: Neregel, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim, Rabsares, Neregel, Serezer, Rebmag, and all the rest of the princes of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when Sedecias the king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> saw them, they fled: and they went forth in the night out of the city by the way of the king's garden, and by the gate that was between the two walls, and they went out to the way of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them: and they took Sedecias in the plain of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and when they had taken him, they brought him to <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon</a> to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> slew the sons of Sedecias, in Reblatha, before his eyes: and the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> slew all the nobles of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He also put out the eyes of Sedecias: and bound him with fetters, to be carried to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the Chaldeans burnt the king's house, and the houses of the people with fire, and they threw down the wall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Nabuzardan the general of the army carried away captive to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to him, and the rest of the people that remained.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But Nabuzardan the general left some of the poor people that had nothing at all, in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and he gave them vineyards, and <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cisterns</a> at that time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon</a> had given charge to Nabuzardan the general concerning Jeremias, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Take him, and set thy eyes upon him, and do him no harm: but as he hath a mind, so do with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Therefore Nabuzardan the general sent, and Nabuzardan, and Rabsares, and Neregel, and Sereser, and Rebmag, and all the nobles of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Sent and took Jeremias out of the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and committed him to Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam the son of Saphan</a>, that he might go home, and dwell among the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Jeremias, when he was yet shut up in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, saying: Go, and tell Abdemelech the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold I will bring my words upon this city unto <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and not unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and they shall be accomplished in thy sight in that day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And I will deliver thee in that day, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whom thou fearest:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But delivering, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword: but thy life shall be saved for thee, because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
