<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For a voice of one declaring from <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, and giving notice of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> from mount Ephraim.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Say ye to the nations: Behold it is heard in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, that guards are coming from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Thy ways, and thy devices have brought these things upon thee: this is thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, because it is bitter, because it hath touched thy heart.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> My bowels, my bowels are in part, the senses of my heart are troubled within me, I will not hold my peace, for my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath heard the sound of the trumpet, the cry of battle.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Destruction upon destruction is called for, and all the earth is laid waste: my tents are destroyed on a sudden, and my pavilions in a moment.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For my foolish people have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me: they are foolish and senseless children: they are wise to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> they have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> I beheld the earth, and lo it was void, and nothing: and the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and there was no light in them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> I looked upon the mountains, and behold they trembled: and all the hills were troubled.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> I beheld, and lo there was no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and all the birds of the air were gone.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> I looked, and behold <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a> was a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: and all its cities were destroyed at the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>--> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and at the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>--> of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of his indignation.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: All the land shall be desolate, but yet I will not utterly destroy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> The Earth shall mourn, and the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> shall lament from above: because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I have not repented, neither am I turned away from it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> At the voice of the horsemen, and the archers, all the city is fled away: they have entered into thickets and climbed up the rocks: all the cities are forsaken, and there dwelleth not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do? though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, and paintest thy eyes with stibic stone, thou shalt dress thyself out in vain: thy lovers have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> thee, they will seek thy life.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For I have heard the voice as of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in travail, anguishes as of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in labour of a child. The voice of the daughter of Sion, dying away, spreading her hands: Woe is me, for my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath fainted because of them that are slain.</span></blockquote>
