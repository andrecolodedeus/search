<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">word</a> that came to Jeremias from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, after that Nabuzardan the general had let him go from Rama, when he had taken him, being bound with chains, among all them that were carried away from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and were carried to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the general of the army taking Jeremias, said to him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> hath pronounced this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon this place,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he hath brought it: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath done as he hath said: because you have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and have not hearkened to his voice, and this word is come upon you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now then behold I have loosed thee this day from the chains which were upon thy hands: if it please thee to come with me to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, come: and I will set my eyes upon thee: but if it do not please thee to come with me to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, stay here: behold all the land is before thee, as thou shalt choose, and whither it shall please thee to go, thither go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And come not with me: but dwell with Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam the son of Saphan</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> hath made governor over the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: dwell therefore with him in the midst of the people: or whithersoever it shall please thee to go, go. And the general of the army gave him victuals and presents, and let him go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Jeremias went to Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a> to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>: and dwelt with him in the midst of the people that were left in the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army that were <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a> through the countries, they and their companions, had heard that the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> had made Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a> governor of the country, and that he had committed unto him men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children, and of the poor of the land, them that had not been carried away captive to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They came to Godolias to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>: and Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and Johanan, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a>, the sons of Caree, and Sareas the son of Thanehumeth, and the children of Ophi, that were of Netophathi, and Jezonias the son of Maachati, they and their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam the son of Saphan</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to them and to their companions, saying: Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, and it shall be well with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Behold I dwell in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, that I may answer the commandment of the Chaldeans that are sent to us: but as for you, gather ye the vintage, and the harvest, and the oil, and lay it up in your vessels, and abide in your cities which you hold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Moreover all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were in <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and among the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, and in all the countries, when they heard that the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> had left a remnant in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and that he had made Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam the son of Saphan</a> ruler over them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> All the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, I say, returned out of all the places to which they had fled, and they came into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> to Godolias to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>: and they gathered wine, and a very great harvest.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the army, that had been <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a> about in the countries, came to Godolias to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they said to him: Know that <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baalis<!--</a>--> the king of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> hath sent Ismahel the son of Nathanias to kill thee. And Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But Johanan the son of Caree, spoke to Godolias privately in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, saying: I will go, and I will kill Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, lest he kill thee, and all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> be <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a>, that are gathered unto thee, and the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a> said to Johanan the son of Caree: Do not this thing: for what thou sayst of Ismahel is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.</span></p>
