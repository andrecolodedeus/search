<div class="h1a">Godolias is slain: the Jews that were with him are apprehensive of the Chaldeans.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismahel the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the royal blood, and the nobles of the king, and ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him, came to Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a> into <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>: and they ate bread there together in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Ismahel the son of Nathanias arose, and the ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, and they struck Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam, the son of Saphan</a> with the sword, and slew him whom the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> had made governor over the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Ismahel slew also all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were with Godolias in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the soldiers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And on the second day after he had killed Godolias, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> There came some from <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, and from Silo, and from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, fourscore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, with their <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beards</a> shaven, and their clothes rent, and mourning: and they had <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in their hand, to offer in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Ismahel the son of Nathanias went forth from <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a> to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and when he had met them, he said to them: Come to Godolias, the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when they were come to the midst of the city, Ismahel the son of Nathanias, slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were found among them, that said to Ismahel: Kill us not: for we have stores in the field, of wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. And he forbore, and slew them not with their brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the pit into which Ismahel cast all the dead bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whom he slew because of Godolias, is the same that king Asa made, for fear of Baasa the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: the same did Ismahel the son of Nathanias fill with them that were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then Ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>: the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>: whom Nabuzardan the general of the army had committed to Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a>. And Ismahel the son of Nathanias took them, and he departed, to go over to the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, heard of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that Ismahel the son of Nathanias had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And taking all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they went out to fight against Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and they found him by the great waters that are in Gabaon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when all the people that were with Ismahel, had seen Johanan the son of Caree, and all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, they rejoiced.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And all the people whom Ismahel had taken, went back to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>: and they returned and went to Johanan the son of Caree.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But Ismahel the son of Nathanias fled with eight <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, from the face of Johanan, and went to the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the soldiers that were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom they had recovered from Ismahel the son of Nathanias, from <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Masphath</a>, after that he had slain Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a>: <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and the children, and the eunuchs whom he had brought back from Gabaon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they departed, and sat as sojourners in Chamaam, which is near <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>: in order to go forward, and enter into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> From the face of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ismahel the son of Nathanias had slain Godolias the son of <a href="../cathen/01232d.htm">Ahicam</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> had made governor in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span></p>
