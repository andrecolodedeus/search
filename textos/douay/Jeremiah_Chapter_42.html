<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the warriors, and Johanan the son of Caree, and Jezonias, the son of Osaias, and the rest of the people from the least to the greatest came near:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they said to <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>: Let our supplication fall before thee: and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> thou for us to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> for all this remnant, for we are left but a few of many, as thy eyes do behold us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And let the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> show us the way by which we may walk, and the thing that we must do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> said to them: I have heard you: behold I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> according to your words: and whatsoever thing he shall answer me, I will declare it to you: and I will hide nothing from you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they said to Jeremias: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be witness between us of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and faithfulness, if we do not according to every thing for which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall send thee to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, we will <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, to whom we send thee: that it may be well with us when we shall hearken to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Good or evil...</strong> That is, agreeable or disagreeable.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now after ten days, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to Jeremias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he called Johanan the son of Caree, and all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to them: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to whom you sent me, to present your supplications before him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> If you will be quiet and remain in this land, I will build you up, and not pull you down: I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for now I am appeased for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I have done to you. <span class="stiki"><strong>I am appeased for the evil that I have done to you...</strong> That is, I am appeased, as I have sufficiently punished you, and now I am reconciled with you.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Fear not because of the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, of whom you are greatly afraid: fear him not, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for I am with you, to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I will show mercies to you, and will take pity on you, and will cause you to dwell in your own land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But if you say: We will not dwell in this land, neither will we hearken to the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Saying: No, but we will go into the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: where we shall see no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor suffer hunger: and there we will dwell.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For this now hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, ye remnant of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: If you set your faces to go into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and enter in to dwell there:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The sword which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and the famine, whereof you are afraid, shall cleave to you in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and there you shall die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that set their faces to go into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to dwell there, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence: none of them shall remain, nor escape from the face of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I will bring upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: As my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and my indignation hath been kindled against the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: so shall my indignation be kindled against you, when you shall enter into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and you shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, and a reproach: and you shall see this place no more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> This is the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> concerning you, O ye remnant of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: Go ye not into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certainly that I have adjured you this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For you have deceived your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: for you sent me to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> for us to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, and according to all that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> shall say to thee, so declare unto us, and we will do it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And now I have declared it to you this day, and you have not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, with regard to all the things for which he hath sent me to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certainly that you shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence in the place to which you desire to go to dwell there.</span></p>
