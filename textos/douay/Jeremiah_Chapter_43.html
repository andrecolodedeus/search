<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, that when Jeremias had made an end of speaking to the people all the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had sent him to them, all these words:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Azarias the son of Osaias, and Johanan the son of Caree, and all the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, made answer, saying to Jeremias: Thou tellest a lie: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> hath not sent thee, saying: Go not into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to dwell there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Baruch<!--</a>--> the son of Nerias setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and to cause us to be carried away captives to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So Johanan the son of Caree, and all the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of the soldiers, and all the people, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> not the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to remain in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
