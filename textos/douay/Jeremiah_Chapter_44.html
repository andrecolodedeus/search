<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">word</a> that came to Jeremias, concerning all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that dwelt in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, dwelling in <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Magdal<!--</a>-->, and in Taphnis, and in <!--<a href="../cathen/10176a.htm">-->Memphis<!--</a>-->, and in the land of Phatures, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: You have seen all this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I have brought upon <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and upon all the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and behold they are desolate this day, and there is not an inhabitant in them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Because of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which they have committed, to provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and to go and offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and worship other gods, which neither they, nor you, nor your fathers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I sent to you all my servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> early, and sending, and saying: Do not commit this abominable thing, which I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But they heard not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways, and not to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to strange gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and they are turned to desolation and waste, as at this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And now thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Why do you commit this great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that there should die of you man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, child and suckling out of the midst of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and no remnant should be left you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> In that you provoke me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> with the works of your hands, by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to other gods in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, into which you are come to dwell there: and that you should perish, and be a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, and a reproach to all the nations of the earth?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Have you forgotten the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of your fathers, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of their wives, and your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of your wives, that they have done in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They are not cleansed even to this day: neither have they feared, nor walked in the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, nor in my commandments, which I set before you and your fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Behold I will set my face upon you for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and I will destroy all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I will take the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> that have set their faces to go into the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and to dwell there; and they shall be all consumed in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: they shall fall by the sword, and by the famine: and they shall be consumed from the least even to the greatest, by the sword, and by the famine shall they die: and they shall be for an execration, and for a wonder, and for a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, and for a reproach.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I will visit them that dwell in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as I have visited <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by the sword, and by famine and by pestilence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And there shall be none that shall escape, and remain of the remnant of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that are gone to sojourn in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and that shall return into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: there shall none return but they that shall flee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that their wives <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to other gods: and all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of whom there stood by a great multitude, and all the people of them that dwelt in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in Phatures, answered Jeremias, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, we will not hearken to thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of our own mouth, to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the queen of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and to pour out drink <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> to her, as we and our fathers have done, our kings, and our princes in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and we were filled with bread, and it was well with us, and we saw no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The queen of heaven...</strong> The moon, which they <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->worshipped<!--</a>--> under this <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But since we left off to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the queen of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and to pour out frank <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword, and by famine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And if we offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the queen of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and pour out drink <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> to her: did we make cakes to worship her, to pour out drink <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> to her, without our husbands?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Jeremias spoke to all the people, to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Was it not the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> that you offered in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and in the streets of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, you and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath remembered, and hath it not entered into his heart?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> could no longer bear, because of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed: therefore your land is become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Because you have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and have not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and have not walked in his law, and in his commandments, and in his testimonies: therefore are these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> come upon you, as at this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And Jeremias said to all the people and to all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: Hear ye the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, you that dwell in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:</span>
