<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> A voice of crying from Oronaim: waste, and great destruction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is destroyed: proclaim a cry for her little ones.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up with weeping: for in the descent of Oronaim the enemies have heard a howling of destruction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Flee, save your lives: and be as heath in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For because thou hast trusted in thy bulwarks, and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chamos shall go into captivity, his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and his princes together. <span class="stiki"><strong>Chamos...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: and the valleys shall perish, and the plains shall be destroyed, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Give a flower to <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, for in its flower it shall go out: and the cities thereof shall be desolate, and uninhabited.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> hath been fruitful from his youth, and hath rested upon his lees: and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel, nor hath gone into captivity: therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed. <span class="stiki"><strong>Moab hath been fruitful...</strong> That is, rich and flourishing. <strong>And hath rested upon his lees...</strong> That is, remained in its bad morals; as wine not decanted has its lees mixed and remains muddy.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Therefore behold the days come, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I will send him <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that shall order and overturn his bottles, and they shall cast him down, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles one against another.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a> was ashamed of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, in which they trusted. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of Bethel...</strong> That is, of their <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calf</a> which they <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->worshipped<!--</a>--> in <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> How do you say: We are <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> and stout <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in battle?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is laid waste, and they have cast down her cities: and her choice young men are gone down to the slaughter: saith the king, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The destruction of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is near to come: the calamity thereof shall come on exceeding swiftly.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Come down from thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and sit in thirst, O dwelling of the daughter of <a href="../cathen/04777b.htm">Dibon</a>: because the spoiler of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is come up to thee, he hath destroyed thy bulwarks.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Stand in the way, and look out, O habitation of Aroer: inquire of him that fleeth: and say to him that hath escaped: What is done?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is confounded, because he is overthrown: howl ye, and cry, tell ye it in Arnon, that <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is wasted.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> is come upon the plain country: upon Helon, and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmaon,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And upon Carioth, and upon Bosra: and upon all the cities of the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, far or near.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The horn of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The horn of Moab is cut off...</strong> That is, the strength of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is cut off.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Make him drunk, because he lifted up himself against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> shall dash his hand in his own vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath been a derision unto thee: as though thou hadst found him amongst <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thieves</a>: for thy words therefore, which thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led away captive.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, you that dwell in <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: and be ye like the <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> that maketh her nest in the mouth of the hole in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->highest<!--</a>--> place.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> We have heard the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, he is exceeding <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>: his haughtiness, and his arrogancy, and his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and the loftiness of his heart.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, his boasting, and that the strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it endeavoured to do according as it was able.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Therefore will I lament for <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and I will cry out to all <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the brick wall that mourn.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> O vineyard of Sabama, I will weep for thee, with the mourning of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they are come even to the sea of Jazer: the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest and thy vintage.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Joy and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> is taken away from <a href="../cathen/03351a.htm">Carmel</a>, and from the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and I have taken away the wine out of the presses: the treader of the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful tune.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> From the cry of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a> even to Eleale, and to Jasa, they have uttered their voice: from <a href="../cathen/15762c.htm">Segor</a> to Oronaim, as a heifer of three years old: the waters also of Nemrim shall be very bad.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And I will take away from <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, him that offereth in the high places, and that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificeth</a> to his gods.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Therefore my heart shall sound for <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> like pipes and my heart shall sound like pipes for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the brick wall: because he hath done more than he could, therefore they have perished.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> For every head shall be bald, and every <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> shall be shaven: all hands shall be tied together, and upon every back there shall be haircloth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Upon all the housetops of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and in the streets thereof general mourning: because I have broken <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> as an useless vessel, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> How is it overthrown, and they have howled! How hath <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> bowed down the neck, and is confounded!

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold he shall fly as an eagle, and shall stretch forth his wings to <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Carioth is taken, and the strongholds are won: and the heart of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> in that day shall be as the heart of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in labour.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> shall cease to be a people: because he hath <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloried</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Fear, and the pit, and the snare come upon thee, O inhabitant of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Fear...</strong> That is, the sword of the enemy. <strong>The pit...</strong> That is, unforeseen calamities. <strong>The snare...</strong> That is, the ambushes laid by the enemy.</span></span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>: but there came a fire out of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and a flame out of the midst of Seon, and it shall devour part of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and the crown of the head of the children of tumult.</span><br />
