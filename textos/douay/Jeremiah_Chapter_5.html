<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Go about through the streets of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and see, and consider, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can find a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that executeth judgment, and seeketh <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and I will be merciful unto it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And though they say: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth; this also they will <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thy eyes are upon <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: thou hast struck them, and they have not grieved: thou hast bruised them, and they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, and they have refused to return.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But I said: Perhaps these are poor and foolish, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I will go therefore to the great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and will speak to them: for they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and behold these have altogether broken the yoke more, and have burst the bonds.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Wherefore a lion out of the wood hath slain them, a wolf in the evening hath spoiled them, a leopard watcheth for their cities: every one that shall go out thence shall be taken, because their transgressions are multiplied, their rebellions are strengthened.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> How can I be merciful to thee? thy children have forsaken me, and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by them that are not gods: I fed them to the full, and they committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and rioted in the harlot's house.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They are become as amorous horses and stallions: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Shall I not visit for these things, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>? and shall not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> take revenge on such a nation?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Scale the walls thereof, and throw them down, but do not utterly destroy: take away the branches thereof, because they are not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a> have greatly transgressed against me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They have denied the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said, It is not he: and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shall not come upon us: we shall not see the sword and famine.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have spoken in the wind, and there was no word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in them: these things therefore shall befall them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: because you have spoken this word, behold I will make my words in thy mouth as fire, and this people as wood, and it shall devour them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Behold I will bring upon you a nation from afar, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: a strong nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, nor understand what they say.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they shall eat up thy corn, and thy bread: they shall devour thy sons, and thy daughters: they shall eat up thy flocks, and thy herds: they shall eat thy vineyards, and thy figs: and with the sword they shall destroy thy strong cities, wherein thou trustest.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Nevertheless in those days, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, I will not bring you to utter destruction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And if you shall say: Why hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> done all these things to us? thou shalt say to them: As you have forsaken me, and served a strange god in your own land, so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not your own.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Declare ye this to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Jacob</a>, and publish it in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, saying:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Hear, O foolish people, and without understanding: who have eyes, and see not: and ears, and hear not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Will not you then fear me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and will you not repent at my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>-->? I have set the sand a bound for the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it shall not pass over: and the waves thereof shall toss themselves, and shall not prevail: they shall swell, and shall not pass over it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But the heart of this people is become hard of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and provoking, they are revolted and gone away.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they have not said in their heart: Let us fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, who giveth us the early and the latter rain in due season: who preserveth for us the fulness of the yearly harvest.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> have turned these things away, and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have withholden <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from you.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For among my people are found <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that lie in wait as fowlers, setting snares and traps to catch <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> As a net is full of birds, so their houses are full of <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>: therefore are they become great and enriched.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> They are grown gross and fat: and have most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a> transgressed my words. They have not judged the cause of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, they have not managed the cause of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">fatherless</a>, and they have not judged the judgment of the poor.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Shall I not visit for these things, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>? or shall not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> take revenge on such a nation?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Astonishing and wonderful things have been done in the land.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> falsehood, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> clapped their hands: and my people <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> such things: what then shall be done in the end thereof?</span></blockquote>
