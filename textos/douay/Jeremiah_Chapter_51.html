<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> The sea is come up over <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> You that have escaped the sword, come away, stand not still: remember the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> afar off, and let <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> come into your mind.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: because strangers are come upon the sanctuaries of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> If <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> should mount up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and establish her strength on high: from me there should come spoilers upon her, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Because the spoiler is come upon her, that is, upon <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and her <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are taken, and their bow is weakened, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who is a strong revenger, will surely repay.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And I will make her princes drunk, and her wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and her <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, and her rulers, and her <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and they shall sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the king whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>.</span><br />

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> The word that <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> commanded Saraias the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, when he went with king Sedecias to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, in the fourth year of his reign: now Saraias was chief over the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And Jeremias wrote in one book all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that was to come upon <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>: all these words that are written against <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And Jeremias said to Saraias: When thou shalt come into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> Thou shalt say: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it: so that there should be neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> nor beast to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the midst of the Euphrates:</span>
