<h1>Jeremiah Chapter 52</h1>
<div class="h1a">A recapitulation of the reign of Sedecias, and the destruction of Jerusalem. The number of the captives.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he did that which was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, according to all that <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joakim<!--</a>--> had done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and against <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, till he cast them out from his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>-->: and Sedecias revolted from the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon</a> came, he and all his army, against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and they besieged it, and built forts against it round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedecias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a famine overpowered the city: and there was no food for the people of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the city was broken up, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> fled, and went out of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is between the two walls, and leadeth to the king's garden, (the Chaldeans besieging the city round about), and they went by the way that leadeth to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king: and they overtook Sedecias in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> which is near <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>: and all his companions were scattered from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when they had taken the king, they carried him to the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> slew the sons of Sedecias before his eyes: and he slew all the princes of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> in Reblatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he put out the eyes of Sedecias, and bound him with fetters, and the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> brought him into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and he put him in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> till the day of his death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon</a>, came Nabuzardan the general of the army, who stood before the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he burnt the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the king's house, and all the houses of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and every great house he burnt with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the general broke down all the wall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But Nabuzardan the general carried away captives some of the poor people, and of the rest of the common sort who remained in the city, and of the fugitives that were fled over to the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, and the rest of the multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But of the poor of the land, Nabuzardan the general left some for vinedressers, and for husbandmen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The Chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>, and the bases, and the sea of brass that was in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: and they carried all the brass of them to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they took the caldrons, and the fleshhooks, and the psalteries, and the bowls, and the little mortars, and all the brazen vessels that had been used in the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>: and</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The general took away the pitchers, and the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, and the pots, and the basins, and the candlesticks, and the mortars, and the cups: as many as were of gold, in gold: and as many as were of silver, in silver:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the two pillars, and one sea, and twelve oxen of brass that were under the bases, which <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">king Solomon</a> had made in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: there was no weight of the brass of all these vessels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And concerning the pillars, one pillar was eighteen cubits high: and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about: but the thickness thereof was four fingers, and it was hollow within.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->chapiters<!--</a>--> of brass were upon both: and the height of one <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->chapiter<!--</a>--> was five cubits: and network, and pomegranates were upon the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->chapiters<!--</a>--> round about, all of brass. The same of the second pillar, and the pomegranates.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And there were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down: and the pomegranates being a hundred in all, were compassed with network.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the general took Saraias the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Sophonias the second <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the three keepers of the entry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He also took out of the city one eunuch that was chief over the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and seven <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of them that were near the king's person, that were found in the city: and a <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, an officer of the army who exercised the young soldiers: and threescore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And Nabuzardan the general took them, and brought them to the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, to Reblatha.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a> struck them, and put them to death in Reblatha, in the land of Emath: and <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> was carried away captive out of his land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> This is the people whom <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> In the eighteenth year of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, eight hundred and thirty-two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> In the three and twentieth year of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, Nabuzardan the general carried away of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> seven hundred and forty five <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. So all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were four thousand six hundred.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joachin<!--</a>--> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, in the twelfth month, the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joachin<!--</a>--> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and brought him forth out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he spoke kindly to him, and he set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he changed his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> garments, and he ate bread before him always all the days of his life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by the <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, every day a portion, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</span></p>
