<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I have likened the daughter of Sion to a beautiful and delicate <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The shepherds shall come to her with their flocks: they have pitched their tents against her round about: every one shall feed them that are under his hand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Prepare ye <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against her: arise, and let us go up at <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->midday<!--</a>-->: woe unto us, for the day is declined, for the shadows of the evening are grown longer.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Arise, and let us go up in the night, and destroy her houses.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: Hew down her trees, cast up a trench about <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: this is the city to be visited, all oppression is in the midst of her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> As a <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cistern</a> maketh its water cold, so hath she made her <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> cold: <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and spoil shall be heard in her, infirmity and stripes are continually before me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Be thou instructed, O <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, lest my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> depart from thee, lest I make thee desolate, a land uninhabited.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: They shall gather the remains of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as in a vine, even to one cluster: turn back thy hand, as a grapegatherer into the basket.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> To whom shall I speak? and to whom shall I testify, that he may hear? behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot hear: behold the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> is become unto them a reproach: and they will not receive it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Therefore am I full of the fury of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the child abroad, and upon the council of the young men together: for man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall be taken, the ancient and he that is full of days.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And their houses shall be turned over to others, with their lands and their wives together: for I will stretch forth my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For from the least of them even to the greatest, all are given to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: and from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> even to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, all are guilty of <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people disgracefully, saying: Peace, peace: and there was no peace.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> They were confounded, because they committed abomination: yea, rather they were not confounded with confusion, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not how to blush: wherefore they shall fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall fall down, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Stand ye on the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> way, and walk ye in it: and you shall find refreshment for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And they said: We will not walk.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And I appointed watchmen over you, saying: Hearken ye to the sound of the trumpet. And they said: We will not hearken.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore hear, ye nations, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O congregation, what great things I will do to them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Hear, O earth: Behold I will bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon this people, the fruits of their own thoughts: because they have not heard my words, and they have cast away my law.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> To what purpose do you bring me frankincense from <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a>, and the sweet smelling cane from a far country? your <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> are not acceptable, nor are your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> pleasing to me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold I will bring destruction upon this people, by which fathers and sons together shall fall, neighbour and kinsman shall perish.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> They shall lay hold on arrow and shield: they are cruel, and will have no mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea: and they shall mount upon horses, prepared as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, against thee, O daughter of Sion.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> We have heard the fame thereof, our hands grow feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in labour.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Go not out into the fields, nor walk in the highway: for the sword of the enemy, and fear is on every side.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Gird thee with <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, O daughter of my people, and sprinkle thee with ashes: make thee mourning as for an only son, a bitter lamentation, because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> I have set thee for a strong trier among my people: and thou shalt <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> their way.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> All these princes go out of the way, they walk deceitfully, they are brass and iron: they are all corrupted.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> The bellows have failed, the lead is consumed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Call them reprobate silver, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath rejected them.</span></blockquote>
