<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Make your ways and your doings <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and I will dwell with you in this place.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> I will dwell with you in this place: in the land, which I gave to your fathers from the beginning and for evermore.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And you have come, and stood before me in this house, in which my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is called upon, and have said: We are delivered, because we have done all these abominations.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Is this house then, in which my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> hath been called upon, in your eyes become a den of robbers? I, I am he: I have seen it, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I will cast you away from before my face, as I have cast away all your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For I spoke not to your fathers, and I commanded them not, in the day that I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, concerning the matter of burnt <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>I commanded them not...</strong> Viz., such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at this time offered, without <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; which was the thing principally commanded: so that in comparison with it, the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> was of small account.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But this thing I commanded them, saying: Hearken to my voice, and I will be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you shall be my people: and walk ye in all the way that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> From the day that their fathers came out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, even to this day.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Because the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in my eyes, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.
