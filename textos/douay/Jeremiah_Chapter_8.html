<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> At that time, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, they shall cast out the bones of the kings of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and the bones of the princes thereof, and the bones of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the bones of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the bones of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, out of their graves.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they shall spread them abroad to the sun, and the moon, and all the host of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, whom they have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>, and whom they have served, and after whom have walked, and whom they have sought, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>: they shall not be gathered, and they shall not be <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->buried<!--</a>-->: they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth.</span><br />

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And thou shalt say to them:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Shall not he that falleth, rise again? and he that is turned away, shall he not turn again?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Why then is this people in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> turned away with a stubborn revolting? they have laid hold on lying, and have refused to return.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I attended, and hearkened; no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> speaketh what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, there is none that doth <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, saying: What have I done? They are all turned to their own course, as a horse rushing to the battle.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The kite in the air hath <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> her time: the turtle, and the swallow, and the stork have observed the time of their coming: but my people have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> How do you say: We are wise, and the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is with us? Indeed the lying pens of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> hath wrought falsehood.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are confounded, they are dismayed, and taken: for they have cast away the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, and there is no wisdom in them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore will I give their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to strangers, their fields to others for an inheritance: because from the least even to the greatest all follow <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> even to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> all deal deceitfully.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people disgracefully, saying: Peace, peace: when there was no peace.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They are confounded, because they have committed abomination: yea rather they are not confounded with confusion, and they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> how to blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall fall, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Gathering I will gather them together, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, there is no grape on the vines, and there are no figs on the fig tree, the leaf is fallen: and I have given them the things that are passed away.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced city, and let us be silent there: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> hath put us to silence, and hath given us water of gall to drink: for we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> We looked for peace and no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> came: for a time of healing, and behold fear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The snorting of his horses was heard from <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, all the land was moved at the sound of the neighing of his warriors: and they came and devoured the land, and all that was in it: the city and its inhabitants.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which there is no charm: and they shall bite you, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> My sorrow is above sorrow, my heart mourneth within me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Behold the voice of the daughter of my people from a far country: Is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in Sion, or is not her king in her? why then have they provoked me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> with their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and strange vanities?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For the affliction of the daughter of my people I am afflicted, and made sorrowful, astonishment hath taken hold on me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Is there no balm in Galaad? or is there no physician there? Why then is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed?</span></blockquote>
