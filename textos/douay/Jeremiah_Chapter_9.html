<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Who will give me in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> a lodging place of wayfaring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and I will leave my people, and depart from them? because they are all adulterers, an assembly of transgressors.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they have bent their tongue, as a bow, for lies, and not for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: they have strengthened themselves upon the earth, for they have proceeded from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and me they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take heed of his neighbour, and let him not trust in any brother of his: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thy habitation is in the midst of <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>: through <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a> they have refused to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Their tongue is a piercing arrow, it hath spoken <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>: with his mouth one speaketh peace with his friend, and secretly he lieth in wait for him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Shall I not visit them for these things, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>? or shall not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be revenged on such a nation?</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I will make <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to be heaps of sand, and dens of dragons: and I will make the cities of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> desolate, for want of an inhabitant.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Who is the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that may understand this, and to whom the word of the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may come that he may declare this, why the land hath perished, and is burnt up like a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, which none passeth through?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: Because they have forsaken my law, which I gave them, and have not heard my voice, and have not walked in it.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Let them hasten and take up a lamentation for us: let our eyes shed tears, and our eyelids run down with waters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Sion: How are we wasted and greatly confounded? because we have left the land, because our dwellings are cast down.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Hear therefore, ye <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>: and let your ears receive the word of his mouth: and teach your daughters wailing: and every one her neighbour mourning.</span><br />
