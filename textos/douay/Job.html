<h1>Job</h1>

<p>This book takes its name from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of whom it treats: who, according to the more probable opinion, was of the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">race of Esau</a>; and the same as Jobab, king of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, mentioned in <a href="../douay/gen036.htm#verse33">Genesis 36:33</a>. It is uncertain who was the writer of it. Some attribute it to Job himself; others to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or some one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> it is written in verse, from the beginning of the <a href="../douay/job003.htm">third chapter</a> to the <a href="../douay/job042.htm">forty-second chapter</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">JOB</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)
