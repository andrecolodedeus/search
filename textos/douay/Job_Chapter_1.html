<div class="h1a">Job's virtue and riches. Satan by permission from God strips him of all his substance. His patience.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> There was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the land of Hus, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Job, and that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was simple and upright, and fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hus...</strong> The land of Hus was a part of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>; as appears from <a href="../douay/lam004.htm#verse21">Lamentations 4:21</a>. Ibid. <strong>Simple...</strong> That is, innocent, sincere, and without guile.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> exceedingly great: and this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was great among all the people of the east.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them. <span class="stiki"><strong>And made a feast by houses...</strong> That is, each made a feast in his own house and had his day, inviting the others, and their sisters.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> them: and rising up early, offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their hearts. So did Job all days. <span class="stiki"><strong>Blessed...</strong> For greater horror of the very thought of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> both here and <a href="../douay/job001.htm#verse11">verse 11</a>, and in <a href="../douay/job002.htm#verse5">2:5 and 9</a>, uses the word <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> to signify its contrary.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now on a certain day, when the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came to stand before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> also was present among them. <span class="stiki"><strong>The sons of God...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. -- Ibid. <strong>Satan also, etc...</strong> This passage represents to us in a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a>, accommodated to the ways and understandings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, (1) The restless endeavours of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> against the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; (2) That he can do nothing without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> permission; (3) That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not permit him to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> them above their strength: but assists them by his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> in such manner, that the vain efforts of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">enemy</a> only serve to illustrate their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and increase their <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> answering, said: Doth Job fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in vain?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee not to thy face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> went forth from the presence of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fell from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> A <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> wind came on a sudden from the side of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath taken away: as it hath pleased the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, so is it done: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> In all these things Job <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
