<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Who cometh forth like a flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in the same state.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And dost thou think it meet to open thy eyes upon such an one, and to bring him into judgment with thee?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Who can make him clean that is conceived of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> seed? is it not thou who only art?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The days of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are short, and the number of his months is with thee: thou hast appointed his bounds which cannot be passed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Depart a little from him, that he may rest until his wished for day come, as that of the hireling.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> A tree hath hope: if it be cut, it growth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> If its roots be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> At the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when he shall be dead, and stripped and consumed, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you where is he?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> As if the waters should depart out of the sea, and an emptied river should be dried up;</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when he is fallen asleep shall not <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a>; till the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> be broken, he shall not awake, nor rise up out of his sleep.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell, and hide me till thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me? <span class="stiki"><strong>That thou mayst protect me in hell...</strong> That is, in the <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">state of the dead</a>; and in the place where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are kept waiting for their <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>.</span></span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thou shalt call me, and I will answer thee: to the work of thy hands thou shalt reach out thy right hand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thou indeed hast numbered my steps, but spare my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Thou hast sealed up my offences as it were in a bag, but hast cured my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> A mountain falling cometh to nought, and a rock is removed out of its place.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Waters wear away the stones, and with inundation the ground by little and little is washed away: so in like manner thou shalt destroy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Thou hast strengthened him for a little while, that he may pass away for ever: thou shalt change his face, and shalt send him away.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Whether his children come to honour or dishonour, he shall not understand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But yet his flesh, while he shall live, shall have pain, and his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall mourn over him.</span></blockquote>
