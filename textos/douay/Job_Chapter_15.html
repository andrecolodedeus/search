<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Eliphaz the Themanite, answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Will a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> answer as if he were speaking in the wind, and fill his stomach with burning heat?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thou reprovest him by words, who is not equal to thee, and thou speakest that which is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> As much as is in thee, thou hast made void fear, and hast taken away <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> from before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thou hast made void fear...</strong> That is, cast off the fear of offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> hath taught thy mouth, and thou imitatest the tongue of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thy own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I: and thy own lips shall answer thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Art thou the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was born, or wast thou made before the hills?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Hast thou heard <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> counsel, and shall his wisdom be inferior to thee?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> What knowest thou that we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of? what dost thou understand that we know not?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> There are with us also aged and ancient <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, much elder than thy fathers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Is it a great matter that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should comfort thee? but thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> words hinder this.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Why doth thy heart elevate thee, and why dost thou stare with thy eyes, as if they were thinking great things?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Why doth thy spirit swell against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to utter such words out of thy mouth?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> What is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that he should be without spot, and he that is born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that he should appear <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Behold among his saints none is unchangeable, and the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> are not pure in his sight.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> How much more is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> abominable, and unprofitable, who drinketh <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> like water?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I will show thee, hear me: and I will tell thee what I have seen.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> confess and hide not their fathers. <span class="stiki"><strong>Wise men confess and hide not their fathers...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and documents they have received from their fathers they are not ashamed to own.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger hath passed among them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> all his days, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The sound of dread is always in his ears: and when there is peace, he always suspecteth treason.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not that he may return from darkness to light, looking round about for the sword on every side.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> When he moveth himself to seek bread, he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Tribulation shall terrify him, and distress shall surround him, as a king that is prepared for the battle.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For he hath stretched out his hand against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hath strengthened himself against the Almighty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> He hath run against him with his neck raised up, and is armed with a fat neck.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Fatness hath covered his face, and the fat hangeth down on his sides.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> He hath dwelt in desolate cities, and in <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> houses that are reduced into heaps.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> He shall not be enriched, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he push his root in the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> He shall not depart out of darkness: the flame shall dry up his branches, and he shall be taken away by the breath of his own mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> He shall not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, being vainly deceived by error, that he may be <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a> with any price.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Before his days be full he shall perish: and his hands shall wither away.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> He shall be blasted as a vine when its grapes are in the first flower, and as an olive tree that casteth its flower.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> For the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrite</a> is barren, and fire shall devour their tabernacles, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to take <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> He hath conceived sorrow, and hath brought forth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and his womb prepareth deceits.</span></blockquote>
