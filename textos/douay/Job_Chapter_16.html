<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Job answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I have often heard such things as these: you are all troublesome comforters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Shall windy words have no end? or is it any trouble to thee to speak?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I also could speak like you: and would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were for my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I would comfort you also with words, and would wag my head over you.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would move my lips, as sparing you.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But what shall I do? If I speak, my pain will not rest: and if I hold my peace, it will not depart from me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But now my sorrow hath oppressed me, and all my limbs are brought to nothing.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> My wrinkles bear witness against me, and a false speaker riseth up against my face, contradicting me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He hath gathered together his fury against me, and threatening me he hath gnashed with his teeth upon me: my enemy hath beheld me with terrible eyes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> They have opened their mouths upon me, and reproaching me they have struck me on the cheek, they are filled with my pains.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath shut me up with the unjust <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and hath delivered me into the hands of the wicked.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I that was formerly so wealthy, am all on a sudden broken to pieces: he hath taken me by my neck, he hath broken me, and hath set me up to be his mark.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He hath compassed me round about with his lances, he hath wounded my loins, he hath not spared, and hath poured out my bowels on the earth,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He hath torn me with wound upon wound, he hath rushed in upon me like a giant.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I have sowed <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a> upon my skin, and have covered my flesh with ashes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> My face is swollen with weeping, and my eyelids are dim.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> These things have I suffered without the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of my hand, when I offered pure <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> O earth, cover not thou my blood, neither let my cry find a hiding place in thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For behold my witness is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and he that knoweth my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is on high.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> My friends are full of words: my eye poureth out tears to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And O that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might so be judged with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> is judged with his companion!</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For behold short years pass away, and I am walking in a path by which I shall not return.</span></blockquote>
