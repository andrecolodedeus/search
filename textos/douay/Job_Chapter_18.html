<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> How long will you throw out words? understand first, and so let us speak.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Why are we reputed as beasts, and counted vile before you?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Thou that destroyest thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in thy fury, shall the earth be forsaken for thee, and shall rocks be removed out of their place?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Shall not the light of the wicked be extinguished, and the flame of his fire not shine?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and the lamp that is over him, shall be put out.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The step of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down headlong.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For he hath thrust his feet into a net, and walketh in its meshes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The sole of his foot shall be held in a snare, and thirst shall burn against him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> A gin is hidden for him in the earth, and his trap upon the path.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Fears shall terrify him on every side, and shall entangle his feet.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Let his strength be wasted with famine, and let hunger invade his ribs.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Let it devour the beauty of his skin, let the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> death consume his arms.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Let his confidence be rooted out of his tabernacle, and let destruction tread upon him like a king.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Let the companions of him that is not, dwell in his tabernacle, let brimstone be sprinkled in his tent.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Let his roots be dried up beneath, and his harvest destroyed above.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Let the memory of him perish from the earth, and let not his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> be renowned in the streets.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He shall drive him out of light into darkness, and shall remove him out of the world.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> His seed shall not subsist, nor his offspring among his people, nor any remnants in his country.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, and horror shall fall upon them that went before.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> These then are the tabernacles of the wicked, and this the place of him that knoweth not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></blockquote>
