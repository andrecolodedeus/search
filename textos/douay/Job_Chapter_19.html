<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Job answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> How long do you afflict my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and break me in pieces with words?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Behold, these ten times you confound me, and are not ashamed to oppress me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For if I have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> shall be with me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But you set yourselves up against me, and reprove me with my reproaches.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> At least now understand, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not afflicted me with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his scourges. <span class="stiki"><strong>With an equal judgment...</strong> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> explains these words thus: Job being a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> considering his own life, thought that his affliction was greater than his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> deserved: and in that respect, that the punishment was not equal, yet it was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, as coming from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives a crown of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to those who suffer for righteousness' sake, and proves the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> with tribulations, as gold is tried by fire.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Behold I shall cry suffering <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and no one will hear: I shall cry aloud, and there is none to judge.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass, and in my way he hath set darkness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He hath stripped me of my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and hath taken the crown from my head.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and he hath taken away my hope, as from a tree that is plucked up.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is kindled against me, and he hath counted me as his enemy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> His troops have come together, and have made themselves a way by me, and have besieged my tabernacle round about.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance like strangers have departed from me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> My kinsmen have forsaken me, and they that knew me, have forgotten me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> They that dwell in my house, and my maidservants have counted me as a stranger, and I have been like an alien in their eyes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer, I entreated him with my own mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> My wife hath abhorred my breath, and I entreated the children of my womb.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Even fools <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> me, and when I was gone from them, they spoke against me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> They that were sometime my counsellors, have abhorred me: and he whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> most is turned against me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The flesh being consumed, my bone hath cleaved to my skin, and nothing but lips are left about my teeth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath touched me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Why do you persecute me as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and glut yourselves with my flesh?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Who will grant me that my words may be written? who will grant me that they may be marked down in a book?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> With an iron pen and in a plate of lead, or else be graven with an instrument in flint stone?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom. <span class="stiki">The previous three verses (25-27) show Job's explicit <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>, and also of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the flesh</a>, not as one tree riseth in place of another, but that the selfsame flesh shall rise at the last day, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, changed in quality but not in <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>, every one to receive sentence according to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> in this life.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Why then do you say now: Let us persecute him, and let us find occasion of word against him?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Flee then from the face of the sword, for the sword is the revenger of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>: and know ye that there is a judgment.</span></blockquote>
