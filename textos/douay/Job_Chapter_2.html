<h1>Job Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Satan, by God's permission, strikes Job with ulcers from head to foot: his patience is still invincible.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came, and stood before the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> came amongst them, and stood in his sight,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> That the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: Whence comest thou? And he answered, and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> simple and upright, and fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and still keeping his innocence? But thou hast moved me against him, that I should afflict him without cause.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> answered, and said: Skin for skin; and all that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath, he will give for his life:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and then thou shalt see that he will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee to thy face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: Behold, he is in thy hand, but yet save his life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> went forth from the presence of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: If we have received <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things at the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why should we not receive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? In all these things Job did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with his lips.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now when Job's three friends heard all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Themanite, and Baldad, the Suhite, and Sophar, the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, and comfort him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out, they wept, and rending their garments, they sprinkled dust upon their heads toward <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they sat with him on the ground seven day and seven nights and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great.</span></p>
