<h1>Job Chapter 20</h1>
<div class="h1a">Sophar declares the shortness of the prosperity of the wicked: and their sudden downfall.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Therefore various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind is hurried away to different things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The doctrine with which thou reprovest me, I will hear, and the spirit of my understanding shall answer for me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> This I know from the beginning, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was placed upon the earth,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> That the praise of the wicked is short, and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrite</a> but for a moment.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> If his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> mount up even to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and his head touch the clouds:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> In the end he shall be destroyed like a dunghill, and they that had seen him, shall say: Where is he?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> As a dream that fleeth away he shall not be found, he shall pass as a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of the night:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The eyes that had seen him, shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more behold him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> His children shall be oppressed with want, and his hands shall render to him his sorrow.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> His bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth, and they shall sleep with him in the dust.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For when <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shall be sweet in his mouth, he will hide it under his tongue.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He will spare it, and not leave it, and will hide it in his throat.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> His bread in his belly shall be turned into the gall of asps within him,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The riches which he hath swallowed, he shall vomit up, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall draw them out of his belly.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He shall suck the head of asps, and the viper's tongue shall kill him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Let him not see the streams of the river, the brooks of honey and of butter.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He shall be punished for all that he did, and yet shall not be consumed: according to the multitude of his devices so also shall he suffer. <span class="stiki"><strong>According to the multitude of his devices...</strong> That is, his stratagems to gratify his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and to oppress and destroy the poor.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Because he broke in and stripped the poor: he hath <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> taken away a house which he did not build.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And yet his belly was not filled: and when he hath the things he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a>, he shall not be able to possess them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> There was nothing left of his meat, and therefore nothing shall continue of his goods:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> When he shall be filled, he shall be straitened, he shall burn, and every sorrow shall fall upon him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> May his belly be filled, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may send forth the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of his indignation upon him, and rain down his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He shall flee from weapons of iron, and shall fall upon a bow of brass.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The sword is drawn out, and cometh forth from its scabbard, and glittereth in his bitterness: the terrible ones shall go and come upon him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> All darkness is hid in his secret places: a fire that is not kindled shall devour him, he shall be afflicted when left in his tabernacle.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> The <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> shall reveal his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and the earth shall rise up against him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> The offspring of his house shall be exposed, he shall be pulled down in the day of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> This is the portion of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the inheritance of his doings from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></blockquote>
