<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Job answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hear, I beseech you, my words, and do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Suffer me, and I will speak, and after, if you please, laugh at my words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Is my debate against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that I should not have <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> reason to be troubled?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Hearken to me and be astonished, and lay your finger on your mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> As for me, when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Why then do the wicked live, are they advanced, and strengthened with riches?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Their seed continueth before them, a multitude of kinsmen, and of children's children in their sight.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Their houses are secure and peaceable, and the rod of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not upon them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Their cattle have conceived, and failed not: their cow has calved, and is not deprived of her fruit.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Their little ones go out like a flock, and their children <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dance and play</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They take the timbrel, and the harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment they go down to hell.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Who have said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what doth it profit us if we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to him?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Yet because their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are not in their hand, may the counsel of the wicked be far from me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> How often shall the lamp of the wicked be put out, and a deluge come upon them, and he shall distribute the sorrows of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> They shall be as chaff before the face of the wind, and as ashes which the whirlwind scattereth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall lay up the sorrow of the father for his children: and when he shall repay, then shall he know.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> His eyes shall see his own destruction, and he shall drink of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the Almighty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For what is it to him what befalleth his house after him: and if the number of his months be diminished by one half?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Shall any one teach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knowledge, who judgeth those that are high?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> One <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dieth strong, and hale, rich and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> His bowels are full of fat, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But another dieth in bitterness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without any riches:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And yet they shall sleep together in the dust, and worms shall cover them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Surely I know your thoughts, and your <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgments against me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For you say: Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Ask any one of them that go by the way, and you shall perceive that he knoweth these same things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Because the wicked <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is reserved to the day of destruction, and he shall be brought to the day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Who shall reprove his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> He shall be brought to the graves, and shall watch in the heap of the dead.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> He hath been acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus, and he shall draw every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after him, and there are innumerable before him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> word, which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> has here rendered by the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Cocytus, (which the poets represent as a river in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>), signifies a valley or a torrent: and in this place, is taken for the low region of death and hell: which willingly, as it were, receives the wicked at their death: who are ushered in by innumerable others that have gone before them; and are followed by multitudes above number.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> How then do ye comfort me in vain, whereas your answer is shown to be repugnant to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</span></blockquote>
