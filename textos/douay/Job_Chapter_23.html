<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Job answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For he is alone, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can turn away his thought: and whatsoever his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath desired, that hath he done.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face.</span></blockquote>
