<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Some have removed landmarks, have taken away flocks by force, and fed them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> They have driven away the ass of the fatherless, and have taken away the widow's ox for a pledge.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> They have overturned the way of the poor, and have oppressed together the meek of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Others like wild asses in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> go forth to their work: by watching for a prey they get bread for their children.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> They reap the field that is not their own, and gather the vintage of his vineyard whom by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> they have oppressed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They send <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> away naked, taking away their clothes who have no covering in the cold:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Who are wet, with the showers of the mountains, and having no covering embrace the stones.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> They have <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> robbed the fatherless, and stripped the poor common people.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> From the naked and them that go without clothing, and from the hungry they have taken away the ears of corn.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> They have taken their rest at noon among the stores of them, who after having trodden the winepresses suffer thirst.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Out of the cities they have made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to groan, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the wounded hath cried out, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not suffer it to pass unrevenged.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> They have been rebellious to the light, they have not known his ways, neither have they returned by his paths.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The murderer riseth at the very break of day, he killeth the needy, and the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but in the night he will be as a thief.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The eye of the adulterer observeth darkness, saying: No eye shall see me: and he will cover his face.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He diggeth through houses in the dark, as in the day they had appointed for themselves, and they have not known the light.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> If the morning suddenly appear, it is to them the shadow of death: and they walk in darkness as if it were in light.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He is light upon the face of the water: <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> be his portion on the earth, let him not walk by the way of the vineyards.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Let him pass from the snow waters to excessive heat, and his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even to hell.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Let mercy forget him: may worms be his sweetness: let him be remembered no more, but be broken in pieces as an unfruitful tree.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For he hath fed the barren that beareth not, and to the widow he hath done no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He hath pulled down the strong by his might: and when he standeth up, he shall not trust to his life.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given him place for <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, and he abuseth it unto <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: but his eyes are upon his ways.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> They are lifted up for a little while and shall not stand, and shall be brought down as all things, and shall be taken away, and as the tops of the ears of corn they shall be broken.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And if it be not so, who can convince me that I have lied, and set my words before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span></blockquote>
