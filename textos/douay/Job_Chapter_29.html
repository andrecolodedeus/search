<div class="h1a">Job relates his former happiness, and the respect that all men showed him.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Job also added, taking up his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Who will grant me, that I might be according to the months past, according to the days in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> kept me?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> When his lamp shined over my head, and I walked by his light in darkness?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> As I was in the days of my youth, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was secretly in my tabernacle?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> When the Almighty was with me: and my servants round about me?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> When I <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed my feet</a> with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> When I went out to the gate of the city, and in the street they prepared me a chair?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> rose up and stood.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The princes ceased to speak, and laid the finger on their mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The rulers held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to their throat.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The ear that heard me <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> me, and the eye that saw me gave witness to me:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Because I had delivered the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that cried out; and the fatherless, that had no helper.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I comforted the heart of the widow.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I was clad with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and I clothed myself with my judgment, as with a robe and a diadem.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I was the father of the poor: and the cause which I knew not, I searched out most diligently.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I broke the jaws of the wicked <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and out of his teeth I took away the prey.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I said: I shall die in my nest, and as a palm tree shall multiply my days.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> My root is opened beside the waters, and dew shall continue in my harvest.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall always be renewed, and my bow in my hand shall be repaired.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> They that heard me, waited for my sentence, and being attentive held their peace at my counsel.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> To my words they durst add nothing, and my speech dropped upon them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their mouth as for a latter shower.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> If at any time I laughed on them, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, and the light of my countenance fell not on earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> If I had a mind to go to them, I sat first, and when I sat as a king, with his army standing about him, yet I was a comforter of them that mourned.</span></blockquote>
