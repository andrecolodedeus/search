<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After this, Job opened his mouth, and <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> his day, <span class="stiki"><strong>Cursed his day...</strong> Job <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> the day of his birth, not by way of wishing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to any thing of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">God's creation</a>; but only to express in a stronger manner his sense of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> miseries in general, and of his own calamities in particular.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Let that day be turned into darkness, let not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Let darkness, and the shadow of death, cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Let them <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> it who <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> the day, who are ready to raise up a leviathan:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light, and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> from my eyes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Why did I not die in the womb? why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Or with princes, that possess gold, and fill their houses with silver:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Or as a hidden untimely birth, I should not be; or as they that, being conceived, have not seen the light.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> To a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose way is hidden, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath surrounded him with darkness?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For the fear which I feared, hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Have I not dissembled? have I not kept silence? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.</span></blockquote>
