<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But now the younger in time scorn me, whose fathers I would not have set with the dogs of my flock: <span class="stiki"><strong>But now the younger in time...</strong> That is, younger than I am, and as it were obscure, when I was conspicuous and in magnificence; they now look down on me.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing, and they were thought unworthy of life itself.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Barren with want and hunger, who gnawed in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, disfigured with calamity and misery.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they ate grass, and barks of trees, and the root of junipers was their food.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Who snatched up these things out of the valleys, and when they had found any of them, they ran to them with a cry.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> They dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert places</a> of torrents, and in caves of earth, or upon the gravel.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They pleased themselves among these kind of things, and counted it delightful to be under the briers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The children of foolish and base <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and not appearing at all upon the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Now I am turned into their song, and am become their byword.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They abhor me, and flee far from me, and are not afraid to spit in my face.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For he hath opened his quiver, and hath afflicted me, and hath put a bridle into my mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> At the right hand of my rising, my calamities forthwith arose: they have overthrown my feet, and have overwhelmed me with their paths as with waves.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> They have destroyed my ways, they have lain in wait against me, and they have prevailed, and there was none to help.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> They have rushed in upon me, as when a wall is broken, and a gate opened, and have rolled themselves down to my miseries.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I am brought to nothing: as a wind thou hast taken away my desire: and my prosperity hath passed away like a cloud.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And now my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> fadeth within myself, and the days of affliction possess me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> In the night my bone is pierced with sorrows: and they that feed upon me, do not sleep.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> With the multitude of them my garment is consumed, and they have girded me about, as with the collar of my coat.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> I am compared to dirt, and am likened to embers and ashes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> I cry to thee, and thou hearest me not: I stand up, and thou dost not regard me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Thou art changed to be cruel toward me, and in the hardness of thy hand thou art against me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Thou hast lifted me up, and set me as it were upon the wind, and thou hast mightily dashed me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> I know that thou wilt deliver me to death, where a house is appointed for every one that liveth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But yet thou stretchest not forth thy hand to their consumption: and if they shall fall down thou wilt save.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> I wept heretofore for him that was afflicted, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had compassion on the poor.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> I expected <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are come upon me: I waited for light, and darkness broke out.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> My inner parts have boiled without any rest, the days of affliction have prevented me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> I went mourning without indignation; I rose up, and cried in the crowd.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> I was the brother of dragons, and companion of ostriches. <span class="stiki"><strong>Brother of dragons, etc...</strong> Imitating these creatures in their lamentable noise.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> My skin is become black upon me, and my bones are dried up with heat.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> My harp is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of those that weep.</span></blockquote>
