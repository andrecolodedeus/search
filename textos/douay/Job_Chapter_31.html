<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For what part should <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Let him weigh me in a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> balance, and let <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> know my simplicity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then let me sow and let another reap: and let my offspring be rooted out.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If my heart hath been deceived upon a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and if I have laid wait at my friend's door:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> lie with her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> It is a fire that devoureth even to <a href="../cathen/01005a.htm">destruction</a>, and rooteth up all things that spring.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> If I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For what shall I do when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> (For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother's womb:)</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> If I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that had no covering:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> If his sides have not <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw myself superior in the gate:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with its bones be broken.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For I have always feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was unable to bear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> If I beheld the sun when it shined and the moon going in brightness: <span class="stiki"><strong>If I beheld the sun, etc...</strong> If I behold the sun and moon with admiration, knowing them to be <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and governed by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I call on my adversaries to produce any thing against me, whereby I could be charged with <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipping</a> the sun or moon.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> my hand with, my mouth:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Which is a very great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and a denial against the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> If I have been glad at the downfall of him that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me, and have rejoiced that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had found him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For I have not given my mouth to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by wishing a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> If the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> If as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> I have hid my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and have concealed my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> in my bosom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Who would grant me a hearing, that the Almighty may hear my desire: and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have afflicted the son of the tillers thereof:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley.
