<h1>Job Chapter 32</h1>
<div class="h1a">Eliu is angry with Job and his friends. He boasts of himself.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> So these three <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> ceased to answer Job, because he seemed <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> to himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite of the kindred of Ram, was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and was moved to indignation: now he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against Job, because he said he was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his friends, because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> So Eliu waited while Job was speaking because they were his elders that were speaking.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, and said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> I am younger in days, and you are more ancient, therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to show you my opinion.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But, as I see, there is a spirit in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> They that are aged are not the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither do the ancients understand judgment.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore I will speak: Hearken to me, I also will show you my wisdom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered: but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Lest you should say: We have found wisdom, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath cast him down, not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken: they stood, and answered no more:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I also will answer my part, and will show my knowledge.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> I will speak and take breath a little: I will open my lips, and will answer.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I will not accept the person of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and I will not level <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>I will not level God with man...</strong> Here Eliu considers that Job hath put himself on a level with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the manner he assumed to justify his own life in speaking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as if he spoke to an equal: Eliu expresses in the following <a href="../douay/job032.htm#verse22">verse 22</a> his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">punishment hereafter</a> for such an attempt.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away.</span></blockquote>
