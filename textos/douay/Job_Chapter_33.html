<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my jaws.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a pure sentence.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a> made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Behold <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath made me as well as thee, and of the same clay I also was formed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my eloquence be burdensome to thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now thou hast said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> I am clean, and without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: I am unspotted, and there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> in me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath counted me for his enemy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all my paths.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified: I will answer thee, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is greater than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not answered thee to all words?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they are sleeping in their beds:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then he openeth the ears of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> That he may withdraw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Rescuing his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from corruption: and his life from passing to the sword.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his bones to wither.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the meat which before he desired.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were covered shall be made bare.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to the destroyers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> If there shall be an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> uprightness,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He shall have mercy on him, and shall say: Deliver him, that he may not go down to corruption: I have found wherein I may be merciful to him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> His flesh is consumed with punishments, let him return to the days of his youth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> He shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he will be gracious to him: and he shall see his face with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and he will render to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He shall look upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and shall say: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and indeed I have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> He hath delivered his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from going into destruction, that it may live and see the light.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Behold, all these things <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> worketh three times within every one.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> That he may withdraw their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from corruption, and enlighten them with the light of the living.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Attend, Job, and hearken to me, and hold thy peace, whilst I speak.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But if thou hast any thing to say, answer me, speak: for I would have thee to appear <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And if thou have not, hear me: hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</span></blockquote>
