<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Eliu continued his discourse, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hear ye, wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For Job hath said: I am <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath overthrown my judgment.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For in judging me there is a lie: my arrow is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Who goeth in company with them that work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and walketh with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For he hath said: Man shall not please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although he run with him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Therefore, ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of understanding, hear me: far from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> from the Almighty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For he will render to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For in very deed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath he set over the world which he made?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> All flesh shall perish together, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall return into ashes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Can he be healed that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Who saith to the king: Thou art an apostate: who calleth rulers ungodly:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Who accepteth not the persons of princes: nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for all are the work of his hands.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> without hand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For his eyes are upon the ways of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and he considereth all their steps.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For it is no longer in the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to enter into judgment with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For he knoweth their works: and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> He hath struck them, as being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, in open sight.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Who maketh a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is a <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrite</a> to reign for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Seeing then I have spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> If I have erred, teach thou me: if I have spoken <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, I will add no more.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Doth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I: but if thou know any thing better, speak.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Let <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of understanding speak to me, and let a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hearken to me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> My father, let Job be tried even to the end: cease not from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Because he addeth <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> upon his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us: and then let him provoke <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to judgment with his speeches.</span></blockquote>
