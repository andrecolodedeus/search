<div class="h1a">Eliu proceeds in setting forth the justice and power of God.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Eliu also proceeded, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Suffer me a little, and I will show thee: for I have yet somewhat to speak in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> behalf.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For indeed my words are without a lie, and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not cast away the mighty, whereas he himself also is mighty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But he saveth not the wicked, and he giveth judgment to the poor.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He will not take away his eyes from the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and he placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are exalted.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the cords of poverty:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He shall show them their works, and their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deeds, because they have been <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He also shall open their ear, to correct them: and shall speak, that they may return from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If they shall hear and observe, they shall accomplish their days in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and their years in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and shall be consumed in folly.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Dissemblers and crafty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> prove the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither shall they cry when they are bound.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall die in a storm, and their life among the effeminate.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He shall deliver the poor out of his distress, and shall open his ear in affliction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth, and which hath no foundation under it: and the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness. <span class="stiki"><strong>Out of the narrow mouth...</strong> That is, out of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, whose entrance is narrow, and its depth bottomless; but figuratively meant here, that is, from his miseries and calamity to be restored to his former state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore let not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> overcome thee to oppress any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Lay down thy greatness without tribulation, and all the mighty of strength.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Prolong not the night that people may come up for them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Beware thou turn not aside to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>: for this thou hast begun to follow after misery. <span class="stiki"><strong>For this thou hast begun to follow after misery...</strong> Eliu charges Job, that notwithstanding his misery, he does not fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as he ought: but in his judgment, falls into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Behold, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is high in his strength, and none is like him among the lawgivers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Who can search out his ways? or who can say to him: Thou hast wrought <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Remember that thou knowest not his work, concerning which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have sung.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> All <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> see him, every one beholdeth afar off.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Behold, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is great, exceeding our knowledge: the number of his years is inestimable.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He lifteth up the drops of rain, and poureth out showers like floods:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Which flow from the clouds that cover all above.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> If he will spread out clouds as his tent,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And lighten with his light from above, he shall cover also the ends of the sea.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For by these he judgeth people, and giveth food to many mortals.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> In his hands he hideth the light, and commandeth it to come again.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> He showeth his friend concerning it, that it is his possession, and that he may come up to it.</span></blockquote>
