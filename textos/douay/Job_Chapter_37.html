<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hear ye attentively the terror of his voice, and the sound that cometh out of his mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He beholdeth under all the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and his light is upon the ends of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> After it a noise shall roar, he shall thunder with the voice of his majesty, and shall not be found out, when his voice shall be heard.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall thunder wonderfully with his voice, he that doth great and unsearchable things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth, and the winter rain, and the shower of his strength.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He sealeth up the hand of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that every one may know his works. <span class="stiki"><strong>He sealeth up, etc...</strong> When he sends those showers of his strength, that is, those storms of rain, he seals up, that is, he shuts up the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from their usual works abroad, and confines them within doors, to consider his works; or to forecast their works, that is, what they themselves are to do.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then the beast shall go into his covert, and shall abide in his den.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Out of the inner parts shall a tempest come, and cold out of the <a href="../cathen/02029a.htm#mezarim">north</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bloweth there cometh frost, and again the waters are poured out abundantly.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Corn desireth clouds, and the clouds spread their light:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Which go round about, whithersoever the will of him that governeth them shall lead them, to whatsoever he shall command them upon the face of the whole earth:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Whether in one tribe, or in his own land, or in what place soever of his mercy he shall command them to be found.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Dost thou know when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commanded the rains, to show his light of his clouds?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Knowest thou the great paths of the clouds, and the perfect knowledges?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Are not thy garments hot, when the south wind blows upon the earth?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Thou perhaps hast made the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> with him, which are most strong, as if they were of molten brass.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Who shall tell him the things I speak? even if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall speak, he shall be swallowed up. <span class="stiki"><strong>He shall be swallowed up...</strong> All that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can say when he speaks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is so little and inconsiderable in comparison with the subject, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is lost, and as it were swallowed up in so immense an ocean.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But now they see not the light: the air on a sudden shall be thickened into clouds, and the wind shall pass and drive them away.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Cold cometh out of the north, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> praise with fear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> We cannot find him worthily: he is great in strength, and in judgment, and in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and he is ineffable.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall fear him, and all that seem to themselves to be wise, shall not dare to behold him.</span></blockquote>
