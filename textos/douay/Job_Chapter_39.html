<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Knowest thou the time when the wild goats bring forth among the rocks, or hast thou observed the hinds when they fawn?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hast thou numbered the months of their conceiving, or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> They bow themselves to bring forth young, and they cast them, and send forth roarings.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Their young are weaned and go to feed: they go forth, and return not to them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Who hath sent out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his bonds?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> To whom I have given a house in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and his dwellings in the barren land.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He scorneth the multitude of the city, he heareth not the cry of the driver.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He looketh round about the mountains of his pasture, and seeketh for every green thing,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Shall the rhinoceros be willing to serve thee, or will he stay at thy crib?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Canst thou bind the rhinoceros with thy thong to plough, or will he break the clods of the valleys after thee?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Wilt thou have confidence in his great strength, and leave thy labours to him?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wilt thou trust him that he will render thee the seed, and gather it into thy barnfloor?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron, and of the hawk.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> When she leaveth her eggs on the earth, thou perhaps wilt warm them in the dust.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> She forgetteth that the foot may tread upon them, or that the beasts of the field may break them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers, she hath laboured in vain, no fear constraining her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he given her understanding.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> When time shall be, she setteth up her wings on high: she scorneth the horse and his rider.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Wilt thou give strength to the horse or clothe his neck with neighing?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Wilt thou lift him up like the locusts? the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his nostrils is terror.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> He breaketh up the earth with his hoof, he pranceth boldly, he goeth forward to meet armed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> fear, he turneth not his back to the sword.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Above him shall the quiver rattle, the spear and shield shall glitter.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground, neither doth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> When he heareth the trumpet he saith: Ha, ha: he smelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, and the shouting of the army.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her wings to the south?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Will the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest in high places?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> She abideth among the rocks, and dwelleth among cragged flints, and stony hills, where there is no access.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> From thence she looketh for the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Her young ones shall suck up blood: and wheresoever the carcass shall be, she is immediately there.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> went on, and said to Job:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Shall he that contendeth with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be so easily silenced? surely he that reproveth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ought to answer him.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Then Job answered the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> What can I answer, who hath spoken inconsiderately? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. <span class="stiki"><strong>Spoken inconsiderately...</strong> If we discuss all Job's words (saith <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>), we shall find nothing impiously spoken; as may be gathered from the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> himself (<a href="../douay/job042.htm#verse7">Job 42:7-8</a>); but what was reprehensible in him, was the manner of expressing himself at times, speaking too much of his own affliction, and too little of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> towards him, which here he acknowledges as inconsiderate.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said: and another, to which I will add no more.</span></blockquote>
