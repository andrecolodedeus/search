<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Gird up thy loins like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Wilt thou make void my judgment: and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And hast thou an arm like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high, and be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and put on goodly garments.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Scatter the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Look on all that are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox. <span class="stiki"><strong>Behemoth...</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, <em>behema</em>, which signifies in general an animal; but many authors explain, that here it is put for the elephant.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He setteth up his tail like a <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a>, the sinews of his testicles are wrapped together.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of iron.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He is the beginning of the ways of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made him, he will apply his sword. <span class="stiki"><strong>He will apply his sword...</strong> This text is variously explained: some explain the sword, the horn given to the animal for his defence: others, the power that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given to the animal for his defence: others, the power that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to slay him, notwithstanding his great size and strength.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> To him the mountains bring forth grass: there all the beasts of the field shall play.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in moist places.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall compass him about.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder: and he trusteth that the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> may run into his mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through his nostrils with stakes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie his tongue with a cord? <span class="stiki"><strong>Leviathan...</strong> The whale or some sea monster.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with a buckle?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to thee?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be a servant for ever,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy handmaids?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall merchants divide him?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with his head?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Lay thy hand upon him: remember the battle, and speak no more.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall be cast down.</span></blockquote>
