<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Who hath given me before that I should repay him? All things that are under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are mine.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be separated.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The members of his flesh cleave one to another: he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith's anvil,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> When he shall raise him up, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify themselves. <span class="stiki"><strong>Angels...</strong> Elim, <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>: which signifies here, the mighty, the most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a>, shall fear this monstrous fish, and in their fear shall seek to be purified.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The beams of the sun shall be under him, and he shall strew gold under him like mire. <span class="stiki"><strong>Under him...</strong> He shall not value the beams of the sun; and gold to him shall be like mire.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointments</a> boil.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">deep</a> as growing old. <span class="stiki"><strong>The deep as growing old...</strong> Growing hoary, as it were with the froth which he leaves behind him.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He beholdeth every high thing, he is king over all the children of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>He is king, etc...</strong> He is superior in strength to all that are great and strong amongst living creatures: mystically it is understood of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who is king over all the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>.</span></span></blockquote>
