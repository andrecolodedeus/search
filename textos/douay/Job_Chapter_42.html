<div class="h1a">Job submits himself. God pronounces in his favour. Job offers sacrifice for his friends. He is blessed with riches and children, and dies happily,</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Job answered the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Hear, and I will speak: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore I reprehend myself, and do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> in dust and ashes.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite: My <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before me, as my servant Job hath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Take unto you therefore seven oxen and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and my servant Job shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you: his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you: for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had spoken to them, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> accepted the face of Job.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also was turned at the <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> of Job, when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for his friends. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house: and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had brought upon him. And every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gave him one ewe, and one earring of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he had seven sons, and three daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of one Dies, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the second Cassia, and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the third Cornustibii.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And there were not found in all the earth <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children's children, unto the fourth <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, and he died an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and full of days.</span></p>
