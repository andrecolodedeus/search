<h1>Job Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">Job maintains his innocence, and complains of his friends.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But Job answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> O that my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whereby I have deserved <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance. <span class="stiki"><strong>My sins, etc...</strong> He does not mean to compare his sufferings with his real <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but with the imaginary crimes which his friends imputed to him: and especially with his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, or grief, expressed in the third chapter, which they so much accused. Though, as he tells them here, it bore no proportion with the greatness of his calamity.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> As the sand of the sea, this would appear heavier: therefore, my words are full of sorrow:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For the arrows of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>? or can a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> taste that which, when tasted, bringeth death?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The things which before my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would not touch, now, through anguish, are my meats.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Who will grant that my request may come: and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may give me what I look for?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy one.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end, that I should keep patience?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Behold there is no help for me in myself, and my familiar friends also are departed from me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He that taketh away mercy from his friend, forsaketh the fear of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> My brethren have passed by me, as the torrent that passeth swiftly in the valleys.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> They that fear the hoary frost, the snow shall fall upon them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> At the time when they shall be scattered they shall perish: and after it groweth hot, they shall be melted out of their place.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The paths of their steps are entangled: they shall walk in vain, and shall perish.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a>, and wait a little while.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> They arc confounded, because I have hoped: they are come also even unto me, and are covered with shame.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now you are come: and now, seeing my affliction, you are afraid.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your substance?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Or deliver me from the hand of the enemy, and rescue me out of the hand of the mighty?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and if I have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of any thing, instruct me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Why have you detracted the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whereas there is none of you that can reprove me?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words to the wind.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to overthrow your friend.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> However, finish what you have begun: give ear and see whether I lie.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Answer, I beseech you, without contention: and speaking that which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, judge ye.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And you shall not find <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> in my tongue, neither shall folly sound in my mouth.</span></blockquote>
