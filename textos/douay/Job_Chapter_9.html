<div class="h1a">Job acknowledges God's justice: although he often afflicts the innocent.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Job answered, and said:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Indeed I know it is so, and that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot be justified, compared with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, knew it not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars, as it were, under a seal:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Who alone spreadeth out the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and walketh upon the waves of the sea,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Who maketh <a href="../cathen/02029a.htm#kimah-kesil">Arcturus, and Orion</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02029a.htm#ash">Hyades</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02029a.htm#hadre-theman">inner parts of the south</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Arcturus, etc...</strong> These are <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of stars or constellations. In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, Ash, Cesil, and Cimah. See note on <a href="../douay/job038.htm#verse31">Job 38:31</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is no number.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart, I shall not understand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who can say: Why dost thou so?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I, who although I should have any <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> thing, would not answer, but would make supplication to my judge.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And if he should hear me when I call, I should not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he had heard my voice.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without cause. <span class="stiki"><strong>Without cause...</strong> That is, without my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the cause: or without any crime of mine.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with bitterness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> If strength be demanded, he is most strong: if equity of judgment, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dare bear witness for me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I would show myself innocent, he shall prove me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Although I should be simple, even this my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, and I shall be weary of my life.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent and the wicked he consumeth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the pains of the innocent.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covereth the face of the judges thereof: and if it be not he, who is it then?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> My days have been swifter than a post: they have fled away and have not seen <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle flying to the prey.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> If I say: I will not speak so: I change my face, and am tormented with sorrow.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But if so also I am <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, why have I laboured in vain?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> If I be washed, as it were, with snow waters, and my hands shall shine ever clean:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Yet thou shalt plunge me in filth, and my garments shall abhor me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> For I shall not answer a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is like myself: nor one that may be heard with me equally in judgment.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> There is none that may be able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> I will speak, and will not fear him: for I cannot answer while I am in fear.</span></blockquote>
