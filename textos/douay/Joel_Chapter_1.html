<div class="h1a">The prophet describes the judgments that shall fall upon the people, and invites them to fasting and prayer.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, that came to Joel, the son of Phatuel.</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hear this, ye old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land: did this ever happen in your days, or in the days of your fathers?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Tell ye of this to your children, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> That which the palmerworm hath left, the locust hath eaten: and that which the locust hath left, the bruchus hath eaten: and that which the bruchus hath left, the mildew hath destroyed. <span class="stiki"><strong>That which the palmerworm hath left, etc...</strong> Some understand this literally of the desolation of the land by these insects: others understand it of the different invasions of the Chaldeans, or other enemies.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Awake, ye that are drunk, and weep, and mourn all ye that take delight; in drinking sweet wine: for it is cut off from your mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number: his teeth are like the teeth of a lion: and his cheek teeth as of a lion's whelp.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He hath laid my vineyard waste, and hath pulled off the bark of my fig tree: he hath stripped it bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Lament like a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> girded with <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a> for the husband of her youth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">Sacrifice</a> and libation is cut off from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a>: the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, have mourned:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The country is destroyed, the ground hath mourned: for the corn is wasted, the wine is confounded, the oil hath languished.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The husbandmen are ashamed, the vinedressers have howled for the wheat, and for the barley, because the harvest of the field is perished.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The vineyard is confounded, and the fig tree hath languished: the pomegranate tree, and the palm tree, and the apple tree, and all the trees of the field are withered: because <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is withdrawn from the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Gird yourselves, and lament, O ye <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, howl, ye <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>: go in, lie in <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, ye <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: because <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and libation is cut off from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of your God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Sanctify ye a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>, call an assembly, gather together the ancients, all the inhabitants of the land into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of your God</a>: and cry ye to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Ah, ah, ah, for the day: because the day of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is at hand, and it shall come like destruction from the mighty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Is not your food cut off before your eyes, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy and gladness</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of our God</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The beasts have rotted in their dung, the barns are destroyed, the storehouses are broken down: because the corn is confounded.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Why did the beasts groan, why did the herds of cattle low? because there is no pasture for them: yea, and the flocks of sheep are perished.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> To thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, will I cry: because fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: and the flame hath burnt all the trees of the country.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Yea, and the beasts of the field have looked up to thee, as a garden bed that thirsteth after rain, for the springs of waters are dried up, and fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span></blockquote>
