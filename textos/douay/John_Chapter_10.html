<div class="h1a">Christ is the door and the good shepherd. He and his Father are one.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way, the same is a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> and a robber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> To him the porter openeth: and the sheep hear his voice. And he calleth his own sheep by <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and leadeth them out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the voice of strangers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> This proverb <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said to them again: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> All others, as many as have come, are <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thieves</a> and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> I am the door. By me, if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in and go out, and shall find pastures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> cometh not, but for to steal and to kill and to destroy. I am come that they may have life and may have it more abundantly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> shepherd. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But the hireling and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flieth: and the wolf casteth and scattereth the sheep,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> shepherd: and I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> mine, and mine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> me, and I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>: and I lay down my life for my sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And other sheep I have that are not of this fold: them also I must bring. And they shall hear my voice: And there shall be one fold and one shepherd.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Therefore doth the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself. And I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> A dissension rose again among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for these words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And many of them said: He hath a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and is mad. Why hear you him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Can a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> open the eyes of the blind?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And it was the <a href="../cathen/04673b.htm">feast of the dedication</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and it was winter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> walked in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon's</a> porch.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore came round about him and said to him: How long dost thou hold our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in suspense? If thou be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, tell us plainly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them: I speak to you, and you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not: the works that I do in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, they give testimony of me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because you are not of my sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> My sheep hear my voice. And I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> them: and they follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And I give them life everlasting: and they shall not perish for ever. And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall pluck them out of my hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> That which my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath given me is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> I and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> are one. <span class="stiki"><strong>I and the Father are one...</strong> That is, one divine nature, but two distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> then took up stones to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them: Many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works I have showed you from my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. For which of those works do you <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered him: For a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> work we <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> thee not, but for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>: and because that thou being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, makest thyself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said, you are gods?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> If he called them gods to whom the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a> was spoken; and the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> cannot be broken:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Do you say of him whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> and sent into the world: Thou <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemest</a>; because I said: I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> If I do not the works of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But if I do, though you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works: that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> is in me and I in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> They sought therefore to take him: and he escaped out of their hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And he went again beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, into that place where <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was baptizing first. And there he abode.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And many resorted to him: and they said: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> indeed did no sign.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> But all things whatsoever <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> said of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him.</span></p>
