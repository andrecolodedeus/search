<h1>John Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ raises Lazarus to life. The rulers resolve to put him to death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now there was a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sick, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, of <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a>, of the town of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> and of <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> her sister.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> (And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> was she that <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->anointed<!--</a>--> the Lord with <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> and wiped his feet with her <a href="../cathen/07113a.htm">hair</a>: whose brother <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> was sick.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> is sick.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> and her sister <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> and <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then after that, he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Let us go into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> say to him: Rabbi, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> but now sought to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> thee. And goest thou thither again?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> walk in the day he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> These things he said; and after that he said to them: <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> our friend sleepeth: but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke of his death: and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them plainly: <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> is dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I am glad, for your sakes; that I was not there, that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But, let us go to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a> therefore, who is called <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Didymus<!--</a>-->, said to his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Let us also go, that we may die with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore came: and found that he had been four days already in the grave.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> (Now <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a> was near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, about fifteen furlongs off.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were come to <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>-->, to comfort them concerning their brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> therefore, as soon as she heard that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was come, went to meet him: but <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> sat at home.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> therefore said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But now also I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that whatsoever thou wilt ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will give it thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> saith to him: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he shall rise again, in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection at the last day</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in me, although he be dead, shall live:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And every one that liveth and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in me shall not die for ever. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Believest<!--</a>--> thou this?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that thou art <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the living God</a>, who art come into this world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when she had said these things, she went and called her sister <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> secretly, saying: The master is come and calleth for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> She, as soon as she heard this, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->riseth<!--</a>--> quickly and cometh to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> had met him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore, who were with her in the house and comforted her, when they saw <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>-->, that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> When <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> therefore was come where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet and saith to him. Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were come with her weeping, groaned in the spirit and troubled himself,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said: Behold how he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> born blind have caused that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should not die?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith: Take away the stone. <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a>, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: Did not I say to thee that if thou <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, thou shalt see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> They took therefore the stone away. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> lifting up his eyes, said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> that thou hearest me always: but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that thou hast sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, come forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands. And his face was bound about with a napkin. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: Loose him and let him go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Many therefore of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who were come to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> and <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> and had seen the things that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> But some of them went to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and told them the things that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had done.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> The chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, therefore, and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> gathered a council and said: What do we, for this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> doth many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> If we let him alone so, all will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him; and the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Romans<!--</a>--> will come, and take away our place and nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> But one of them, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, being the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> that year, said to them: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And this he spoke not of himself: but being the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of that year, he <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should die for the nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of God</a> that were <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">dispersed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> walked no more openly among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: but he went into a country near the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, unto a city that is called <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Ephrem<!--</a>-->. And there he abode with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was at hand: and many from the country went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->purify<!--</a>--> themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> They sought therefore for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> had given a commandment that, if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.</span></p>
