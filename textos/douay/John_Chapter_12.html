<div class="h1a">The anointing of Christ's feet. His riding into Jerusalem upon an ass. A voice from heaven.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore, six days before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a>, where <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> had been dead, whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->raised<!--</a>--> to life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they made him a supper there: and <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> served. But <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> was one of them that were at table with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> therefore took a pound of <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> of right spikenard, of great price, and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->anointed<!--</a>--> the feet of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and wiped his feet with her <a href="../cathen/07113a.htm">hair</a>. And the house was filled with the odour of the <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, he that was about to betray him, said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Why was not this <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now he said this not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> and, having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->burial<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always. <span class="stiki"><strong>Me you have not always...</strong> Viz., in a visible manner, as when conversant here on earth; and as we have the poor, whom we may daily assist and relieve.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> A great multitude therefore of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he was there; and they came, not for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> sake only, but that they might see <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, whom he had <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->raised<!--</a>--> from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> thought to kill <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> also:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Because many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of him, went away and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And on the next day, a great multitude that was come to the festival day, when they had heard that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was coming to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a>. <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is he that cometh in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of the Lord</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> found a young ass and sat upon it, as it is written:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold thy king cometh, sitting on an ass' colt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> These things his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at the first: but when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, then they remembered that these things were written of him and that they had done these things to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> out of the grave and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->raised<!--</a>--> him from the dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? Behold, the whole world is gone after him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now there were certain <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> among them, who came up to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> on the festival day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> These therefore came to <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>, who was of <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida of Galilee</a>, and desired him, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Sir<!--</a>-->, we would see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> cometh and telleth <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a>. Again <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> and <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> told <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them, saying: The hour is come that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Itself remaineth alone. But if it die it bringeth forth much fruit. He that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> his life shall lose it and he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateth</a> his life in this world keepeth it unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> minister to me, let him follow me: and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> minister to me, him will my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Now is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> troubled. And what shall I say? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>. A voice therefore came from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: I have both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> it and will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> it again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> The multitude therefore that stood and heard said that it thundered. Others said: An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> spoke to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Now is the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of the world: now shall the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a> be cast out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> (Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> that <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> abideth for ever. And how sayest thou: The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must be lifted up? Who is this <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, and the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not whither be goeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Whilst you have the light, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke: and he went away and hid himself from them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And whereas he had done so many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> before them, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> That the saying of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a> might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our hearing? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Therefore they could not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a> said again: <span class="stiki"><strong>They could not believe...</strong> Because they would not, saith <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Tract. 33, in Joan.

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart and be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>: and I should heal them.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> These things said <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, when he saw his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and spoke of him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> However, many of the chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him: but because of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> For they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> more than the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cried and said: He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in me doth not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me, but in him that sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> I am come, a light into the world, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in me may not remain in darkness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hear my words and keep them not, I do not <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> him for I came not to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> the world, but to save the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> me and receiveth not my words hath one that <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgeth<!--</a>--> him.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> For I have not spoken of myself: but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say and what I should speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> said unto me, so do I speak.</span></p>
