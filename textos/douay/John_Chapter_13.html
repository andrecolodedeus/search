Some <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->chronologers<!--</a>--> are of opinion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> suffered in the thirty-seventh year of his age: but these different opinions on this subject are of no consequence.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">supper</a> was done (the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> having now put into the heart of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon</a>, to betray him),</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->riseth<!--</a>--> from <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">supper</a> and layeth aside his garments and, having taken a towel, girded himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> After that, he putteth water into a basin and began to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash the feet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He cometh therefore to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> saith to him: Lord, dost thou <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash my feet</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said to him: What I do, thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> not now; but thou shalt <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> hereafter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> saith to him: Thou shalt never <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash my feet</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered him: If I <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash</a> thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: He that is <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed</a> needeth not but to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash his feet</a>, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For he <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then after he had <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed their feet</a> and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you what I have done to you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> You call me Master and Lord. And you say well: for so I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> If then I being your Lord and Master, have <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed your feet</a>; you also ought to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash</a> one another's feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord: neither is the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> greater than he that sent him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, you shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> if you do them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> I speak not of you all: I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> whom I have chosen. But that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me shall lift up his heel against me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I am he.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me: and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you, one of you shall betray me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> therefore looked one upon another, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubting</a> of whom he spoke.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now there was leaning on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> bosom <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">one of his disciples</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> therefore beckoned to him and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He therefore, leaning on the breast of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, saith to him: Lord, who is it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And after the morsel, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">entered into him</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly. <span class="stiki"><strong>That which thou dost, do quickly...</strong> It is not a license, much less a command, to go about his treason: but a signification to him that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would not hinder or resist what he was about, do it as soon as he pleased: but was both ready and desirous to suffer for our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Now no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at the table <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to what purpose he said this unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For some thought, because <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> had the purse, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">festival day</a>: or that he should give something to the poor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> He therefore, having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> When he therefore was gone out, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: Now is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in him, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> him in himself: and immediately will he <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me. And as I said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> A new commandment I give unto you: That you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, as I have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> you, that you also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one for another.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now: but thou shalt follow hereafter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.</span>
