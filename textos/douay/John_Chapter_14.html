<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you.

Any difficulty of understanding the meaning of these words will vanish, when the relative circumstances of the text here are considered: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being at this time shortly to suffer death, signified to his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> nature by these very words: for as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he could not die. And therefore as he was both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it must follow that according to his humanity he was to die, which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were soon to see and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as he expresses, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->ver<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->29<!--</a>-->. And now I have told you before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And now I have told you before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> I will not now speak many things with you. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a> cometh: and in me he hath not any thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But that the world may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>: and as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath given me commandments, so do I.
