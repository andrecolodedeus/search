<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now you are clean, by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of the word which I have spoken to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Abide in me: and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I am the vine: you the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch and shall wither: and they shall gather him up and cast him into the fire: and he burneth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will: and it shall be done unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> In this is my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>: that you bring forth very much fruit and become my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> me, I also have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> you. Abide in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: as I also have kept <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">my Father's commandments</a> and do abide in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> These things I have spoken to you, that my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> may be in you, and your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> may be filled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> This is my commandment, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, as I have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than this no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath, that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lay down his life for his friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I will not now call you servants: for the servant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends because all things, whatsoever I have heard of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, I have made known to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> You have not chosen me: but I have chosen you; and have appointed you, that you should go and should bring forth fruit; and your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, he may give it you.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> If you had been of the world, the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateth</a> you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not greater than his master. If they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me, they will also persecute you. If they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But all these things they will do to you for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake: because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not him that sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but now they have no excuse for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateth</a> me <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateth</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> If I had not done among them the works that no other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath done, they would not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but now they have both seen and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> both me and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law: they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me without cause.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But when the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> cometh, whom I will send you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of truth</a>, who proceedeth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he shall give testimony of me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Whom I will send...</strong> This proves, against the modern <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greeks</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceedeth from the Son, as well as from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>: otherwise he could not be sent by the Son.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning.</span></p>
