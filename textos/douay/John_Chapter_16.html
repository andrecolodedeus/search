<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> These things have I spoken to you things have I spoken to you that you may not be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> They will put you out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doth a service to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And these things will they do to you; because they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> nor me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: it is expedient to you that I go. For if I go not, the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> will not come to you: but if I go, I will send him to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when he is come, he will convince the world of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->. <span class="stiki"><strong>He will convince the world of sin, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by his coming brought over many thousands, first, to a sense of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Secondly, to a conviction of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, now sitting at the right hand of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. And thirdly, to a right apprehension of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> prepared for them that choose to follow <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, who is already judged and condemned.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But when he, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of truth</a>, is come, he will teach you all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For he shall not speak of himself: but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak. And the things that are to come, he shall show you. <span class="stiki"><strong>Will teach you all truth...</strong> See the annotation on chap. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->14<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->ver<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->26<!--</a>-->.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He shall <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> me: because he shall receive of mine and shall show it to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> All things whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath are mine. Therefore I said that he shall receive of me and show it to you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> A little while, and now you shall not see me: and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then some of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me: and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, Because I go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what he speaketh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> that they had a mind to ask him. And he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is born into the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So also you now indeed have sorrow: but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice. And your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall take from you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you: if you ask the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> any thing in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, he will give it you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Hitherto, you have not asked any thing in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>. Ask, and you shall receive; that your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> may be full.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but will show you plainly of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> In that day, you shall ask in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: and I say not to you that I will ask the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> himself <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> you, because you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> me and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that I came out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> I came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> and am come into the world: again I leave the world and I go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly and speakest no proverb.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowest</a> all things and thou needest not that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should ask thee. By this we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that thou camest forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them: Do you now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his own and shall leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> is with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress. But have confidence. I have overcome the world.</span></p>
