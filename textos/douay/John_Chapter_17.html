<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> These things <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke: and lifting up his eyes to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he said: the hour is come. Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to all whom thou hast given him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Now this is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life: That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thee, the <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">only true God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom thou hast sent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And now <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> thou me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with thyself, with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had, before the world was, with thee.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I have manifested thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were: and to me thou gavest them. And they have kept thy word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that all things which thou hast given me are from thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them. And they have received them and have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in very deed that I came out from thee: and they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that thou didst send me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And all my things are thine, and thine are mine: and I am <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Holy Father</a>, keep them in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> whom thou hast given me: that they may be one, as we also are.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> While I was with them, I kept them in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept: and none of them is lost, but the son of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->perdition<!--</a>-->: that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> may be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And now I come to thee: and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> filled in themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I have given them thy word, and the world hath <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them: because they are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Sanctify them in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thy word is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And not for them only do I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but for them also who through their word shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> That they all may be one, as thou, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us: that the world may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that thou hast sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which thou hast given me, I have given to them: that, they may be one, as we also are one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> I in them, and thou in me: that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou hast sent me and hast <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> them, as thou hast also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me: that they may see my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which thou hast given me, because thou hast <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> me before the creation of the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Just Father</a>, the world hath not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thee: but I have <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> thee.
