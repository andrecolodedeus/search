<div class="h1a">The history of the passion of Christ.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had said these things, he went forth with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> over the <a href="../cathen/03475c.htm">brook Cedron</a>, where there was a garden, into which he entered with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> also, who betrayed him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the place: because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had often resorted thither together with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore, <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> all things that should come upon him, went forth and said to them: Whom seek ye?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> They answered him: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: I am he. And <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> also, who betrayed him, stood with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> As soon therefore as he had said to them: I am he; they went backward and fell to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek ye? And they said: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: I have told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> That the word might be fulfilled which he said: Of them whom thou hast given me, I have not lost any one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and cut off his right ear. And the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of thee servant was Malchus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: Put up thy sword into the scabbard. The chalice which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then the band and the tribune and the servants of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> took <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and bound him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they led him away to <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> first, for he was father-in-law to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, who was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of that year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> was he who had given the counsel to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: That it was expedient that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should die for the people.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: and so did another <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. And that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and went in with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> stood at the door without. The other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> therefore, who was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, went out and spoke to the portress and brought in <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The maid therefore that was portress saith to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: Art not thou also one of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>? He saith I am not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Now the servants and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> also, standing and warming himself.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> therefore asked <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and of his doctrine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered him: I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, whither all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> resort: and in secret I have spoken nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Why askest thou me? Ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them. Behold they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what things I have said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by gave <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> a blow, saying: Answerest thou the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> so?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered him: If I have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, give testimony of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if well, why strikest thou me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> sent him bound to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him: Art not thou also one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? He denied it and said: I am not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> One of the servants of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> (a kinsman to <a href="../cathen/09566b.htm">him whose ear Peter cut off</a>) saith to him: Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Again therefore <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> denied: and immediately the cock crew.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Then they led <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> to the governor's hall. And it was morning: and they went not into the <a href="../cathen/12404a.htm">hall</a>, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation bring you against this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> They answered and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore said to them: Take him you, and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> him according to your law. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> That the word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> might be fulfilled, which he said, signifying what death he should die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore went into the <a href="../cathen/12404a.htm">hall</a> again and called <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and said to him: Art thou the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered: Am I a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>? Thy own nation and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have delivered thee up to me. What hast thou done?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: but now my kingdom is not from hence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Every one that is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> heareth my voice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saith to him: What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? And when he said this, he went out again to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and saith to them: I find no cause in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>. Will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Then cried they all again, saying: Not this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</span></p>
