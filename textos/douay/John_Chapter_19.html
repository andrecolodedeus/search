<div class="h1a">The continuation of the history of the Passion of Christ.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then therefore <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> took <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and scourged him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the soldiers platting a <a href="../cathen/04540b.htm">crown of thorns</a>, put it upon his head: and they put on him a purple garment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they came to him and said: Hail, king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And they gave him blows.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore went forth again and saith to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I find no cause in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> (<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore came forth, bearing the <a href="../cathen/04540b.htm">crown of thorns</a> and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the Man.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> When the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, therefore, and the servants had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, Crucify him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered him: We have a <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>; and according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> he ought to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">die</a>, because he made himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> When <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore had heard this saying, he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feared</a> the more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he entered into the <a href="../cathen/12404a.htm">hall</a> again; and he said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: Whence art thou? But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> gave him no answer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Knowest</a> thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee hath the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And from henceforth <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> sought to release him. But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cried out, saying: If thou release this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, thou art not <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a> friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had heard these words, he brought <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> forth and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called <a href="../cathen/06328b.htm">Lithostrotos</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/06328b.htm">Gabbatha</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And it was the <a href="../cathen/11476a.htm">parasceve</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, about the <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth hour</a>: and he saith to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Behold your king. <span class="stiki"><strong>The parasceve of the pasch...</strong> That is, the day before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">paschal</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>. The eve of every <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> was called the <a href="../cathen/11476a.htm">parasceve</a>, or day of preparation. But this was the eve of a high <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, viz., that which fell in the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">paschal</a> week.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But they cried out: Away with him: Away with him: Crucify him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saith to them: shall I crucify your king? The chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> answered: We have no king but <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and led him forth.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And bearing his own <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, he went forth to the place which is called <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Calvary</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Golgotha</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the midst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> wrote a title also: and he put it upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> This title therefore many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did read: because the place where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was crucified was nigh to the city. And it was written in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, in Greek, and in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Write not: The King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But that he said: I am the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered: What I have written, I have written.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took his garments, (and they made four parts, to every soldier a part) and also his <a href="../cathen/07400b.htm">coat</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/07400b.htm">coat</a> was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> They said then one to another: Let us not cut it but let us <a href="../cathen/06375b.htm">cast lots</a> for it, whose it shall be; that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> might be fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they have <a href="../cathen/06375b.htm">cast lots</a>. And the soldiers indeed did these things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Now there stood by the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother</a> and his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother's</a> sister, <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary of Cleophas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore had seen his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> standing whom he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>, he saith to his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother</a>: <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a>, behold thy son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> After that, he saith to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> took her to his own.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Afterwards, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> that all things were now accomplished, that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Now there was a vessel set there, full of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar about <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a>, put it to his mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (because it was the <a href="../cathen/11476a.htm">parasceve</a>), that the bodies might not remain upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a> (for that was a great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>), besought <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> that their legs might be broken: and that they might be taken away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> The soldiers therefore came: and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But after they were come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But one of the soldiers with a <a href="../cathen/08773a.htm">spear</a> opened his side: and immediately there came out blood and water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he that saw it hath given testimony: and his testimony is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> that he saith <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: that you also may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For these things were done that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> might be fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And again another <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> saith: They shall look on him whom they pierced.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And after these things, <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a> (because he was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but secretly for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>), besought <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> that he might take away the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> gave leave. He came therefore and took away the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> also came (he who at the first came to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> by night), bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> They took therefore the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and bound it in <a href="../cathen/13762a.htm">linen cloths</a>, with the spices, as the manner of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is to bury.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Now there was in the place where he was crucified a garden: and in the garden a new <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>, wherein no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> yet had been laid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> There, therefore, because of the <a href="../cathen/11476a.htm">parasceve</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, they laid <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: because the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a> was nigh at hand.</span></p>
