<div class="h1a">Christ changes water into wine. He casts the sellers out of the temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the third day, there was a <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana of Galilee</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother of Jesus</a> was there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also was invited, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">-->wine<!--</a>--> failing, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother of Jesus</a> saith to him: They have no <!--<a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">-->wine<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a>, what is that to me and to thee? My hour is not yet come. <span class="stiki"><strong>What is that to me, etc...</strong> These words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, spoken to his <!--<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">-->mother<!--</a>-->, have been understood by some <!--<a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">-->commentators<!--</a>--> as harsh, they not considering the next following <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->verse<!--</a>-->: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye, which plainly shows that his mother <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> that he was to perform, and that it was at her request he wrought it; besides the manner of speaking the words as to the tone, and the countenance shown at the same time, which could only be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those who were present, or from what had followed: for words indicating <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in one tone of voice, would be understood quite the reverse in another.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->purifying<!--</a>--> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, containing two or three measures apiece.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: Draw out now and carry to the chief steward of the feast. And they carried it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when the chief steward had tasted the water made <!--<a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">-->wine<!--</a>--> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not whence it was, but the waiters <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> who had drawn the water: the chief steward calleth the bridegroom,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And saith to him: Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at first setteth forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">-->wine<!--</a>-->, and when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have well <!--<a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">-->drunk<!--</a>-->, then that which is worse. But thou hast kept the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">-->wine<!--</a>--> until now.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> This beginning of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana of Galilee</a> and manifested his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> After this, he went down to <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, he and his mother and his brethren and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: and they remained there not many days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was at hand: and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he found in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> them that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when he had made, as it were, a scourge of little cords, he drove them all out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, the sheep also and the oxen: and the money of the changers he poured out, and the tables he overthrew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And to them that sold doves he said: Take these things hence, and make not the house of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> a house of traffic.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> remembered, that it was written: The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of thy house hath eaten me up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, therefore, answered, and said to him: What sign dost thou show unto us, seeing thou dost these things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said to them: Destroy this <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>; and in three days I will raise it up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> then said: Six and forty years was this <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But he spoke of the temple of his body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> When therefore he was <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again from the dead</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> remembered that he had said this: and they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> and the word that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now when he was at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, upon the festival day, many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, seeing his <!--<a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">-->signs<!--</a>--> which he did.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did not trust himself unto them: for that he <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And because he needed not that any should give testimony of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for he <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> what was in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span></p>
