<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">first day of the week</a>, <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>: and she saw the stone taken away from the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> She ran therefore and cometh to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">other disciple whom Jesus loved</a> and saith to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>: and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where they have laid him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> therefore went out, and the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">other disciple</a>: and they came to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they both ran together: and that <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">other disciple</a> did outrun <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and came first to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying: but yet he went not in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then cometh <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>, following him, and went into the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>: and saw the linen cloths lying,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then that other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> also went in, who came first to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>: and he saw and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For as yet they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>, that he must <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again from the dead</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> therefore departed again to their home.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> stood at the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a> without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down and looked into the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And she saw two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had been laid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> They say to her: <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a>, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord: and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where they have laid him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> When she had thus said, she turned herself back and saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> standing: and she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that it was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a>, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She, thinking that it was the gardener, saith to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Sir<!--</a>-->, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him: and I will take him away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>-->. She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->).</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: Do not touch me: for I am not yet <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended</a> to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. But go to my brethren and say to them: I ascend to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> and to your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> cometh and telleth the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: I have seen the Lord; and these things he said to me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now when it was late the same day, the first of the week, and the doors were shut, where the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were gathered together, for fear of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came and stood in the midst and said to them: Peace be to you. <span class="stiki"><strong>The doors were shut...</strong> The same power which could bring <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> whole body, entire in all its dimensions, through the doors, can without the least question make the same body <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">sacrament</a>; though both the one and the other be above our comprehension.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> therefore were glad, when they saw the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath sent me, I also send you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them: and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall retain, they are retained. <span class="stiki"><strong>Whose sins, etc...</strong> See here the commission, stamped by the broad seal of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, by virtue of which the pastors of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's church</a> absolve repenting sinners upon their confession.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, one of the twelve, who is called <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Didymus<!--</a>-->, was not with them when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the place of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And after eight days, again his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were within, and <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a> with them. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said: Peace be to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Then he said to <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>: Put in thy finger hither and see my hands. And bring hither the hand and put it into my side. And be not faithless, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a> answered and said to him: My Lord and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, thou hast <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> are they that have not seen and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Many other signs also did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the sight of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, which are not written in this book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But these are written, that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: and that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, you may have life in his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span></p>
