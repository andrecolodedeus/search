<h1>John Chapter 21</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ manifests himself to his disciples by the sea side and gives Peter the charge of his sheep.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After this, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> showed himself to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">sea of Tiberias</a>. And he showed himself after this manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> There were together: <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas, who is called Didymus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathanael</a>, who was of <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana of Galilee</a>, and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> saith to them: I go a fishing. They say to him: We also come with thee. And they went forth and entered into the ship: and that night they caught nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But when the morning was come, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> stood on the shore: yet the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that it was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said to them: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Children<!--</a>-->, have you any meat? They answered him: No.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He saith to them: Cast the net on the right side of the ship; and you shall find. They cast therefore: and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> That <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">disciple therefore whom Jesus loved</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: It is the Lord. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat about him (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came in the ship (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fishes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> As soon then as they came to land they saw hot coals lying, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: Bring hither of the fishes which you have now caught.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> went up and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three. And although there were so many, the net was not broken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: Come and dine. And none of them who were at meat, durst ask him: Who art thou? <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that it was the Lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cometh and taketh bread and giveth them: and fish in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> This is now the third time that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was manifested to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, after he was risen from the dead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> When therefore they had dined, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>: <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon, son of John</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> thou me more than these? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowest</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He saith to him again: <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon, son of John</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> thou me? He saith to him: yea, Lord, thou <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowest</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He said to him the third time: <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon, son of John</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> thou me? <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was grieved because he had said to him the third time: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Lovest</a> thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowest</a> all things: thou <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowest</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thee. He said to him: Feed my sheep. <span class="stiki"><strong>Feed my sheep...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> had <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> the spiritual supremacy to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>; <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->St<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Matt<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->16<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->19<!--</a>-->; and here he fulfils that <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, by charging him with the superintendency of all his sheep, without exception; and consequently of his whole flock, that is, of his own church.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to thee, When thou wast younger, thou didst gird thyself and didst walk where thou wouldst. But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and lead thee whither thou wouldst not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And this he said, signifying by what death he should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when he had said this, he saith to him: Follow me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> turning about, saw that <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">disciple whom Jesus loved</a> following, who also leaned on his breast at <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">supper</a> and said: Lord, who is he that shall betray thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Him therefore when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> had seen, he saith to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: Lord, and what shall this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> do?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee? Follow thou me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> should not die. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did not say to him: He should not die; but: So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> This is that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who giveth testimony of these things and hath written these things: and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his testimony is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But there are also many other things which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did which, if they were written every one, the world itself. I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written.</span></p>
