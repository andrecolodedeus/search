<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore understood the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> had heard that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> maketh more <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizeth</a> more than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He left <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and went again into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he was of necessity to pass through <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He cometh therefore to a city of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, which is called Sichar, near the land which <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> gave to his son <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> was there. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>. It was about the <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth hour</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> There cometh a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, to draw water. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: Give me to drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were gone into the city to buy meats.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then that <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saith to him: How dost thou, being a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>; ask of me to drink, who am a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do not communicate with the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said to her: If thou didst <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and who he is that saith to thee: Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saith to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Sir<!--</a>-->, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> is deep. From whence then hast thou living water?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Art thou greater than our father <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, who gave us the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> and drank thereof, himself and his children and his cattle?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him shall not thirst for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But the water that I will give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Sir<!--</a>-->, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> answered and said: I have no husband. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to her: Thou hast said well: I have no husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. This, thou hast said <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saith to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Sir<!--</a>-->, I perceive that thou art a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Our fathers <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> on this mountain: and you say that at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is the place where <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>This mountain...</strong> Garizim, where the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> had their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, nor in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>

For <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But the hour cometh and now is, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adorers</a> shall <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit: and they that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> him must <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saith to him: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> cometh (who is called <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>): therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And immediately his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came. And they wondered that he talked with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Yet no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said: What seekest thou? Or: Why talkest thou with her?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> therefore left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> there:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Come, and see a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> They went therefore out of the city and came unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> In the mean time, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> him, saying: Rabbi, eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But he said to them: I have meat to eat which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> therefore said one to another: Hath any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> brought him to eat?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: My meat is to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Do not you say: There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries. For they are white already to harvest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> For in this is the saying <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: That it is one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour. Others have laboured: and you have entered into their labours.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Now of that city many of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him, for the word of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> So when the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And many more <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him, because of his own word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And they said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: We now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Now after two days, he departed thence and went into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> himself gave testimony that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> hath no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in his own country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And when he was come into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galileans</a> received him, having seen all the things he had done at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> on the festival day: for they also went to the festival day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> He came again therefore into <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana of Galilee</a>, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> He having heard that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was come from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, sent to him and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> him to come down and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said to him: Unless you see <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a>, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: Go thy way. Thy son liveth. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the word which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him and went his way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And as he was going down, his servants met him: and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> The father therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was at the same hour that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Thy son liveth. And himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and his whole house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> This is again the second <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did, when he was come out of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span></p>
