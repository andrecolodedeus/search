<h1>John Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ heals on the sabbath the man languishing thirty-eight years. His discourse upon this occasion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things was a festival day of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now there is at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a pond, called Probatica, which in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> is <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a>, having five porches. <span class="stiki"><strong>Probatica...</strong> That is, the sheep pond; either so called, because the sheep were washed therein, that were to be offered up in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, or because it was near the sheep gate. That this was a pond where <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought is evident from the sacred text; and also that the water had no natural virtue to heal, as one only of those put in after the motion of the water was restored to health; for if the water had the healing quality, the others would have the like benefit, being put into it about the same time.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered: waiting for the moving of the water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> descended at certain times into the pond and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And there was a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Him when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had seen lying, and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The infirm <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> answered him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Sir<!--</a>-->, I have no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed and walk.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And immediately the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was made whole: and he took up his bed and walked. And it was the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> that day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said to him that was healed: It is the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>. It is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me: Take up thy bed and walk.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They asked him therefore: Who is that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who said to thee: Take up thy bed and walk?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But he who was healed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not who it was: for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went aside from the multitude standing in the place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Afterwards, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> findeth him in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went his way and told the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that it was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who had made him whole.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Therefore did the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> persecute <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, because he did these things on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them: My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> worketh until now; and I work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Hereupon therefore the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> but also said <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, making himself equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> the Son and showeth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he show him, that you may wonder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->raiseth<!--</a>--> up the dead and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For neither does the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but hath given all <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> to the Son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> That all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son, as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. He who honoureth not the Son honoureth not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who hath sent him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say unto you that he who heareth my word and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> him that sent me hath life everlasting: and cometh not into <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->, but is passed from death to life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: and they that hear shall live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath life in himself, so he hath given to the Son also to have life in himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he hath given him power to do <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->, because he is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Wonder not at this: for the hour cometh wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they that have done <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things shall come forth unto the resurrection of life: but they that have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unto the resurrection of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->. <span class="stiki"><strong>Unto the resurrection of judgment...</strong> That is, condemnation.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>-->. And my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: because I seek not my own will but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that sent me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> There is another that beareth witness of me: and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the witness which he witnesseth of me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> You sent to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>: and he gave testimony to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But I receive not testimony from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but I say these things, that you may be saved.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But I have a greater testimony than that of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>: for the works which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath given me to perfect, the works themselves which I do, give testimony of me, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> himself who hath sent me hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Search the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>: for you think in them to have life everlasting. And the same are they that give testimony of me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Search the scriptures...</strong> Or, <em>You search the scriptures</em>. <em>Scrutamini, ereunat.</em> It is not a command for all to read the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>; but a reproach to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, that reading the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> as they did, and thinking to find everlasting life in them, they would not receive him to whom all those <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> gave testimony, and through whom alone they could have that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And you will not come to me that you may have life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> I receive not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, that you have not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> I am come in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, him you will receive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> How can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> one from another: and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, you do not seek?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Think not that I will accuse you to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. There is one that accuseth you, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in whom you trust.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> For if you did <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would perhaps <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me also: for he wrote of me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> But if you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> his writings, how will you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> my words?</span></p>
