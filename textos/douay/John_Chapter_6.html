<div class="h1a">Christ feeds five thousand with five loaves. He walks upon the sea and discourses of the bread of life.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went over the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">sea of Galilee</a>, which is that of <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Tiberias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he did on them that were diseased.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore went up into a mountain: and there he sat with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, the festival day of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, was near at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore had lifted up his eyes and seen that a very great multitude cometh to him, he said to <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a>: Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And this he said to try him: for he himself <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> what he would do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> answered him: Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one may take a little.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> One of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a>, the brother of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>, saith to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves and two fishes. But what are these among so many?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: Make the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> sit down. Now, there was much grass in the place. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> took the loaves: and when he had given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down. In like manner also of the fishes, as much as they would.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when they were filled, he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> They gathered up therefore and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above to them that had eaten.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, when they had seen what a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had done, said: This is of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that is to come into the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore, when he <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> that they would come to take him by force and make him king, fled again into the mountains, himself alone.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when evening was come, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> went down to the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when they had gone up into a ship, they went over the sea to <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>. And it was now dark: and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not come unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the sea arose, by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of a great wind that blew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> walking upon the sea and drawing nigh to the ship. And they were afraid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But he saith to them: It is I. Be not afraid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> They were willing therefore to take him into the ship. And presently the ship was at the land to which they were going.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other ship there but one: and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had not entered into the ship with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but that his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were gone away alone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But other ships came in from Tiberias, nigh unto the place where they had eaten the bread, the Lord giving thanks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> When therefore the multitude saw that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not there, nor his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, they took shipping and came to <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, seeking for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when they had found him on that other side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them and said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you, you seek me, not because you have seen <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto life everlasting, which the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> will give you. For him hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God, the Father</a>, sealed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> They said therefore unto him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said to them: This is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him whom he hath sent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> They said therefore to him: What sign therefore dost thou show that we may see and may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> thee? What dost thou work?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Our fathers did eat <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, as it is written: He gave them bread from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you; <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> gave you not bread from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> giveth you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> For the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">bread of God</a> is that which cometh down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and giveth life to the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> They said therefore unto him: Lord, give us always this bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: I am the bread of life. He that cometh to me shall not hunger: and he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in me shall never thirst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But I said unto you that you also have seen me, and you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> All that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> giveth to me shall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will not cast out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Because I came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, not to do my own will but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Now this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who sent me: that of all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing; but should raise it up again in the last day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> that sent me: that every one who seeth the Son and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in him may have life everlasting. And I will raise him up in the last day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore murmured at him, because he had said: I am the living bread which came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And they said: Is not this <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, whose father and mother we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? How then saith he: I came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore answered and said to them: Murmur not among yourselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can come to me, except the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who hath sent me, draw him.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> It is written in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: And they shall all be taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Not that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>: but he who is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he hath seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say unto you: He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in me hath everlasting life.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> I am the bread of life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Your fathers did eat <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: and are dead.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> I am the living bread which came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore strove among themselves, saying: How can this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> give us his flesh to eat?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say unto you: except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you. <span class="stiki"><strong>Except you eat and drink, etc...</strong> To receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">body and blood of Christ</a>, is a divine <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precept</a>, insinuated in this text; which the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> fulfil, though they receive but in <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">one kind</a>; because in <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">one kind</a> they receive both body and blood, which cannot be separated from each other. Hence, life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is here <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to the worthy receiving, though but in <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">one kind</a>. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Ver<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->52<!--</a>-->.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life: and I will raise him up in the last day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> For my flesh is meat indeed: and my blood is drink indeed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me: and I in him.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> This is the bread that came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Not as your fathers did eat <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> and are dead. He that eateth this bread shall live for ever.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> These things he said, teaching in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> Many therefore of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, hearing it, said: This saying is hard; and who can hear it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing in himself</a> that his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> murmured at this, said to them: Doth this <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> If then you shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> ascend up where he was before? <span class="stiki"><strong>If then you shall see, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by mentioning his ascension, by this instance of his power and divinity, would confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what he had before asserted; and at the same time correct their gross apprehension of eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, in a vulgar and carnal manner, by letting them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> he should take his whole body living with him to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and consequently not suffer it to be as they supposed, divided, mangled, and consumed upon earth.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> It is the spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. <span class="stiki"><strong>The flesh profiteth nothing...</strong> Dead flesh separated from the spirit, in the gross manner they supposed they were to eat his flesh, would profit nothing. Neither doth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> flesh, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> natural and carnal apprehension, (which refuses to be subject to the spirit, and words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>), profit any thing. But it would be the height of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, to say the living flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (which we receive in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">blessed sacrament</a>, with his spirit, that is, with his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and divinity) profiteth nothing. For if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh had profited us nothing, he would never have taken flesh for us, nor died in us nothing, he would never have taken flesh for us, nor died in the flesh for us. <strong>Are spirit and life...</strong> By proposing to you a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> sacrament, in which you shall receive, in a wonderful manner, spirit, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and life, in its very fountain.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> But there are some of you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> from the beginning who they were that did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and who he was that would betray him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And he said: Therefore did I say to you that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can come to me, unless it be given him by my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> After this, many of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> went back and walked no more with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to the twelve: Will you also go away?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse70">70</span> And we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that thou art the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse71">71</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them: Have not I chosen you twelve? And one of you is a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse72">72</span> Now he meant <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon</a>: for this same was about to betray him, whereas he was one of the twelve.</span></p>
