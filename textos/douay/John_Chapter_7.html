<h1>John Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ goes up to the feast of the tabernacles. He teaches in the temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> walked in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>: for he would not walk in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> sought to kill him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">feast of tabernacles</a> was at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And his brethren said to, him: Pass from hence and go into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, that thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also may see thy works which thou dost.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For neither did his brethren <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The world cannot <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you: but me it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateth</a>, because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Go you up to this festival day: but I go not up to this festival day, because my time is not accomplished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> When he had said these things, he himself stayed in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore sought him on the festival day and said: Where is he?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Yet no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spoke openly of him, for fear of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now, about the midst of the feast, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went up into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and taught.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> wondered, saying: How doth this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> letters, having never learned?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him, he shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the doctrine, whether it be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or whether I speak of myself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: but he that seeketh the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of him that sent him, he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and there is no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Did not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered and said: Thou hast a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Who seeketh to kill thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said to them: One work I have done: and you all wonder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Therefore, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> gave you <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> (not because it is of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but of the fathers): and on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a> you <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcise</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receive <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> may not be broken: are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at me, because I have healed the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Judge<!--</a>--> not according to the appearance: but <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Some therefore of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And behold, he speaketh openly: and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> for a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that this is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whence he is: but when the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> cometh, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, whence he is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore cried out in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, teaching and saying: You both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence I am. And I am not come of myself: but he that sent me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> him, because I am from him: and he hath sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But of the people many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him and said: When the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> cometh, shall he do more <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> than this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> doth?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> sent <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> to apprehend him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> You shall seek me and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">dispersed among the Gentiles</a> and teach the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me and shall not find me? And: Where I am, you cannot come?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And on the last, and great day of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->festivity<!--</a>-->, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> stood and cried, saying: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> thirst, let him come to me and drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in me, as the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> saith: Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> indeed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Others said: This is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. But some said: Doth the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> come out of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Doth not the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> say: That <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> cometh of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> the town where <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And some of them would have apprehended him: but no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> laid hands upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> The <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> therefore came to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> The <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> answered: Never did <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> speak like this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Hath any one of the rulers <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him, or of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> But this multitude, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not the law, are <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">accursed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> said to them (he that came to him by night, who was one of them):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> Doth our law judge any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless it first hear him and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he doth?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> They answered and said to him: Art thou also a <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a>?
