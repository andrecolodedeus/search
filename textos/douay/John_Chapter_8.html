<div class="h1a">The woman taken in adultery. Christ justifies his doctrine.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went unto <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount Olivet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And early in the morning he came again into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and all the people came to him. And sitting down he taught them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> bring unto him a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> taken in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: and they set her in the midst,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was even now taken in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the law commanded us to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> such a one. But what sayest thou?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said to them: He that is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> among you, let him first <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">cast a stone</a> at her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> alone remained, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> standing in the midst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> lifting up himself, said to her: <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a>, where are they that accused thee? Hath no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> condemned thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who said: No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Lord. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Again therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke to: them, saying: I am the light of the world. He that followeth me walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself. Thy testimony is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: for I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> whence I came and whither I go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> You <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> according to the flesh: I <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> not any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And if I do <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>-->, my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: because I am not alone, but I and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> that sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And in your law it is written that the testimony of two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> I am one that give testimony of myself: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> that sent me giveth testimony of me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> They said therefore to him: Where is thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: Neither me do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, nor my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. If you did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, perhaps you would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> These words <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke in the treasury, teaching in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Again therefore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: I go: and you shall seek me. And you shall die in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Whither I go, you cannot come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go you cannot come?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he said to them: You are from beneath: I am from above. You are of this world: I am not of this world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not that I am he, you shall die in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> They said therefore to him: Who art thou? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Many things I have to speak and to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> of you. But he that sent me, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And they understood not that he called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Father<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, then shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am he and that I do nothing of myself. But as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath taught me, these things I speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he that sent me is with me: and he hath not left me alone. For I do always the things that please him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> When he spoke these things, many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> indeed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall make you free.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> They answered him: We are the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: and we have never been slaves to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. How sayest thou: You shall be free?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say unto you that whosoever committeth <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the son abideth for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> I speak that which I have seen with my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> They answered and said to him: <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is our father. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith them: If you be the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, do the works of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But now you seek to kill me, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who have spoken the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to you, which I have heard of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> did not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Father<!--</a>-->, even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> therefore said to them: If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were your <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Father<!--</a>-->, you would indeed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me. For from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I proceeded and came. For I came not of myself: but he sent me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Why do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> You are of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: and the desires of your father you will do. He was a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murderer</a> from the beginning: and he stood not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">liar</a>, and the father thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> But if I say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Which of you shall convince me of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? If I say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to you, why do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> He that is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> heareth the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">words of God</a>. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore answered and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> and hast a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: I have not a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: but I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. And you have dishonoured me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> But I seek not my own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: there is one that seeketh and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgeth<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said: Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou hast a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is dead, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and thou sayest: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> Art thou greater than our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> who is dead? And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: If I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> myself, my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is nothing. It is my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorifieth</a> me, of whom you say that he is your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> him: but I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> him. And if I shall say that I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> him not, I shall be like to you, a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">liar</a>. But I do <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> him and do keep his word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it and was glad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old. And hast thou seen <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you, before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was made, <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">I AM</a>.</span>
