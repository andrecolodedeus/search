<div class="h1a">He gives sight to the man born blind.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> passing by, saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was blind from his birth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> asked him: Rabbi, who hath <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, that he should be born blind?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered: Neither hath this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, nor his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; but that the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be made manifest in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> When he had said these things, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and spread the clay upon his eyes,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And said to him: Go, wash in the <a href="../cathen/13792a.htm">pool of Siloe</a>, which is interpreted, <em>Sent</em>. He went therefore and washed: and he came seeing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The neighbours, therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He answered: That <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is called <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> made clay and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->anointed<!--</a>--> my eyes and said to me: Go to the <a href="../cathen/13792a.htm">pool of Siloe</a> and wash. And I went: I washed: and I see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> They bring him that had been blind to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now it was the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> made the clay and opened his eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Again therefore the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> asked him how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes: and I washed: and I see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Some therefore of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> said: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who keepeth not the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>. But others said: How can a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is a sinner do such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? And there was a division among them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> They say therefore to the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened thy eyes? And he said: He is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> then did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of him that had received his sight,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> answered them and said: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is our son and that he was born blind:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But how he now seeth, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: or who hath opened his eyes, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Ask himself: he is of age: Let him speak for himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> These things his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> said, because they feared the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had already agreed among themselves that if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should confess him to be <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, he should be put out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Therefore did his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> say: He is of age. Ask himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> They therefore called the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> again that had been blind and said to him: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a sinner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. One thing I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that whereas I was blind now I see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard. Why would you hear it again? Will you also become his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> They <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">reviled</a> him therefore and said: Be thou his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>; but we are the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: but as to this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not from whence he is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> answered and said to them: why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> doth not hear sinners: but if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be a server of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and doth his, will, him he heareth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath opened the eyes of one born blind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Unless this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he could not do anything.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> They answered and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> heard that they had cast him out. And when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he said: I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, Lord. And falling down, he <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: For <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> I am come into this world: that they who see not may see; and they who see may become blind. <span class="stiki"><strong>I am come, etc...</strong> Not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came for that end, that any one should be made blind: but that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, by the abuse of his coming, and by their not receiving him, brought upon themselves this <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of blindness.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And some of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: If you were blind, you should not have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but now you say: We see. Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remaineth. <span class="stiki"><strong>If you were blind, etc...</strong> If you were invincibly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and had neither read the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>, nor seen my <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, you would not be guilty of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of infidelity: but now, as you boast of your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>, you are inexcusable.</span></span></p>
