<div class="h1a">Jonas being sent to preach in Niniveh, flees away by sea: a tempest rises: of which he being found, by lot, to be the cause, is cast into the sea, which thereupon is calmed.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>-->, the son of Amathi, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Arise and go to Ninive, the great city, and preach in it: For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> thereof is come up before me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Ninive...</strong> The capital city of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> empire.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>--> rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he went down to <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tharsis from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <span class="stiki"><strong>Tharsis...</strong> Which some take to be Tharsus of Cilicia, others to be Tartessus of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, others to be Carthage.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent a great wind to the sea: and a great tempest was <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->raised<!--</a>--> in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the mariners were afraid, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> cried to their god: and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to lighten it of them: and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>--> went down into the inner part of the ship, and fell into a deep sleep. <span class="stiki"><strong>A deep sleep...</strong> This is a lively image of the insensibility of sinners, fleeing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and threatened on every side with his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgments<!--</a>-->: and yet sleeping as if they were secure.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the shipmaster came to him and said to him: Why art thou fast asleep? rise up call upon thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if so be that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will think of us that we may not perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they said every one to his fellow: Come and let us cast lots, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is upon us, what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou? or of what people art thou?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to them: I am a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrew</a>, and I fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, who made both the sea and the dry land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast thou done this? (For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he fled from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: because he had told them.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they said to him: What shall we do with thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said to them: take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> rowed hard to return to the land, but they were not able: because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: We beseech thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> let us not perish for this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, hast done as it pleased thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they took <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>-->, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from raging.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> feared the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> exceedingly, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> victims to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and made <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.</span></p>
