<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>--> the second time saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Arise, and go to Ninive, the great city: and preach in it the preaching that I bid thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>--> arose, and went to Ninive, according to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>: now Ninive was a great city of three days' journey. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of three days' journey...</strong> By the computation of some ancient historians, Ninive was about fifty miles round: so that to go through all the chief streets and public places was three days' journey.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>--> began to enter into the city one day's journey: and he cried and said: Yet forty days and Ninive shall be destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Ninive <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and they proclaimed a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>, and put on <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a> from the greatest to the least.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the word came to the king of Ninive: and he rose up out of his throne, and cast away his robe from him, and was clothed in <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, and sat in ashes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published in Ninive, from the mouth of the king and of his princes, saying: Let neither <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> nor beasts, oxen, nor sheep taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And let <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and beasts be covered with <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, and cry to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with all their strength, and let them turn every one from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way, and from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> that is in their hands.</span>
