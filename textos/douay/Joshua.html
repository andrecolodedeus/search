<h1>Joshua</h1>

<p>This book is called <em>Joshua</em> (<em>Josue</em>), because it contains the history of what passed under <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and according to the common opinion was written by him. The Greeks call him <em>Jesus</em>: for <em>Joshua</em> and <em>Jesus</em> in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, are the same <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and have the same signification, viz., <em>a saviour</em>. And it was not without a mystery that he who was to bring the people into the land of promise should have his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> changed from <em>Osee</em> (for so he was called before, <a href="../douay/num013.htm#verse17">Numbers 13:17</a>), to <em>Joshua</em> or <em>Jesus</em>, to give us to understand, that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> could only bring the people within sight of the promised inheritance, but that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour Jesus</a> was to bring us into it. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">JOSUE</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/jos001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> Josue, encouraged by the Lord, admonisheth the people to prepare themselves to pass over the Jordan.
<br><a href="../douay/jos002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> Two spies are sent to Jericho, who are received and concealed by Rahab.
<br><a href="../douay/jos003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> The river Jordan is miraculously dried up for the passage of the children of Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/jos004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Twelve stones are taken out of the river to be set up for a monument of the miracle; and other twelve are placed in the midst of the river.
<br><a href="../douay/jos005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> The people are circumcised: they keep the pasch. The manna ceaseth. An angel appeareth to Josue.
<br><a href="../douay/jos006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> After seven days' processions, the priests sounding the trumpets, the walls of Jericho fall down: and the city is taken and destroyed.
<br><a href="../douay/jos007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> For the sins of Achan, the Israelites are defeated at Hai. The offender is found out; and stoned to death, and God's wrath is turned from them.
<br><a href="../douay/jos008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> Hai is taken and burnt, and all the inhabitants slain. An altar is built, and sacrifices offered. The law is written on stones, and the blessings and cursings are read before all the people.
<br><a href="../douay/jos009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> Josue is deceived by the Gabaonites: who being detected are condemned to be perpetual servants.
<br><a href="../douay/jos010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> Five kings war against Gabaon. Josue defeateth them: many are slain with hailstones. At the prayer of Josue the sun and moon stand still the space of one day. The five kings are hanged. Divers cities are taken.
<br><a href="../douay/jos011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> The kings of the north are overthrown: the whole country is taken.
<br><a href="../douay/jos012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> A list of the kings slain by Moses and Josue,
<br><a href="../douay/jos013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> God commandeth Josue to divide the land: the possessions of Ruben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses, beyond the Jordan.
<br><a href="../douay/jos014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> Caleb's petition; Hebron is given to him and to his seed.
<br><a href="../douay/jos015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> The borders of the lot of Juda. Caleb's portion and conquest. The cities of Juda.
<br><a href="../douay/jos016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> The lot of the sons of Joseph. The borders of the tribe of Ephraim.
<br><a href="../douay/jos017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> The lot of the half tribe of Manasses.
<br><a href="../douay/jos018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> Surveyors are sent to divide the rest of the land into seven tribes. The lot of Benjamin.
<br><a href="../douay/jos019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> The lots of the tribes of Simeon, Zabulon, Issachar, Aser, Nephtali and Dan. A city is given to Josue.
<br><a href="../douay/jos020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> The cities of refuge are appointed for casual manslaughter.
<br><a href="../douay/jos021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> Cities with their suburbs are assigned for the priests and Levites.
<br><a href="../douay/jos022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> The tribes of Ruben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses return to their possessions. They build an altar by the side of the Jordan, which alarms the other tribes. An embassage is sent to them, to which they give a satisfactory answer.
<br><a href="../douay/jos023.htm"><strong>Chapter 23.</strong></a> Josue being old admonisheth the people to keep God's commandments: and to avoid marriages and all society with the Gentiles for fear of being brought to idolatry.
<br><a href="../douay/jos024.htm"><strong>Chapter 24.</strong></a> Josue assembleth the people, and reneweth the covenant between them and God. His death and burial.
