<div class="h1a">Five kings war against Gabaon. Joshua defeats them: many are slain with hailstones. At the prayer of Joshua the sun and moon stand still the space of one day. The five kings are hanged. Divers cities are taken.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> When Adonisedec, king of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, had heard these things, to wit, that <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he had done to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> and the king thereof, so did he to Hai and its king) and that the Gabaonites were gone over to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and were their confederates,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Therefore Adonisedec, king of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, sent to Oham, king of <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, and to Pharam, king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia, king of Lachis, and to Dabir, king of Eglon, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon, because it hath gone over to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So the five kings of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a> being assembled together, went up: the king of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and camped about Gabaon, laying siege to it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon, which was besieged, sent to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him: Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants: come up quickly, and save us, and bring us succour: for all the kings of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, who dwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> went up from Galgal, and all the army of the warriors with him, most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands: none of them shall be able to stand against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> going up from Galgal all the night, came upon them suddenly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> troubled them, at the sight of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and he slew them with a great slaughter, in Gabaon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent to Bethoron, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and Maceda.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when they were fleeing from the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and were in the descent of Bethoron, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> cast down upon them great stones from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as far as Azeca: and many more were killed with the hailstones, than were slain by the swords of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> spoke to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, in the day that he delivered the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and he said before them:k</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem">2Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the valley of Ajalon.</blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"></span>
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>? So the sun stood still in the midst of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and hasted not to go down the space of one day. <span class="stiki"><strong>The book of the just...</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Jasher</em>: an ancient book long since lost.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> There was not before, nor after, so long a day, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the voice of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and fighting for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> returned, with all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, into the camp of Galgal.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave of the city of Maceda.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And it was told <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, that the five kings were found hid in a cave of the city of Maceda.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he commanded them that were with him, saying: Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to keep them shut up:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill all the hindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> hath delivered into your hands, to shelter themselves in their cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost utterly consumed, they that were able to escape from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, entered into fenced cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And all the army returned to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, in Maceda, where the camp then was, in good health, and without the loss of any one: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> durst move his tongue against the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> gave orders, saying: Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the ministers did as they were commanded: and they brought out to him the five kings out of the cave: the king of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when they were brought out to him, he called all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him: Go, and set your feet on the necks of these kings. And when they had gone, and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and be strong: for so will the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> do to all your enemies, against whom you fight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five gibbets; and they hung until the evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take them down from the gibbets. And after they were taken down, they cast them into the cave, where they had lain hid, and put great stones at the mouth thereof, which remain until this day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> The same day <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> took Maceda, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof: he left not in it the least remains. And he did to the king of Maceda, as he had done to the king of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he passed from Maceda with all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to Lebna, and fought against it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword, and all the inhabitants thereof. They left not in it any remains. And they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and investing it with his army, besieged it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered Lachis into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and he took it the following day, and put it to the sword, and every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that was in it, as he had done to Lebna.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> At that time Horam, king of Gazer, came up to succour Lachis: and <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> slew him with all his people so as to leave none alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded it,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And took it the same day: and put to the sword all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that were in it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> He went up also with all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from Eglon to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, and fought against it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword: the king also thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that dwelt in it: he left not therein any remains: as he had done to Eglon, so did he also to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, putting to the sword all that he found in it. <span class="stiki"><strong>The king...</strong> Viz., the new king, who succeeded him that was slain, verse 26.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Returning from thence to Dabir,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> He took it, and destroyed it: the king also thereof, and all the towns round about, he destroyed with the edge of the sword: he left not in it any remains: as he had done to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> and Lebna, and to their kings, so did he to Dabir, and to the king thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> So <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> conquered all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings: he left not any remains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, had commanded him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Any remains therein, but slew, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordered these people to be utterly destroyed, in punishment of their manifold abomination; and that they might not draw the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> into the like <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> From <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cadesbarne</a> even to <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>. All the land of Gosen even to Gabaon,</span>
