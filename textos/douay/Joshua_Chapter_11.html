<h1>Joshua Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">The kings of the north are overthrown: the whole country is taken.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when Jabin king of Asor had heard these things, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Semeron, and to the king of Achsaph:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And to the kings of the north, that dwelt in the mountains and in the plains over against the south side of Ceneroth, and in the levels and the countries of Dor by the sea side:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> To the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a> also on the east and on the west, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and the Pherezite, and the Jebusite in the mountains: to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of <a href="../cathen/07288a.htm">Hermon</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">land of Maspha</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they all came out with their troops, a people exceeding numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore, their horses also and chariots a very great multitude,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And all these kings assembled together at the waters of Merom, to fight against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: Fear them not: for tomorrow at this same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: thou shalt hamstring their horses, and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so ordained, that his people might not trust in chariots and horses, but in him.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> came, and all the army with him, against them to the waters of Merom on a sudden, and fell upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered them into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And they defeated them, and chased them as far as the great <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a> and the waters of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the east thereof. He slew them all, so as to leave no remains of them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he did as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him, he hamstringed their horses and burned their chariots.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And presently turning back he took Asor: and slew the king thereof with the sword. Now Asor of old was the head of all these kingdoms.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he cut off all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that abode there: he left not in it any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the city itself with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the cities round about, and their kings, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Except the cities that were on hills and high places, the rest <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> burned: only Asor that was very strong he consumed with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> divided among themselves all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, killing all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> his servant, so did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> command <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and he accomplished all: he left not one thing undone of all the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> took all the country of the hills, and of the south, and the land of Gosen, and the plains and the west country, and the mountain of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the plains thereof:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir as far as Baalgad, by the plain of Libanus under <a href="../cathen/07288a.htm">mount Hermon</a>: all their kings he took, smote and slew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> a long time against these kings. <span class="stiki"><strong>A long time...</strong> Seven years, as appears from <a href="../douay/jos014.htm#verse10">Joshua 14:10</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> There was not a city that delivered itself to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon: for he took all by fight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For it was the sentence of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that their hearts should be hardened, and they should fight against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and fall, and should not deserve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hardened...</strong> This hardening of their hearts, was their having no thought of yielding or submitting: which was a sentence or judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon them in punishment of their enormous crimes.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> came and cut off the Enacims from the mountains, from <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the mountain of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and destroyed their cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He left not any of the stock of the Enacims, in the land of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: except the cities of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and Geth, and <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, in which alone they were left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> So <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> took all the land, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and delivered it in possession to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, according to their divisions and <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>. And the land rested from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>.</span></p>
