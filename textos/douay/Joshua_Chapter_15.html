<div class="h1a">The borders of the lot of Judah. Caleb's portion and conquest. The cities of Judah.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the lot of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> by their kindreds was this: From the frontier of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Sin southward, and to the uttermost part of the south coast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Its beginning was from the top of the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">most salt sea</a>, and from the bay thereof, that looketh to the south.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And it goeth out towards the ascent of the Scorpion, and passeth on to <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Sina</a>: and ascendeth into <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cadesbarne</a>, and reacheth into Esron, going up to Addar, and compassing Carcaa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And from thence passing along into Asemona, and reaching the torrent of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and the bounds thereof shall be the great sea, this shall be the limit of the south coast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But on the east side the beginning shall be the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">most salt sea</a> even to the end of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: and towards the north from the bay of the sea unto the same <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">river Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the border goeth up into Beth-Hagla, and passeth by the north into Beth-Araba: going up to the stone of Boen the son of <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And reaching as far as the borders of Debara from the <a href="../cathen/01103a.htm">valley of Achor</a>, and so northward looking towards Galgal, which is opposite to the ascent of Adommin, on the south side of the torrent, and the border passeth the waters that are called the fountain of the sun: and the goings out thereof shall be at the fountain Rogel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And it goeth up by the valley of the son of Ennom on the side of the Jebusite towards the south, the same is <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and thence ascending to the top of the mountain, which is over against Geennom to the west in the end of the valley of Raphaim, northward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And it passeth on from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the water of Nephtoa: and reacheth to the towns of mount Ephron: and it bendeth towards Baala, which is Cariathiarim, that is to say, the city of the woods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And it compasseth from Baala westward unto mount Seir: and passeth by the side of mount Jarim to the north into Cheslon: and goeth down into Bethsames, and passeth into Thamna.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And reacheth northward to a part of <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a> at the side: and bendeth to Sechrona, and passeth mount Baala: and cometh into Jebneel, and is bounded westward with the great sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> These are the borders round about of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> in their kindreds.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But to <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb the son of Jephone</a> he gave a portion in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him: Cariath-Arbe the father of Enac, which is <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a> destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac, Sesai and Ahiman, and Tholmai of the race of Enac.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And going up from thence he came to the inhabitants of Dabir, which before was called Cariath-Sepher, that is to say, the city of letters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a> said: He that shall smite Cariath-Sepher, and take it, I will give him Axa my daughter <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">to wife</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>, took it: and he gave him Axa his daughter <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">to wife</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And as they were going together, she was moved by her husband to ask a field of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and she sighed as she sat on her ass. And <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a> said to her: What aileth thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But she answered: Give me a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>: thou hast given me a southern and dry land, give me also a land that is watered. And <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a> gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> This is the possession of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of the children of Juda</a> by their kindreds.</span>
