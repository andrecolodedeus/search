<div class="h1a">The lot of the half tribe of Manasseh.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And this lot fell to the tribe of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> (for he is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>) to Machir the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> the father of Galaad, who was a warlike <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and had for possession Galaad and Basan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And to the rest of the children of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> according to their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>: to the children of Abiezer, and to the children of Helec, and to the children of Esriel, and to the children of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sechem</a>, and to the children of Hepher, and to the children of Semida: these are the male children of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, by their kindreds.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But Salphaad the son of Hepher the son of Galaad the son of Machir the son of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> had no sons, but only daughters: whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> are these, Maala and Noa and Hegla and Melcha and Thersa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they came in the presence of <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>, and of the princes, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that a possession should be given us in the midst of our brethren. And he gave them according to the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> a possession amongst the brethren of their father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And there fell ten portions to <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, beside the land of Galaad and Basan beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For the daughters of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> possessed inheritance in the midst of his sons. And the land of Galaad fell to the lot of the rest of the children of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the border of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> was from <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Aser</a>, Machmethath which looketh towards <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>: and it goeth out on the right hand by the inhabitants of the fountain of Taphua.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For the lot of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> took in the land of Taphua, which is on the borders of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and belongs to the children of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the border goeth down to the valley of the reeds, to the south of the torrent of the cities of Ephraim, which are in the midst of the cities of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>: the border of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> is on the north side of the torrent, and the outgoings of it are at the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">sea</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So that the possession of Ephraim is on the south, and on the north that of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">sea</a> is the border of both, and they are joined together in the <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">tribe of Aser</a> on the north, and in the <a href="../cathen/08201a.htm">tribe of Issachar</a> on the east.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> in <a href="../cathen/08201a.htm">Issachar</a> and in <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Aser</a>, was <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a> and its <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>, and Jeblaam with its <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>, and the inhabitants of Dor, with the towns thereof: the inhabitants also of Endor with the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> thereof: and in like manner the inhabitants of Thenac with the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> thereof: and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a> with their <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>, and the third part of the city of Nopheth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Neither could the children of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> overthrow these cities, but the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> began to dwell in his land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But after that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> were grown strong, they subdued the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, and made them their tributaries, and they did not kill them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">children of Joseph</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and said: Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess, whereas I am of so great a multitude, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to them: If thou be a great people, go up into the woodland, and cut down room for thyself in the land of the Pherezite and the Raphaims: because the possession of mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">children of Joseph</a> answered him: We cannot go up to the mountains, for the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a> that dwell in the low lands, wherein are situate <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a> with its towns, and Jezrael in the midst of the valley, have chariots of iron.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">house of Joseph</a>, to Ephraim and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>: Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not have one lot only:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But thou shalt pass to the mountain, and shalt cut down the wood, and make thyself room to dwell in: and mayst proceed farther, when thou hast destroyed the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, who as thou sayest have iron chariots, and are very strong.</span></p>
