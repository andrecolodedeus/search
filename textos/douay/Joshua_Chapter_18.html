<div class="h1a">Surveyors are sent to divide the rest of the land into seven tribes. The lot of Benjamin.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> assembled together in Silo, and there they set up the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>, and the land was subdued before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But there remained seven <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of the children of Israel</a>, which as yet had not received their possessions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to them: How long are you indolent and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slack</a>, and go not in to possess the land which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers hath given you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Choose of every <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> three <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that I may send them, and they may go and compass the land, and mark it out according to the number of each multitude: and bring back to me what they have marked out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Divide to yourselves the land into seven parts: let <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> be in his bounds on the south side, and the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">house of Joseph</a> on the north.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The land in the midst between these mark ye out into seven parts; and you shall come hither to me, that I may cast lots for you before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The land in the midst between these mark ye out into seven parts...</strong> That is to say, the rest of the land, which is not already assigned to <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> or <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> have no part among you, but the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is their inheritance. And <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a> and <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">half tribe of Manasses</a> have already received their possessions beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> eastward: which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were risen up, to go to mark out the land, <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> commanded them saying: Go round the land and mark it out, and return to me: that I may cast lots for you before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in Silo.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So they went and surveying it divided it into seven parts, writing them down in a book. And they returned to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, to the camp in Silo.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he cast lots before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in Silo, and divided the land to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> into seven parts.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And first came up the lot of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> by their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, to possess the land between the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">children of Joseph</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And their border northward was from the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: going along by the side of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> on the north side, and thence going up westward to the mountains, and reaching to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Bethaven,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And passing along southward by Luza, the same is <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and it goeth down into Ataroth-addar to the mountain, that is on the south of the nether Beth-horon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And it bendeth thence going round towards the sea, south of the mountain that looketh towards Beth-horon to the southwest: and the outgoings thereof are into Cariathbaal, which is called also Cariathiarim, a city of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> This is their coast towards the sea, westward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But on the south side the border goeth out from part of Cariathiarim towards the sea, and cometh to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And it goeth down to that part of the mountain that looketh on the valley of the children of Ennom: and is over against the north quarter in the furthermost part of the valley of Raphaim, and it goeth down into Geennom (that is the valley of Ennom) by the side of the Jebusite to the south: and cometh to the fountain of Rogel,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Passing thence to the north, and going out to Ensemes, that is to say, the fountain of the sun:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And it passeth along to the hills that are over against the ascent of Adommim: and it goeth down to Abenboen, that is, the stone of Boen the son of <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>: and it passeth on the north side to the champaign countries; and goeth down into the plain,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And it passeth by Bethhagla northward: and the outgoings thereof are towards the north of the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">most salt sea</a> at the south end of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Which is the border of it on the east side. This is the possession of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> by their borders round about, and their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And their cities were, <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> and Bethhagla and Vale-Casis,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Betharaba and Samaraim and <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Avim and Aphara and Ophera,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The town Emona and Ophni and Gabee: twelve cities, and their <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>.</span>
