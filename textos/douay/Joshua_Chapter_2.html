<h1>Joshua Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Two spies are sent to Jericho, who are received and concealed by Rahab.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua, the son of Nun</a>, sent from <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">Setim</a> two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to spy secretly: and said to them: Go, and view the land, and the city of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. They went, and entered into the house of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that was a harlot, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Rahab, and lodged with her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And it was told the king of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and was said: Behold there are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> come in hither, by night, of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, to spy the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the king of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> sent to Rahab, saying: Bring forth the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that came to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they are spies, and are come to view all the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> taking the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, hid them, and said: I confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they were:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went out together. I know not whither they are gone: pursue after them quickly, and you will overtake them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But she made the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> go up to the top of her house, and covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that leadeth to the fords of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: and as soon as they were gone out, the gate was presently shut.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were hid were not yet asleep, when behold the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> went up to them, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> I know that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given this land to you: for the dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> We have heard that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> dried up the water of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, at your going in, when you came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and what things you did to the two kings of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, that were beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, Sehon and Og whom you slew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And at the hearing these things, we were affrighted, and our heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us, at your coming in: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> above, and in the earth beneath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> ye to me by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that as I have showed mercy to you, so you also will show mercy to my father's house: and give me a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> token.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> That you will save my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, my brethren and sisters, and all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> that are theirs, and deliver our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou betray us not. And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall have delivered us the land, we will show thee mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then she let them down with a cord out of a window: for her house joined close to the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days, till they come back, and so you shall go on your way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which thou hast made us <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> If, when we come into the land, this scarlet cord be a sign, and thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us down: and gather together thy <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, and brethren, and all thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a> into thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we shall be quit. But the blood of all that shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon our head, if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> touch them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall be quit of this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which thou hast made us <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done: and sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three days, till they that pursued them were returned. For having sought them through all the way, they found them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned, and came down from the mountain: and passing over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, they came to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua, the son of Nun</a>, and told him all that befell them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And said: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered all this land into our hands, and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear.</span></p>
