<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when a long time was passed, after that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had given peace to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> round about being subdued and <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> being now old, and far advanced in years:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> called for all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for the elders, and for the princes, and for the judges, and for the masters, and said to them: I am old, and far advanced in years,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And you see all that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> hath done to all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> round about, how he himself hath fought for you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And now since he hath divided to you by lot all the land, from the east of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> unto the great sea, and many <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> yet remain:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> will destroy them, and take them away from before your face, and you shall possess the land as he hath <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Only take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and be careful to observe all things that are written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">book of the law of Moses</a>: and turn not aside from them neither to the right hand nor to the left:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Lest after that you are come in among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who will remain among you, you should <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a>, and serve them, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But cleave ye unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, as you have done until this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And then the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> will take away before your eyes <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> that are great and very strong, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be able to resist you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> One of you shall chase a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the enemies: because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> himself will fight for you, as he hath <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> This only take care of with all diligence, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But if you will embrace the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of these <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> that dwell among you, and make <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriages</a> with them, and join friendships:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Know ye for a certainty that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> will not destroy them before your face, but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way, and a stumbling-block at your side, and stakes in your eyes, till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which he hath given you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Behold this day I am going into the way of all the earth, and you shall know with all your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that of all the words which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to perform for you, not one hath failed,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed, what he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>, and all things prosperous have come: so will he bring upon you all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> he hath threatened, till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which he hath given you,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> When you shall have transgressed the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, which he hath made with you, and shall have served <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> them: then shall the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">indignation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> rise up quickly and speedily against you, and you shall be taken away from this excellent land, which he hath delivered to you.</span></p>
