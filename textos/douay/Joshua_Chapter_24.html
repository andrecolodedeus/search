<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> gathered together all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> in <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, and called for the ancients, and the princes and the judges, and the masters: and they stood in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he spoke thus to the people: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">river</a>, Thare the father of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Nachor: and they <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">served strange gods</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of the river...</strong> The Euphrates.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I took your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> from the borders of Mesopotamia: and brought him into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>: and I multiplied his seed,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And gave him <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>: and to him again I gave <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>. And I gave to <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> mount Seir for his possession: but <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">his children</a> went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I sent <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and I struck <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I brought you and your fathers out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and you came to the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">sea</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen, as far as the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and he put darkness between you and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them. Your eyes saw all that I did in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and you dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> a long time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I brought you into the land of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, who dwelt beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. And when they fought against you, I delivered them into your hands, and you possessed their land, and slew them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Balac son of Sephor king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> arose and fought against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he sent and called for <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam son of Beor</a>, to <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I would not hear him, but on the contrary I <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> you by him, and I delivered you out of his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And you passed over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and you came to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that city fought against you, the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and the Pherezite, and the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and the Gergesite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite: and I delivered them into your hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I sent before you and I drove them out from their places, the two kings of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, not with thy sword nor with thy bow,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I gave you a land, in which you had not laboured, and cities to dwell in which you built not, vineyards and oliveyards, which you planted not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now therefore fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and serve him with a <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> and most sincere heart: and put away the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> which your fathers served in Mesopotamia and in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But if it seem <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to you to serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, you have your choice: choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you would rather serve, whether the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> which your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house we will serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the people answered, and said, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid we should leave the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and serve <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> he brought us and our fathers out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, out of the house of <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a>: and did very great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> in our sight, and preserved us in all the way by which we journeyed, and among all the people through whom we passed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he hath cast out all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a> the inhabitant of the land into which we are come. Therefore we will serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for he is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to the people: You will not be able to serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for he is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and mighty and jealous, and will not forgive your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>You will not be able to serve the Lord, etc...</strong> This was not said by way of discouraging them; but rather to make them more earnest and resolute, by setting before them the greatness of the undertaking, and the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and constancy necessary to go through with it.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> If you leave the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and serve <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>, he will turn, and will afflict you, and will destroy you after all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he hath done you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the people said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: No, it shall not be so as thou sayest, but we will serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to the people, You are witnesses, that you yourselves have chosen you the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to serve him. And they answered: We are witnesses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now therefore, said he, put away <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a> from among you, and incline your hearts to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> therefore on that day made a covenant, and set before the people <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> and judgments in <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he wrote all these things in the volume of the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and he took a great stone, and set it under the oak that was in the sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he said to all the people: Behold this stone shall be a testimony unto you, that it hath heard all the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he hath spoken to you: lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it, and <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>It hath heard...</strong> This is a figure of speech, by which sensation is attributed to inanimate things; and they are called upon, as it were, to bear witness in favour of the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, whom they on their part constantly <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he sent the people away every one to their own possession,</span></p>
