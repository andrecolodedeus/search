<h1>Joshua Chapter 3</h1>
<div class="h1a">The river Jordan is miraculously dried up for the passage of the children of Israel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> rose before daylight, and removed the camp: and they departed from <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">Setim</a>, and came to the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: he, and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and they abode there for three days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> After which, the heralds went through the midst of the camp,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And began to proclaim: When you shall see the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord your God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">race of Levi</a> carrying it, rise you up also, and follow them as they go before:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And let there be between you and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> the space of two thousand cubits: that you may see it afar off, and know which way you must go: for you have not gone this way before: and take care you come not near the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to the people: Be ye <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>: for tomorrow the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will do wonders among you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: Take up the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a>, and go before the people. And they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> his commands, and took it up, and walked before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: This day will I begin to exalt thee before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: that they may know that as I was with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, so I am with thee also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And do thou command the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that carry the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a>, and say to them: When you shall have entered into part of the water of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, stand in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: Come hither, and hear the word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And again he said: By this you shall know, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy, before your sight, the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, the Hevite and the Pherezite, the Gergesite also, and the Jebusite, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Behold, the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> of all the earth shall go before you into the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Prepare ye twelve <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, one of every <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that carry the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the whole earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off: and those that come from above, shall stand together upon a heap.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So the people went out of their tents, to pass over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a>, went on before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And as soon as they came into the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and their feet were dipped in part of the water, (now the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, it being harvest time, had filled the banks of its channel),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The waters that came down from above stood in one place, and swelling up like a mountain, were seen afar off, from the city that is called Adom, to the place of Sarthan: but those that were beneath, ran down into the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">sea of the wilderness</a>, (which now is called the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">Dead Sea</a>) until they wholly failed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the people marched over against <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>, stood girded upon the dry ground in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and all the people passed over, through the channel that was dried up.</span></p>
