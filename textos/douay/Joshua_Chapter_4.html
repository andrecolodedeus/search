<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when they were passed over, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Choose twelve <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, one of every <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And command them to take out of the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, where the feet of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stood, twelve very hard stones, which you shall set in the place of the camp, where you shall pitch your tents this night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> called twelve <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whom he had chosen out of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, one out of every <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to them: Go before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and carry from thence every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a stone on your shoulders, according to the number of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> That it may be a sign among you: and when your children shall ask you tomorrow, saying: What means these stones?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> You shall answer them: The waters of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> ran off before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> when it passed over the same: therefore were these stones set for a monument of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> forever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> therefore did as <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> commanded them, carrying out of the channel of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> twelve stones, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him according to the number of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> unto the place wherein they camped, and there they set them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stood that carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a>: and they are there until this present day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, stood in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, till all things were accomplished, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> to speak to the people, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had said to him. And the people made haste, and passed over.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when they had all passed over, the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> also of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> passed over, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> went before the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">children of Ruben</a> also, and <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">half the tribe of Manasses</a>, went armed before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had commanded them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And forty thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by their troops and bands, marched through the plains and fields of the city of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> In that day the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> magnified <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that they should fear him, as they had feared <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, while he lived.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Command the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that carry the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a>, to come up out of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when they that carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>, were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters returned into their channel, and ran as they were wont before.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the people came up out of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, the tenth day of the first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of the city of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the twelve stones, which they had taken out of the channel of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> pitched in Galgal,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And said to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: When your children shall ask their fathers tomorrow, and shall say to them: What mean these stones?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> You shall teach them, and say: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> passed over this <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> through the dry channel,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> drying up the waters thereof in your sight, until you passed over:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> As he had done before in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, which he dried up till we passed through:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that you also may fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> for ever.</span></p>
