<div class="h1a">The people are circumcised: they keep the pasch. The manna ceases. An angel appears to Joshua.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now when all the kings of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, who dwelt beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, westward, and all the kings of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, who possessed the places near the great sea, had heard that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had dried up the waters of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, till they passed over, their heart failed them, and there remained no spirit in them, fearing the coming in of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> At that time the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: Make thee knives of stone, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcise</a> the second time the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The second time...</strong> Not that such as had been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> before were to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> again; but that they were now to renew, and take up again the practice of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; which had been omitted during their forty years' sojourning in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>; by reason of their being always uncertain when they should be obliged to march.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He did what the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded, and he <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> in the hill of the foreskins.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now this is the cause of the second <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>: All the people that came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that were males, all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> fit for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, died in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, during the time of the long going about in the way:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now these were all <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. But the people that were born in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> During the forty years of the journey in the wide <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, were uncircumcised: till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and to whom he had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> before, that he would not show them the land flowing with milk and honey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers, and were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> by <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: for they were uncircumcised even as they were born, and no one had <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> them in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now after they were all <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, they remained in the same place of the camp, until they were healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: This day have I taken away from you the reproach of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place was called Galgal, until this present day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> abode in Galgal, and they kept the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">phase</a>, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the plains of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they ate on the next day <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened bread</a> of the corn of the land, and frumenty of the same year.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> ceased after they ate of the corn of the land, neither did the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> use that food any more, but they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> was in the field of the city of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, he lifted up his eyes, and saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> standing over against him, holding a drawn sword, and he went to him, and said: Art thou one of ours, or of our adversaries?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he answered: No: but I am <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">prince of the host of the Lord</a>, and now I am come. <span class="stiki"><strong>Prince of the host of the Lord, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a>, who is called prince of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> [<a href="../douay/dan010.htm#verse21">Daniel 10:21</a>].</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> fell on his face to the ground. And <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">worshipping</a>, said: What saith my lord to his servant? <span class="stiki"><strong>Worshipping...</strong> Not with <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">divine honour</a>, but with a <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">religious veneration of an inferior kind</a>, suitable to the dignity of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Loose, saith he, thy shoes from off thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> did as was commanded him.</span></p>
