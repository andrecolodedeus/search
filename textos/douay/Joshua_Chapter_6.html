<h1>Joshua Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">After seven days' processions, the priests sounding the trumpets, the walls of Jericho fall down: and the city is taken and destroyed.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> durst go out or come in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: Behold I have given into thy hands <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and the king thereof, and all the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Go round about the city all ye fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> once a day: so shall ye do for six days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And on the seventh day the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> shall take the seven trumpets, which are used in the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a>, and shall go before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a>: and you shall go about the city seven times, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> shall sound the trumpets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua, the son of Nun</a>, called the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and said to them: Take the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant</a>: and let seven other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> take the seven trumpets of the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a>, and march before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city, armed, marching before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> had ended his words, and the seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> blew the seven trumpets before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And all the armed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went before, the rest of the common people followed the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> had commanded the people, saying: You shall not shout, nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your mouth: until the day come wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and shout.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> So the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a> went about the city once a day, and returning into the camp, abode there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> rising before day, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> took the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a>: and they went before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>, walking and sounding the trumpets: and the armed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went before them, and the rest of the common people followed the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, and they blew the trumpets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they went round about the city the second day once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as it was ordered, seven times.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when in the seventh going about the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sounded with the trumpets, <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Shout: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered the city to you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And let this city be an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, and all things that are in it, to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Let only Rahab, the harlot, live, with all that are with her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we sent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">forbidden</a>, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> be under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and be troubled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass and iron, let it be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, laid up in his treasures.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the walls forthwith fell down: and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went up by the place that was over against him: and they took the city,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And killed all that were in it, man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, young and old. The oxen also, and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the sword.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to the two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that had been sent for spies: Go into the harlot's house, and bring her out, and all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> that are hers, as you assured her by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the young men went in, and brought out Rahab, and her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, her brethren also, and all her <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>, and her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>, and made them to stay without the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But they burned the city, and all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> that were therein; except the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> unto the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> saved Rahab the harlot, and her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">house</a>, and all she had, and they dwelt in the midst of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> until this present day: because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. At that time, <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> made an <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">imprecation</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that shall raise up and build the city of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. In his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> may he lay the foundation thereof, and in the last of his children set up its gates. <span class="stiki"><strong>Cursed, etc...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, in the mystical sense, signifies <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>: the sounding of the trumpets by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the preaching of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; by which the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> are thrown down, when sinners are <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>; and a dreadful <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> will light on them who build them up again.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was noised throughout all the land.</span></p>
