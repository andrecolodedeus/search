<div class="h1a">For the sins of Achan, the Israelites are defeated at Hai. The offender is found out; and stoned to death, and God's wrath is turned from them.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> transgressed the commandment, and took to their own use of that which was <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">accursed</a>. For Achan, the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>, took something of the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> sent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> against Hai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of the town of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, he said to them: Go up, and view the country: and they fulfilled his command, and viewed Hai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And returning, they said to him: Let not all the people go up, but let two or three thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> go, and destroy the city: why should all the people be troubled in vain, against enemies that are very few?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> There went up therefore three thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: who immediately turned their backs,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And were defeated by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the city of Hai, and there fell of them six and thirty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and the enemies pursued them from the gate as far as Sabarim, and they slew them as they fled by the descent: and the heart of the people was struck with fear, and melted like water.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground, before the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the Lord</a>, until the evening, both he and all the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and they put dust upon their heads.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said: Alas, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, why wouldst thou bring this people over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">river Jordan</a>, to deliver us into the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and to destroy us? would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we had stayed beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, as we began.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, what shall I say, seeing <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> turning their backs to their enemies?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, and all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of it, and being gathered together will surround us, and cut off our <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: Arise, why liest thou flat on the ground?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and transgressed my covenant: and they have taken of the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> and <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lied</a>, and have hid it among their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Neither can <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> stand before his enemies, but he shall flee from them: because he is defiled with the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. I will be no more with you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Arise, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">sanctify</a> the people, and say to them: Be ye <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> against tomorrow: for thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: The <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> is in the midst of thee, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, till he be destroyed out of thee, that is defiled with this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And you shall come in the morning, every one by your <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>: and what <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its kindreds, and the kindred by its houses and the house by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact, he shall be burnt with fire, with all his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>, because he hath transgressed the covenant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and hath done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to come by their <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a> was found.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Which being brought by in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, it was found to be the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Zare. Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to be Zabdi:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And bringing his house <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he found Achan, the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said to Achan: My son, give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Achan answered <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and said to him: Indeed I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and thus and thus have I done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment, exceeding <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and two hundred sicles of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sicles: and I <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> them, and I <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">took them away</a>, and hid them in the ground in the midst of my tent, and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> therefore sent ministers: who running to his tent, found all hid in the same place, together with the silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and to all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and threw them down before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with him, took Achan, the son of Zare, and the silver, and the garment, and the golden rule, his sons also, and his daughters, his oxen, and asses, and sheep, the tent also, and all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>: and brought them to the <a href="../cathen/01103a.htm">valley of Achor</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>His sons, etc...</strong> Probably conscious to, or <a href="../cathen/01100a.htm">accomplices</a> of, the crime of their father.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Where <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> said: Because thou hast troubled us, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> trouble thee this day. And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him: and all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> that were his, were consumed with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day And the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was turned away from them. And the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place was called the <a href="../cathen/01103a.htm">Valley of Achor</a>, until this day. <span class="stiki"><strong>Achor...</strong> That is, trouble.</span></span></p>
