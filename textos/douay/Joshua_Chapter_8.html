<div class="h1a">Hai is taken and burnt, and all the inhabitants slain. An altar is built, and sacrifices offered. The law is written on stones, and the blessings and cursings are read before all the people.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: Fear not, nor be thou dismayed: take with thee all the multitude of fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, arise, and go up to the town of Hai: Behold I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof, and the people, and the city, and the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king thereof, as thou hast done to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and to the king thereof: but the spoils, and all the cattle, you shall take for a prey to yourselves: lay an ambush for the city behind it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> arose, and all the army of the fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him, to go up against Hai: and he sent thirty thousand chosen <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the night,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And commanded them, saying: Lay an ambush behind the city: and go not very far from it: and be ye all ready.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But I, and the rest of the multitude which is with me, will approach on the contrary side against the city. And when they shall come out against us, we will flee, and turn our backs, as we did before:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city: for they will think that we flee as before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursuing, you shall rise out of the ambush, and shall destroy the city: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> will deliver it into your hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and you shall do all things so as I have commanded.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he sent them away, and they went on to the place of the ambush, and abode between <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> and Hai, on the west side of the city of Hai. But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> staid that night in the midst of the people,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And rising early in the morning, he mustered his soldiers, and went up with the ancients in the front of the army, environed with the aid of the fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when they were come, and were gone up over against the city, they stood on the north side of the city, between which and them there was a valley in the midst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he had chosen five thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and set them to lie in ambush between <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> and Hai, on the west side of the same city: <span class="stiki"><strong>Five thousand...</strong> These were part of the thirty thousand mentioned above, verse 3.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north side, so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the city. So <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> went that night, and stood in the midst of the valley.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste in the morning, and went out with all the army of the city, and set it in battle array, toward the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> gave back, making as if they were afraid, and fleeing by the way of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But they shouting together, and encouraging one another, pursued them. And when they were come from the city,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And not one remained in the city of Hai and of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, that did not pursue after <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, leaving the towns open as they had rushed out,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>: Lift up the shield that is in thy hand, towards the city of Hai, for I will deliver it to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city, the ambush, that lay hid, rose up immediately: and going to the city, took it, and set it on fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the city, that pursued after <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, looking back, and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, had no more power to flee this way or that way: especially as they that had counterfeited flight, and were going toward the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, turned back most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiantly</a> against them that pursued.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> So <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, seeing that the city was taken, and that the smoke of the city rose up, returned, and slew the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Hai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they also that had taken and set the city on fire, issuing out of the city to meet their own <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, began to cut off the enemies who were surrounded by them. So that the enemies being cut off on both sides, not one of so great a multitude was saved.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they took the king of the city of Hai alive and brought him to <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> So all being slain that had pursued after <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in his flight to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and falling by the sword in the same place, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> returned and laid waste the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the number of them that fell that day, both of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, was twelve thousand persons, all of the city of Hai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> drew not back his hand, which he had stretched out on high, holding the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> divided among them, the cattle and the prey of the city, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he burnt the city, and made it a heap forever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet, until the evening and the going down of the sun. Then <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> commanded, and they took down his carcass from the gibbet: and threw it in the very entrance of the city, heaping upon it a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> built an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in Mount Hebal,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> As <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the servant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, had commanded the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and it is written in the book of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>: an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of unhewn stones, which iron had not touched: and he offered upon it <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">immolated</a> victims of peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he wrote upon stones, the <a href="../cathen/04761b.htm">Deuteronomy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, which he had ordered before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes, and judges, stood on both sides of the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that carried the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a>, both the stranger and he that was born among them, half of them by Mount Garizim, and half by Mount Hebal, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, had commanded. And first he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> After this, he read all the words of the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursing</a>, and all things that were written in the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">book of the law</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> He left out nothing of those things which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had commanded, but he repeated all before all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, and strangers, that dwelt among them.</span></p>
