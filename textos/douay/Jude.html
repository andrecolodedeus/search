<div class="h1a">The Catholic Epistle of St. Jude</div>

<p>St. Jude, who wrote this Epistle, was one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and brother to <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">St. James the Less</a>. The time it was written is uncertain: only it may be inferred from <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->verse<!--</a>--> 17 that few or none of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> were then living, except <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>. He inveighs against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> practices of the Simonians, <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, etc., describing them and their leaders by strong epithets and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->similes<!--</a>-->, He exhorts the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to contend earnestly for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> first delivered to them and to beware of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.
