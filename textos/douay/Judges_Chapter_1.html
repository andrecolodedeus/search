<div class="h1a">The expedition and victory of Judah against the Canaanites: who are tolerated in many places.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After the death of <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: Who shall go up before us against the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and shall be the leader of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> shall go up: behold I have delivered the land into his hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said to <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>, his brother: Come up with me into my lot, and fight against the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, that I also may go along with thee into thy lot. And <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a> went with him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> went up, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and the Pherezite into their hands: and they slew of them in Bezec ten thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they found Adonibezec in Bezec, and fought against him, and they defeated the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and the Pherezite.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Adonibezec fled: and they pursued after him and took him, and cut off his fingers and toes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Adonibezec said: Seventy kings, having their fingers and toes cut off, gathered up the leavings of the meat under my table: as I have done, so hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requited me. And they brought him to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and he died there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> besieging <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, took it, and put it to the sword, and set the whole city on fire. <span class="stiki"><strong>Jerusalem...</strong> This city was divided into two; one part was called Jebus, the other Salem: the one was in the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>, the other in the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>. After it was taken and burnt by the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, it was quickly rebuilt again by the Jebusites, as we may gather from verse 21; and continued in their possession till it was taken by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And afterwards they went down and fought against the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, who dwelt in the mountains, and in the south, and in the plains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> going forward against the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, that dwelt in <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, (the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> whereof was in former times Cariath-Arbe) slew Sesai, and Ahiman, and Tholmai: <span class="stiki"><strong>Hebron...</strong> This expedition against <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, etc. is the same as is related, <a href="../douay/jos015.htm#verse24">Joshua 15:24</a>. It is here repeated, to give the reader at once a short sketch of all the achievements of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And departing from thence, he went to the inhabitants of Dabir, the ancient <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of which was Cariath-Sepher, that is, the city of letters. <span class="stiki"><strong>The city of letters...</strong> Perhaps so called from some famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, kept there.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a> said: He that shall take Cariath-Sepher, and lay it waste, to him will I give my daughter Axa <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">to wife</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Othoniel, the son of Cenez, the younger brother of <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>, having taken it, he gave him Axa his daughter <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">to wife</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And as she was going on her way, her husband admonished her to ask a field of her father. And as she sighed sitting on her ass, <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a> said to her: What aileth thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But she answered: Give me a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, for thou hast given me a dry land: give me also a watery land So <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a> gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the children of the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinite</a>, the kinsman of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, went up from the city of palms, with the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a>, into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of his lot, which is at the south side of Arad, and they dwelt with him. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Cinite...</strong> Jethro the father in <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> was called Cinoeus, or the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinite</a>; and his children who came along with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> settled themselves among them in the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, embracing their <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>. From these the <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechabites</a> sprung, of whom see <a href="../douay/jer035.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>. Ibid. <strong>The city of palms...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, so called from the abundance of palm trees.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> went with <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>, his brother, and they together defeated the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a> that dwelt in Sephaath, and slew them. And the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the city was called Horma, that is, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">Anathema</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> took <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, with its confines, and <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01093b.htm">Accaron</a>, with their confines. <span class="stiki"><strong>Gaza, etc...</strong> These were three of the principal cities of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, famous both in sacred and profane history. They were taken at this time by the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>: but as they took no care to put garrisons in them, the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> soon recovered them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, and he possessed the hill country: but was not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley, because they had many chariots armed with scythes. <span class="stiki"><strong>Was not able, etc...</strong> Through a cowardly fear of their chariots armed with hooks and scythes, and for want of confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they gave <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> to <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had said, who destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">sons of Benjamin</a> did not destroy the Jebusites that inhabited <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and the Jebusite hath dwelt with the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">sons of Benjamin</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> until this present day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">house of Joseph</a> also went up against <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For when they were besieging the city, which before was called Luza,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> They saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> coming out of the city, and they said to him: Show us the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when he had showed them, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and all his kindred, they let go:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Who being sent away, went into the land of Hetthim, and built there a city, and called it <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Luza</a>: which is so called until this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> also did not destroy <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Bethsan</a>, and Thanac, with their <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>; nor the inhabitants of Dor, and Jeblaam, and <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a>, with their <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> began to dwell with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But after <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was grown strong, he made them tributaries, and would not destroy them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Ephraim also did not slay the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> that dwelt in Gazer, but dwelt with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a> destroyed not the inhabitants of Cetron, and Naalol: but the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> dwelt among them, and became their tributary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Aser</a> also destroyed not the inhabitants of Accho, and of <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a>, of Ahalab, and of Achazib, and of Helba, and of Aphec, and of Rohob:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he dwelt in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, the inhabitants of that land, and did not slay them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthali</a> also destroyed not the inhabitants of Bethsames, and of Bethanath: and he dwelt in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, the inhabitants of the land, and the Bethsamites and <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethanites</a> were tributaries to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a> straitened the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">children of Dan</a> in the mountain, and gave them not a place to go down to the plain:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he dwelt in the mountain Hares, that is, of potsherds, in Aialon and Salebim. And the hand of the <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">house of Joseph</a> was heavy upon him, and he became tributary to him. <span class="stiki"><strong>He dwelt...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the border of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a> was from the ascent of the scorpion, the rock, and the higher places.</span></p>
