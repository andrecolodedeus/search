<div class="h1a">Jephte is made ruler of the people of Gilead: he first pleads their cause against the Ammonites; then making a vow obtains a signal victory; he performs his vow.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> There was at that time <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>, the Galaadite, a most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and a warrior, the son of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that was a harlot, and his father was Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons: who, after they were grown up, thrust out <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>, saying: Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father, because thou art born of another mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then he fled and avoided them, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered to him <!--<a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">-->needy<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and robbers, and they followed him as their prince.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> In those days the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And as they pressed hard upon them, the ancients of Galaad went to fetch <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> out of the land of Tob to help them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they said to him: Come thou, and be our prince, and fight against the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he answered them: Are not you the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me, and cast me out of my father's house, and now you are come to me, constrained by necessity?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the princes of Galaad said to <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>: For this cause we are now come to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and fight against the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> also said to them: If you be come to me sincerely, that I should fight for you against the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall deliver them into my hand, shall I be your prince?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They answered him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who heareth these things, he himself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> therefore went with the princes of Galaad, and all the people made him their prince. And <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> spoke all his words before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he sent messengers to the king of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, to say in his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me, to waste my land?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he answered them: Because <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> took away my land, when he came up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from the confines of the Arnon unto the Jaboc and the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: now, therefore, restore the same peaceably to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> again sent word by them, and commanded them to say to the king of <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammon</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thus saith <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did not take away the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, nor the land of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But when they came up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he walked through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, and came into <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he sent messengers to the king of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, saying: Suffer me to pass through thy land. But he would not condescend to his request. He sent also to the king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, who, likewise, refused to give him passage. He abode, therefore, in <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And went round the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">land of Edom</a> at the side, and the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: and came over against the east coast of the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and camped on the other side of the Arnon: and he would not enter the bounds of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> So <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> sent messengers to Sehon, king of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and they said to him: Suffer me to pass through thy land to the river.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But he, also despising the words of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, suffered him not to pass through his borders: but gathering an infinite multitude, went out against him to Jasa, and made strong opposition.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered him, with all his army, into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and he slew him, and possessed all the land of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, the inhabitant of that country,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the Jaboc, and from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> So the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, destroyed the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, his people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> fighting against him, and wilt thou now possess his land?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Are not those things which thy god Chamos possesseth, due to thee by right? But what the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> hath obtained by conquest, shall be our possession: <span class="stiki"><strong>Chamos...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> and <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>. He argues from their opinion, who thought they had a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> title to the countries which they imagined they had conquered by the help of their gods: how much more then had <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in indisputable title to the countries which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, had conquered for them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Unless, perhaps, thou art better than Balac, the son of Sephor, king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: or canst show that he strove against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and fought against him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Whereas he hath dwelt in <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> thereof, and in Aroer, and its <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>, and in all the cities near the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, for three hundred years. Why have you for so long a time attempted nothing about this claim?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Therefore I do not trespass against thee, but thou wrongest me by declaring an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against me. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be judge, and decide this day, between <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the king of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> would not hearken to the words of <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>, which he sent him by the messengers.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>, and going round Galaad, and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha of Galaad</a>, and passing over from thence to the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> He made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: If thou wilt deliver the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> into my hands,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of my house, and shall meet me, when I return in peace from the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, the same will I offer a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Whosoever, etc...</strong> Some are of opinion, that the meaning of this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>, was to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whatsoever should first meet him, according to the condition of the thing; so as to offer it up as a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, if it were such a thing as might be offered by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>; or to devote it otherwise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if it were not such as the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> allowed to be offered in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. And therefore they think the daughter of <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> was not slain by her father, but only <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But the common opinion followed by the generality of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">holy fathers</a> and divines is, that she was offered as a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, in consequence of her father's <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: and that <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, at least not mortally, neither in making, nor in keeping, his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>: since he is no ways blamed for it in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>; and was even <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself to make the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> (as appears from verses 29 and 30) in consequence of which he obtained the victory; and therefore he reasonably concluded that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the master of life and death, was pleased on this occasion to dispense with his own <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>; and that it was the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> he should fulfil his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> passed over to the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> to fight against them: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered them into his hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he smote them from Aroer till you come to Mennith, twenty cities, and as far as <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">Abel</a>, which is set with vineyards, with a very great slaughter: and the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> were <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> returned into <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>, to his house, his only daughter met him with timbrels and with <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dances</a>: for he had no other children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when he saw her, he rent his garments, and said: Alas! my daughter, thou hast <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceived</a> me, and thou thyself art <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceived</a>: for I have opened my mouth to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I can do no other thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And she answered him: My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised, since the victory hath been granted to thee, and revenge of thy enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And she said to her father: Grant me only this, which I desire: Let me go, that I may go about the mountains for two months, and may bewail my <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> with my companions. <span class="stiki"><strong>Bewail my virginity...</strong> The bearing of children was much <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> under the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, when <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> might hope that from some child of theirs, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Saviour of the world</a> might one day spring. But under the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is preferred. <a href="../douay/1co007.htm#verse35">1 Corinthians 7:35</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he answered her: Go. And he sent her away for two months. And when she was gone with her comrades and companions, she mourned her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in the mountains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And the two months being expired, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a>, and she knew no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. From thence came a fashion in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> has been kept:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> That, from year to year, the daughters of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> assemble together, and lament the daughter of <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a> the Galaadite, for four days.</span></p>
