<h1>Judges Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Ephraimites quarrel with Jephte: forty-two thousand of them are slain: Abeson, Ahialon, and Abdon, are judges.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But behold there arose a sedition in Ephraim. And passing towards the north, they said to <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>: When thou wentest to fight against the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, why wouldst thou not call us, that we might go with thee? Therefore we will burn thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he answered them: I and my people were at great strife with the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>: and I called you to assist me, and you would not do it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when I saw this, I put my life in my own hands, and passed over against the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered them into my hands. What have I deserved, that you should rise up to fight against me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then calling to him all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Galaad, he fought against Ephraim: and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Galaad defeated Ephraim, because he had said: Galaad is a fugitive of Ephraim, and dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim and <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the Galaadites secured the fords of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, by which Ephraim was to return. And when any one of the number of Ephraim came thither in the flight, and said: I beseech you let me pass: the Galaadites said to him: Art thou not an Ephraimite? If he said: I am not:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> They asked him: Say then, <em>Scibboleth</em>, which is interpreted, <em>An ear of corn</em>. But he answered, <em>Sibboleth</em>, not being able to express an ear of corn by the same letter. Then presently they took him and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> him in the very passage of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. And there fell at that time of Ephraim, two and forty thousand.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte</a>, the Galaadite, judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> six years: and he died, and was buried in his city of Galaad.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> After him Abesan of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He had thirty sons, and as many daughters, whom he sent abroad, and gave to husbands, and took wives for his sons, of the same number, bringing them into his house. And he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> seven years:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he died, and was buried in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> To him succeeded Ahialon, a <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulonite</a>: and he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> ten years:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he died, and was buried in <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> After him, Abdon, the son of Illel, a Pharathonite, judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he had forty sons, and of them thirty grandsons, mounted upon seventy ass colts, and he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> eight years:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he died, and was buried in Pharathon, in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of Amalech.</span></p>
