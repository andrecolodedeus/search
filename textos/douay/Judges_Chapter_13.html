<h1>Judges Chapter 13</h1>
<div class="h1a">The people fall again into idolatry and are afflicted by the Philistines. An angel foretells the birth of Samson.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> again in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and he delivered them into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> forty years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now there was a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of Saraa, and of the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">race of Dan</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Manue, and his wife was barren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> appeared to her, and said: Thou art barren and without children: but thou shalt conceive and bear a son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now therefore beware, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Because thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, and no razor shall touch his head: for he shall be a <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarite</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from his infancy, and from his mother's womb, and he shall begin to deliver <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when she was come to her husband, she said to him: A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came to me, having the countenance of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, very awful. And when I asked him whence he came, and by what <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> he was called, he would not tell me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But he answered thus: Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son: beware thou drink no wine, nor strong drink, nor eat any <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> thing: for the child shall be a <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarite</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from his infancy, from his mother's womb until the day of his death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then Manue <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: I beseech thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom thou didst send, may come again, and teach us what we ought to do concerning the child, that shall be born.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Manue, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> appeared again to his wife, as she was sitting in the field. But Manue her husband was not with her. And when she saw the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> She made haste, and ran to her husband: and told him, saying: Behold the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath appeared to me, whom I saw before.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He rose up, and followed his wife: and coming to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, said to him: Art thou he that spoke to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? And he answered: I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Manue said to him: When thy word shall come to pass, what wilt thou that the child should do? or from what shall he keep himself?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> said to Manue: From all the things I have spoken of to thy wife, let her refrain herself: <span class="stiki"><strong>Let her refrain, etc...</strong> By the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> text it is not clear whether this <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstinence</a> was prescribed to the mother, or to the child; but the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> (in which the verbs relating thereto are of the feminine gender) determineth it to the mother. But then the child also was to refrain from the like things, because he was to be from his infancy a <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarite</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, verse 5, that is, one set aside, in a particular manner, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: now the <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarites</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> were to <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstain</a> from all these things.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> thing: and whatsoever I have commanded her, let her fulfil and observe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Manue said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a>: I beseech thee to consent to my request, and let us dress a kid for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answered him: If thou press me I will not eat of thy bread: but if thou wilt offer a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, offer it to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And Manue knew not it was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said to him: What is thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, that, if thy word shall come to pass, we may honour thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he answered him: Why askest thou my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, which is wonderful?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then Manue took a kid of the flocks, and the libations, and put them upon a rock, <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who doth wonderful things: and he and his wife looked on.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when the flame from the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> went up towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> ascended also in the same. And when Manue and his wife saw this, they fell flat on the ground;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> appeared to them no more. And forthwith Manue understood that it was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said to his wife: We shall certainly die, because we have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Seen God...</strong> Not in his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">messenger</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, in those days, imagined they should die if they saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, taking occasion perhaps from those words spoken by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../douay/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus 33:20</a>, No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall see me and live. But the event demonstrated that it was but a groundless imagination.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And his wife answered him: If the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had a mind to kill us, he would not have received a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> and libations at our hands; neither would he have showed us all these things, nor have told us the things that are to come.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And she bore a son, and called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>. And the child grew, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> began to be with him in the camp of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, between Saraa and Esthaol.</span></p>
