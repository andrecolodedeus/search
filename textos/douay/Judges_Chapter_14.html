<h1>Judges Chapter 14</h1>
<div class="h1a">Samson desires a wife of the Philistines. He kills a lion: in whose mouth he afterwards finds honey. His marriage feast, and riddle, which is discovered by his wife. He kills, and strips thirty Philistines. His wife takes another man.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> went down to Thamnatha, and seeing there a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the daughters of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying: I saw a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in Thamnatha of the daughters of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: I beseech you, take her for me <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">to wife</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And his father and mother said to him: Is there no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou wilt <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">take a wife</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, who are uncircumcised? And <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> said to his father: Take this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for me; for she hath pleased my eyes. <span class="stiki"><strong>Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren...</strong> This shows his parents were at first against his <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> with a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, it being prohibited, <a href="../douay/deu007.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>; but afterwards they consented, knowing it to be by the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which otherwise would have been <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in acting contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and that he sought an occasion against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: for at that time the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had dominion over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> went down with his father and mother to Thamnatha. And when they were come to the vineyards of the town, behold a young lion met him, raging and roaring.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>, and he tore the lion as he would have torn a kid in pieces, having nothing at all in his hand: and he would not tell this to his father and mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he went down, and spoke to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that had pleased his eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And after some days, returning to take her, he went aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold there was a swarm of bees in the mouth of the lion, and a honey-comb.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when he had taken it in his hands, he went on eating: and coming to his father and mother, he gave them of it, and they ate: but he would not tell them that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So his father went down to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and made a feast for his son <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>: for so the young men used to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when the citizens of that place saw him, they brought him thirty companions to be with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> said to them: I will propose to you a riddle, which if you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty shirts, and as many coats:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But if you shall not be able to declare it, you shall give me thirty shirts and the same number of coats. They answered him: Put forth the riddle, that we may hear it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not for three days expound the riddle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when the seventh day came, they said to the wife of <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>: Sooth thy husband, and persuade him to tell thee what the riddle meaneth. But if thou wilt not do it, we will burn thee, and thy <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house. Have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So she wept before <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> and complained, saying: Thou <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatest</a> me, and dost not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me: therefore thou wilt not expound to me the riddle, which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people. But he answered: I would not tell it to my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>: and how can I tell it to thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> So she wept before him the seven days of the feast: and, at length, on the seventh day, as she was troublesome to him, he expounded it. And she immediately told her countrymen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they, on the seventh day before the sun went down, said to him: What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them: If you had not ploughed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon him, and he went down to <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, and slew there thirty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whose garments he took away, and gave to them that had declared the riddle. And being exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, he went up to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But his wife took one of his friends and bridal companions for her husband.</span></p>
