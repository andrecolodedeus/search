<h1>Judges Chapter 15</h1>
<div class="h1a">Samson is denied his wife. He burns the corn of the Philistines, and kills many of them.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And a while after, when the days of the wheat harvest were at hand, <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> came, meaning to visit his wife, and he brought her a kid of the flock. And when he would have gone into her chamber, as usual, her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> would not suffer him, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I thought thou hadst <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> her, and therefore I gave her to thy friend: but she hath a sister, who is younger and fairer than she, take her to wife instead of her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> answered him: From this day I shall be blameless in what I do against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>: for I will do you <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he went and caught three hundred foxes, and coupled them tail to tail, and fastened torches between the tails: <span class="stiki"><strong>Foxes...</strong> Being judge of the people he might have many to assist him to catch with nets or otherwise a number of these animals; of which there were great numbers in that country.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And setting them on fire he let the foxes go, that they might run about hither and thither. And they presently went into the standing corn of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. Which being set on fire, both the corn that was already carried together, and that which was yet standing, was all burnt, insomuch that the flame consumed also the vineyards and the oliveyards.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> said: Who hath done this thing? And it was answered: <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>, the son in law of the Thamnathite, because he took away his wife, and gave her to another, hath done these things. And the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> went up and burnt both the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> said to them: Although you have done this, yet will I be revenged of you, and then I will be quiet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he made a great slaughter of them, so that in astonishment they laid the calf of the leg upon the thigh. And going down he dwelt in a cavern of the rock Etam.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> going up into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, camped in the place which afterwards was called Lechi, that is, the <em>Jawbone</em>, where their army was spread abroad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a> said to them: Why are you come up against us? They answered: We are come to bind <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>, and to pay him for what he hath done against us.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Wherefore three thousand <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a> went down to the cave of the rock Etam, and said to <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>: Knowest thou not that the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> rule over us? Why wouldst thou do thus? And he said to them: As they did to me, so have I done to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they said to him: We are come to bind thee, and to deliver thee into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. And <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> said to them: <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">Swear</a> to me, and promise me that you will not <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> They said: We will not <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> thee: but we will deliver thee up bound. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him from the rock Etam.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone, and the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> shouting went to meet him, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came strongly upon him: and as flax is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And finding a jawbone, even the jawbone of an ass, which lay there, catching it up, he slew therewith a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he said: With the jawbone of an ass, with the jaw of the colt of asses, I have destroyed them, and have slain a thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when he had ended these words, singing, he threw the jawbone out of his hand, and called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place Ramathlechi, which is interpreted <em>the lifting up of the jawbone</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And being very thirsty, he cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: Thou hast given this very great deliverance and victory into the hand of thy servant: and behold I die for thirst, and shall fall into the hands of the uncircumcised.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass and waters issued out of it. And when he had drunk them, he refreshed his spirit, and recovered his strength. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place was called <em>The Spring of him that invoked from the jawbone</em>, until this present day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in the days of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, twenty years.</span></p>
