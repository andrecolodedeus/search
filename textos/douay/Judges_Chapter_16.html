<h1>Judges Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">Samson is deluded by Dalila: and falls into the hands of the Philistines. His death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> He went also into <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and saw there a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a harlot, and went in unto her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had heard this, and it was noised about among them, that <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> was come into the city, they surrounded him, setting guards at the gate of the city, and watching there all the night in silence, that in the morning they might <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him as he went out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> slept till midnight, and then rising, he took both the doors of the gate, with the posts thereof and the bolt, and laying them on his shoulders, carried them up to the top of the hill, which looketh towards <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> After this he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who dwelt in the valley of Sorec, and she was called <a href="../cathen/04605a.htm">Dalila</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Dalila...</strong> Some are of opinion she was <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> to <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>; others that she was his harlot. If the latter opinion be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we cannot wonder that, in punishment of his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered him up, by her means, into the hands of his enemies. However if he was guilty, it is not to be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> but that under his afflictions he heartily <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repented</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so obtained <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">forgiveness</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> came to her, and said: <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">Deceive</a> him, and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth, and how we may be able to overcome him, to bind and afflict him: which if thou shalt do, we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/04605a.htm">Dalila</a> said to <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>: Tell me, I beseech thee, wherein thy greatest strength lieth, and what it is, wherewith if thou wert bound, thou couldst not break loose.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> answered her: If I shall be bound with seven cords, made of sinews not yet dry, but still moist, I shall be weak like other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> brought unto her seven cords, such as he spoke of, with which she bound him;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Men lying privately in wait with her, and in the chamber, expecting the event of the thing, and she cried out to him: The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> are upon thee, <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>. And he broke the bands, as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would break a thread of tow twined with spittle, when it smelleth the fire: so it was not known wherein his strength lay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/04605a.htm">Dalila</a> said to him: Behold thou hast mocked me, and hast told me a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">false thing</a>: but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest be bound.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he answered her: If I shall be bound with new ropes, that were never in work, I shall be weak and like other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/04605a.htm">Dalila</a> bound him again with these, and cried out: The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> are upon thee, <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>, there being an ambush prepared for him in the chamber. But he broke the bands like threads of webs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/04605a.htm">Dalila</a> said to him again: How long dost thou <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceive</a> me, and tell me <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lies</a>? Show me wherewith thou mayest be bound. And <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> answered her: If thou plattest the seven locks of my head with a lace, and tying them round about a nail, fastenest it in the ground, I shall be weak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when <a href="../cathen/04605a.htm">Dalila</a> had done this, she said to him: The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> are upon thee, <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>. And awaking out of his sleep, he drew out the nail with the hairs and the lace.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/04605a.htm">Dalila</a> said to him: How dost thou say thou <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> me, when thy <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is not with me? Thou hast told me <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lies</a> these three times, and wouldst not tell me wherein thy greatest strength lieth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when she pressed him much, and continually hung upon him for many days, giving him no time to rest, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> fainted away, and was wearied even unto death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then opening the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the thing, he said to her: The razor hath never come upon my head, for I am a <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarite</a>, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from my mother's womb: If my head be shaven, my strength shall depart from me, and I shall become weak, and shall be like other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then seeing that he had discovered to her all his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, she sent to the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, saying: Come up this once more, for now he hath opened his heart to me. And they went up, taking with them the money which they had promised.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But she made him sleep upon her knees, and lay his head in her bosom. And she called a barber and shaved his seven locks, and began to drive him away, and thrust him from her: for immediately his strength departed from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And she said: The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> are upon thee, <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>. And awaking from sleep, he said in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: I will go out as I did before, and shake myself, not knowing that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was departed from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> seized upon him, and forthwith pulled out his eyes, and led him bound in chains to <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and shutting him up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> made him grind.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And now his hair began to grow again,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> assembled together, to offer great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/04602c.htm">Dagon</a> their god, and to make merry, saying: Our god hath delivered our enemy <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> into our hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the people also seeing this, praised their god, and said the same: Our god hath delivered our adversary into our hands, him that destroyed our country, and killed very many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And rejoicing in their feasts, when they had now taken their good cheer, they commanded that <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> should be called, and should play before them. And being brought out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, he played before them; and they made him stand between two pillars.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he said to the lad that guided his steps: Suffer me to touch the pillars which support the whole house, and let me lean upon them, and rest a little.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Now the house was full of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and all the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were there. Moreover about three thousand persons of both sexes, from the roof and the higher part of the house, were beholding <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson's</a> play.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But he called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> remember me, and restore to me now my former strength, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I may revenge myself on my enemies, and for the loss of my two eyes I may take one revenge. <span class="stiki"><strong>Revenge myself...</strong> This desire of revenge was out of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> against the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his people; and not out of private rancour and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of heart.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested, and holding the one with his right hand, and the other with his left,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> He said: Let me die with the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. And when he had strongly shook the pillars, the house fell upon all the princes, and the rest of the multitude, that was there: and he killed many more at his death, than he had killed before in his life. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let me die...</strong> Literally, let my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> die. <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on this occasion, though he was indirectly the cause of his own death. Because he was moved to what he did, by a <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">particular inspiration</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who also concurred with him by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, in restoring his strength upon the spot, in consequence of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a>, by dying in this manner, was a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who by his death overcame all his enemies.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And his brethren and all his kindred, going down took his body, and buried it between Saraa and Esthaol, in the buryingplace of his father Manue: and he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> twenty years.</span></p>
