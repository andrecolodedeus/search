<div class="h1a">The history of the idol of Michas, and the young Levite.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> There was at that time a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of mount Ephraim, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Who said to his mother: The eleven hundred pieces of silver, which thou hadst put aside for thyself, and concerning which thou didst <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> in my hearing, behold I have, and they are with me. And she said to him. <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be my son by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So he restored them to his mother, who said to him: I have <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a> this silver to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that my son may receive it at my hand, and make a <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven and a molten god</a>; so now I deliver it to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he restored them to his mother: and she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith, to make of them a <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven and a molten God</a>, which was in the house of <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he separated also therein a little <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">god</a>, and made an <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, and theraphim, that is to say, a <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">priestly garment</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: and he filled the hand of one of his sons, and he became his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Filled the hand...</strong> That is, appointed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priestly office</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> In those days there was no king in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but every one did that which seemed right to himself.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> There was also another young man of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem Juda</a>, of the kindred thereof: and he was a <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, and dwelt there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now he went out from the city of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and desired to sojourn wheresoever he should find it convenient for him. And when he was come to mount Ephraim, as he was on his journey, and had turned aside a little into the house of <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He was asked by him whence he came. And he answered: I am a <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem Juda</a>, and I am going to dwell where I can, and where I shall find a place to my advantage.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a> said: Stay with me, and be unto me a father and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and I will give thee every year ten pieces of silver, and a double suit of apparel, and thy victuals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He was content, and abode with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and was unto him as one of his sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a> filled his hand, and had the young man with him for his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now I know <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will do me <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, since I have a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the race of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>.</span></p>
