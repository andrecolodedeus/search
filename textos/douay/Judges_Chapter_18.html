<h1>Judges Chapter 18</h1>
<div class="h1a">The expedition of the men of Dan against Lais: in their way they rob Michas of his priest and his gods.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In those days there was no king in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">tribe of Dan</a> sought them an inheritance to dwell in: for unto that day they had not received their lot among the other <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Not received, etc...</strong> They had their portions assigned them, <a href="../douay/jos019.htm#verse40">Joshua 19:40</a>. But, through their own <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">sloth</a>, possessed as yet but a small part of it. See <a href="../douay/jdg001.htm#verse34">Judges 1:34</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> So the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">children of Dan</a> sent five most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of their stock and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, from Saraa and Esthaol, to spy out the land, and to view it diligently: and they said to them: Go, and view the land. They went on their way, and when they came to mount Ephraim, they went into the house of <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a>, and rested there:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And knowing the voice of the young man the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, and lodging with him, they said to him: Who brought thee hither? what dost thou here? why wouldst thou come hither?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He answered them: <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a> hath done such and such things for me, and hath hired me to be his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then they desired him to consult the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that they might know whether their journey should be prosperous, and the thing should have effect.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He answered them: Go in peace: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> looketh on your way, and the journey that you go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So the five <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> going on came to <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm#III">Lais</a>: and they saw how the people dwelt therein without any fear, according to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>, secure and easy, having no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at all to oppose them, being very rich, and living separated, at a distance from <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a> and from all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and Esthaol, who asked them what they had done: to whom they answered:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Arise, and let us go up to them: for we have seen the land which is exceeding rich and fruitful: neglect not, lose no time: let us go and possess it, there will be no difficulty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> We shall come to a people that is secure, into a spacious country, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will deliver the place to us, in which there is no want of any thing that groweth on the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> There went therefore of the kindred of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, to wit, from Saraa and Esthaol, six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, furnished with arms for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And going up they lodged in Cariathiarim of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: which place from that time is called the camp of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>, and is behind Cariathiarim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> From thence they passed into mount Ephraim. And when they were come to the house of <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The five <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that before had been sent to view the land of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm#III">Lais</a>, said to the rest of their brethren: You know that in these houses there is an <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> and theraphim, and a <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven and a molten god</a>: see what you are pleased to do.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when they had turned a little aside, they went into the house of the young man the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, who was in the house of <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a>: and they saluted him with words of peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> stood before the door, appointed with their arms.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But they that were gone into the house of the young man, went about to take away the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven god</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, and the theraphim, and the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">molten god</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> stood before the door, the six hundred <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> waiting not far off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> So they that were gone in took away the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven thing</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">molten god</a>, And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said to them: What are you doing?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they said to him: Hold thy peace, and put thy finger on thy mouth, and come with us, that we may have thee for a father, and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Whether is better for thee, to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the house of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or in a <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> When he heard this, he agreed to their words, and took the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven god</a>, and departed with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when they were going forward, and had put before them the children and the cattle, and all that was valuable,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And were now at a distance from the house of <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that dwelt in the houses of <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a> gathering together followed them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And began to shout out after them. They looked back, and said to <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a>: What aileth thee? Why dost thou cry?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he answered: You have taken away my <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> which I have made me, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and all that I have, and do you say: What aileth thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">children of Dan</a> said to him: See thou say no more to us, lest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> enraged come upon thee, and thou perish with all thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And so they went on the journey they had begun. But <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a> seeing that they were stronger than he, returned to his house.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> took the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the things we spoke of before, and came to <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm#III">Lais</a>, to a people that was quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword: and the city they burnt with fire,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> There being no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at all who brought them any succour, because they dwelt far from <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a>, and had no society or business with any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And the city was in the land of Rohob: and they rebuilt it, and dwelt therein,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Calling the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the city <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm#III">Dan</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of their father, who was the son of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which before was called <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm#III">Lais</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they set up to themselves the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">graven idol</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08499b.htm">Jonathan</a> the son of Gersam, the son of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he and his sons were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">tribe of Dan</a>, until the day of their <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">captivity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> of <a href="../cathen/10277b.htm">Michas</a> remained with them all the time that the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">house of God</a> was in Silo. In those days there was no king in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
