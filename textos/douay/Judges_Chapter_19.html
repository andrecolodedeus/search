<h1>Judges Chapter 19</h1>
<div class="h1a">A Levite bringing home his wife, is lodged by an old man at Gabaa in the tribe of Benjamin. His wife is there abused by wicked men, and in the morning found dead. Her husband cuts her body in pieces, and sends to every tribe of Israel, requiring them to revenge the wicked fact.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> There was a certain <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, who dwelt on the side of mount Ephraim, who took a wife of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem Juda</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And she left him, and returned to her father's house in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and abode with him four months.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And her husband followed her, willing to be reconciled with her, and to speak kindly to her, and to bring her back with him, having with him a servant and two asses: and she received him, and brought him into her father's house. And when his father in law had heard this, and had seen him, he met him with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And embraced the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And the son in law tarried in the house of his father in law three days, eating with him and drinking familiarly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But on the fourth day, arising early in the morning, he desired to depart. But his father in law kept him, and said to him: Taste first a little bread, and strengthen thy stomach, and so thou shalt depart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they sat down together, and ate and drank. And the father of the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to his son in law: I beseech thee to stay here to day, and let us make merry together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But he rising up, began to be for departing. And nevertheless his father in law earnestly pressed him, and made him stay with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But when morning was come, the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a> prepared to go on his journey. And his father in law said to him again: I beseech thee to take a little meat, and strengthening thyself, till the day be farther advanced, afterwards thou mayest depart. And they ate together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant. And his father in law spoke to him again: Consider that the day is declining, and draweth toward evening: tarry with me to day also, and spend the day in mirth, and tomorrow thou shalt depart, that thou mayest go into thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> His son in law would not consent to his words: but forthwith went forward, and came over against Jebus, which by another <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is called <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, leading with him two asses loaden, and his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Concubine...</strong> She was his lawful wife, but even lawful wives are frequently in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> called <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>. See above <a href="../douay/jdg008.htm#verse31">Judges 8:31</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And now they were come near Jebus, and the day was far spent: and the servant said to his master: Come, I beseech thee, let us turn into the city of the Jebusites, and lodge there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> His master answered him: I will not go into the town of another nation, who are not of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, but I will pass over to Gabaa:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when I shall come thither, we will lodge there, or at least in the city of Rama.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So they passed by Jebus, and went on their journey, and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gabaa, which is in the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they turned into it to lodge there. And when they were come in, they sat in the street of the city, for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would receive them to lodge.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And behold they saw an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, returning out of the field and from his work in the evening, and he also was of mount Ephraim, and dwelt as a stranger in Gabaa; but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that country were the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Jemini</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Jemini...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lifting up his eyes, saw the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sitting with his bundles in the street of the city, and said to him: Whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He answered him: We came out from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem Juda</a>, and we are going to our home, which is on the side of mount Ephraim, from whence we went to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>: and now we go to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">house of God</a>, and none will receive us under his roof:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> We have straw and hay for provender of the asses, and bread and wine for the use of myself and of thy handmaid, and of the servant that is with me: we want nothing but lodging.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> answered him: Peace be with thee: I will furnish all things that are necessary: only I beseech thee, stay not in the street.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he brought him into his house, and gave provender to his asses: and after they had <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed their feet</a>, he entertained them with a feast.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> While they were making merry, and refreshing their bodies with meat and drink, after the labour of the journey, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that city, sons of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> (that is, without yoke), came and beset the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> house, and began to knock at the door, calling to the master of the house, and saying: Bring forth the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that came into thy house, that we may abuse him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went out to them, and said: Do not so, my brethren, do not so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>: because this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is come into my lodging, and cease I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you from this folly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> I have a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">maiden</a> daughter, and this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>, I will bring them out to you, and you may <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> them, and satisfy your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: only, I beseech you, commit not this crime against nature on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> They would not be satisfied with his words; which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeing, brought out his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> to them, and abandoned her to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: and when they had abused her all the night, they let her go in the morning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, at the dawning of the day, came to the door of the house, where her lord lodged, and there fell down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And in the morning the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> arose, and opened the door, that he might end the journey he had begun: and behold his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> lay before the door with her hands spread on the threshold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> He thinking she was taking her rest, said to her: Arise, and let us be going. But as she made no answer, perceiving she was dead, he took her up, and laid her upon his ass, and returned to his house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when he was come home, he took a sword, and divided the dead body of his wife with her bones into twelve parts, and sent the pieces into all the borders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when every one had seen this, they all cried out: There was never such a thing done in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, from the day that our fathers came up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, until this day: give sentence, and decree in common what ought to be done.</span></p>
