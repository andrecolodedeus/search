<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Wherefore I would not destroy them from before your face; that you may have enemies, and their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> may be your ruin.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> spoke these words to all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: they lifted up their voice, and wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place was called, <em>The place of weepers</em>, or <em>of tears</em>: and there they offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, delivered them into the hands of plunderers: who took them and sold them to their enemies, that dwelt round about: neither could they stand against their enemies:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But whithersoever they meant to go, the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was upon them, as he had said, and as he had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to them: and they were greatly distressed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> raised up judges, to deliver them from the hands of those that oppressed them: but they would not hearken to them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Committing <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">fornication with strange gods</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoring</a> them. They quickly forsook the way, in which their fathers had walked: and hearing the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, they did all things contrary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> raised them up judges, in their days, he was moved to mercy, and heard the groanings of the afflicted, and delivered them from the slaughter of the oppressors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But after the judge was dead, they returned, and did much worse things than their fathers had done, following <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">strange gods</a>, serving them, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoring</a> them. They left not their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was kindled against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and he said: Behold this nation hath made void my covenant, which I had made with their fathers, and hath <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> to hearken to my voice:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I also will not destroy the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> which <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> left when he died:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> That through them I may try <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whether they will keep the way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> therefore left all these <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and would not quickly destroy them, neither did he deliver them into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>.</span></p>
