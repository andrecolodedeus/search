<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> went out, and gathered together as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, from <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a> to <a href="../cathen/02518a.htm">Bersabee</a>, with the land of Galaad, to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And all the chiefs of the people, and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, met together in the assembly of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, four hundred thousand footmen fit for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> (Nor were the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> were come up to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>.) And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, the husband of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> being asked, how so great a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> had been committed,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Answered: I came into Gabaa, of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, with my wife, and there I lodged:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And behold the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that city, in the night beset the house wherein I was, intending to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me, and abused my wife with an incredible fury of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, so that at last she died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I took her and cut her in pieces, and sent the parts into all the borders of your possession: because there never was so heinous a crime, and so great an abomination committed in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> You are all here, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, determine what you ought to do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And all the people standing, answered as by the voice of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: We will not return to our tents, neither shall any one of us go into his own house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But this we will do in common against Gabaa:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> We will take ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of a hundred out of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to bring victuals for the army, that we may fight against Gabaa of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, and render to it for its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, what it deserveth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were gathered together against the city, as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, with one mind, and one counsel:</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they sent messengers to all the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>, to say to them: Why hath so great an abomination been found among you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Deliver up the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Gabaa, that have committed this heinous crime, that they may die, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be taken away out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. But they would not hearken to the proposition of their brethren the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But out of all the cities which were of their lot, they gathered themselves together into Gabaa, to aid them, and to fight against the whole people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And there were found of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> five and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gabaa,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Who were seven hundred most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, fighting with the left hand as well as with the right: and slinging stones so sure that they could hit even a hair, and not miss by the stone's going on either side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> also, beside the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a>, were found four hundred thousand that drew swords and were prepared to fight.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they arose and came to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">house of God</a>, that is, to Silo: and they consulted <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: Who shall be in our army the first to go to the battle against the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a>? And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> answered them: Let <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> be your leader.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And forthwith the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> rising in the morning, camped by Gabaa:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And going out from thence to fight against <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, began to assault the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> coming out of Gabaa slew of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> that day two and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Again <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, trusting in their strength and their number, set their army in array in the same place, where they had fought before: <span class="stiki"><strong>Trusting in their strength...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> suffered them to be overthrown and many of them to be slain, though their cause was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>; partly in punishment of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> which they exercised or <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">tolerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">tribe of Dan</a>, and elsewhere; and partly because they trusted in their own strength; and therefore, though he bid them fight, he would not give them the victory, till they were thoroughly <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> and had learned to trust in him alone.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Yet so that they first went up and wept before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> until night: and consulted him and said: Shall I go out any more to fight against the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> my brethren or not? And he answered them: Go up against them, and join battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> went out the next day to fight against the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> sallied forth out of the gates of Gabaa: and meeting them, made so great a slaughter of them, as to kill eighteen thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that drew the sword.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Wherefore all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">house of God</a>, and sat and wept before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and they <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> that day till the evening, and offered to him <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and victims of peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And inquired of him concerning their state. At that time the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> was there,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And Phinees, the son of <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, was over the house. So they consulted the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said: Shall we go out any more to fight against the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a>, our brethren, or shall we cease? And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to them: Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> set ambushes round about the city of Gabaa:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they drew up their army against <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> the third time, as they had done the first and second.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> boldly issued out of the city, and seeing their enemies flee, pursued them a long way, so as to wound and kill some of them, as they had done the first and second day, whilst they fled by two highways, whereof one goeth up to <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> and the other to Gabaa, and they slew about thirty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> For they thought to cut them off as they did before. But they artfully feigning a flight, designed to draw them away from the city, and by their seeming to flee, to bring them to the highways aforesaid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Then all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> rising up out of the places where they were, set their army in battle array, in the place which is called Baalthamar. The ambushes also, which were about the city, began by little and little to come forth,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And to march from the west side of the city. And other ten thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> chosen out of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, attacked the inhabitants of the city. And the battle grew hot against the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a>: and they understood not that present death threatened them on every side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> defeated them before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and they slew of them in that day five and twenty thousand, and one hundred, all fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and that drew the sword.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a>, when they saw themselves to be too weak, began to flee. Which the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> seeing, gave them place to flee, that they might come to the ambushes that were prepared, which they had set near the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of their coverts, and whilst <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> turned their backs to the slayers, went into the city, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> had given a sign to them, whom they had laid in ambushes, that after they had taken the city, they should make a fire: that by the smoke rising on high, they might show that the city was taken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> saw this in the battle, (for the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> thought they fled, and pursued them vigorously, killing thirty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of their army)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And perceived, as it were, a pillar of smoke rise up from the city; and <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> looking back, saw that the city was taken, and that the flames ascended on high:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> They that before had made as if they fled, turning their faces, stood bravely against them. Which the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> seeing, turned their backs,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And began to go towards the way of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, the enemy pursuing them thither also. And they that fired the city came also out to meet them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And so it was, that they were slain on both sides by the enemies, and there was no rest of their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> dying. They fell and were beaten down on the east side of the city of Gabaa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And they that were slain in the same place, were eighteen thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, all most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And when they that remained of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> saw this, they fled into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and made towards the rock that is called Remmon. In that flight also, as they were straggling, and going different ways; they slew of them five thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And as they went farther, they still pursued them, and slew also other two thousand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And so it came to pass, that all that were slain of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, in divers places, were five and twenty thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And there remained of all the number of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> only six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were able to escape, and flee to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: and they abode in the rock Remmon four months.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> returning, put all the remains of the city to the sword, both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and beasts, and all the cities and <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> were consumed with devouring flames.</span></p>
