<h1>Judges Chapter 21</h1>
<div class="h1a">The tribe of Benjamin is saved from being utterly extinct, by providing wives for the six hundred that remained.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> had also sworn in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>, saying: None of us shall give of his daughters to the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they all came to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">house of God</a> in Silo, and sitting before him till the evening, lifted up their voices, and began to lament and weep, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, why is so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> come to pass in thy people, that this day one <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> should be taken away from among us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And rising early the next day, they built an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: and offered there <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and victims of peace, and they said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Who is there among all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> that came not up with the army of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>? for they had bound themselves with a great <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, when they were in <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>, that whosoever were wanting should be slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> being moved with repentance for their brother <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, began to say: One <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> is taken away from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Whence shall they take wives? For we have all in general sworn, not to give our daughters to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Therefore they said: Who is there of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, that came not up to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> to <a href="../cathen/09788a.htm">Maspha</a>? And, behold, the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad were found not to have been in that army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> (At that time also when they were in Silo, no one of them was found there),</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So they sent ten thousand of the most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and commanded them, saying: Go and put the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad to the sword, with their wives and their children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And this is what you shall observe: Every male, and all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that have known <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, you shall kill, but the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> you shall save.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And there were found of Jabes Galaad four hundred <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, that had not known the bed of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and they brought them to the camp in Silo, into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they sent messengers to the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a>, that were in the rock Remmon, and commanded them to receive them in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> came at that time, and wives were given them of Jabes Galaad: but they found no others, whom they might give in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was very sorry, and repented for the destroying of one <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the ancients said: What shall we do with the rest, that have not received wives? for all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> are dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And we must use all care, and provide with great diligence, that one <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a> be not destroyed out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For as to our own daughters we cannot give them, being bound with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a>, whereby we said: <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">Cursed</a> be he that shall give <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a> any of his daughters to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> So they took counsel, and said: Behold, there is a yearly solemnity of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in Silo, which is situate on the north of the city of <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, and on the east side of the way, that goeth from <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a> to <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, and on the south of the town of Lebona.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they commanded the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> and said: Go, and lie hid in the vineyards,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when you shall see the daughters of Silo come out, as the custom is, to <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dance</a>, come ye on a sudden out of the vineyards, and catch you every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his wife among them, and go into the land of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when their fathers and their brethren shall come, and shall begin to complain against you, and to chide, we will say to them: Have pity on them: for they took them not away as by the right of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> or conquest, but when they asked to have them, you gave them not, and the fault was committed on your part.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">children of Benjamin</a> did as they had been commanded: and, according to their number, they carried off for themselves every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> his wife of them that were <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dancing</a>: and they went into their possession, and built up their cities, and dwelt in them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> also returned by their <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, to their dwellings. In those days there was no king in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: but every one did that which seemed right to himself.</span></p>
