<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> That afterwards their children might learn to fight with their enemies, and to be trained up to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The five princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidonians</a>, and the Hevites that dwelt in Mount Libanus, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entering into Emath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he left them, that he might try <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by them, whether they would hear the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he had commanded their fathers, by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> dwelt in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they took their daughters <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">to wives</a>, and they gave their own daughters to their sons, and they <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">served their gods</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and they forgot their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and served <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a> and Astaroth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, delivered them into the hands of Chusan Rasathaim, king of Mesopotamia, and they served him eight years. <span class="stiki"><strong>Mesopotamia...</strong> In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Aramnaharim</em>. <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> of the two rivers: so called because it lies between the Euphrates and the Tigris.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who raised them up a saviour, and delivered them; to wit, Othoniel, the son of Cenez, the younger brother of <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a> was in him, and he judged <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he went out to fight, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered Chusan Rasathaim, king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and he overthrew him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the land rested forty years, and Othoniel, the son of Cenez, died.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> again in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: who strengthened against them Eglon, king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: because they did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he joined to him the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>: and he went and overthrew <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and possessed the <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">city of palm trees</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> served Eglon, king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, eighteen years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And afterwards they cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who raised them up a saviour, called Aod, the son of Cera, the son of Jemini, who used the left hand as well as the right. And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> sent presents to Eglon, king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, by him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he made himself a two-edged sword, with a haft in the midst of the length of the palm of the hand, and was girded therewith, under his garment, on the right thigh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he presented the gifts to Eglon, king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>. Now Eglon was exceeding fat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when he had presented the gifts unto him he followed his companions that came along with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then returning from Galgal, where the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were, he said to the king: I have a secret message to thee, O king. And he commanded silence: and all being gone out that were about him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Aod went in to him: now he was sitting in a summer parlour alone, and he said: I have a word from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to thee. And he forthwith rose up from his throne. <span class="stiki"><strong>A word from God, etc...</strong> What Aod, who was judge and chief magistrate of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, did on this occasion, was by a special <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">inspiration</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but such things are not to be imitated by private <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Aod put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> With such force that the haft went in after the blade into the wound, and was closed up with the abundance of fat. So that he did not draw out the dagger, but left it in the body as he had struck it in: and forthwith, by the secret parts of nature, the excrements of the belly came out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Aod carefully shutting the doors of the parlour, and locking them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Went out by a postern door. And the king's servants going in, saw the doors of the parlour shut, and they said: Perhaps he is easing nature in his summer parlour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And waiting a long time, till they were ashamed, and seeing that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> opened the door, they took a key: and opening, they found their lord lying dead on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But Aod, while they were in confusion, escaped, and passed by the place of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> from whence he had returned. And he came to Seirath:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And forthwith he sounded the trumpet in Mount Ephraim: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> went down with him, he himself going in the front.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he said to them: Follow me: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered our enemies, the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>, into our hands. And they went down after him, and seized upon the fords of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, which are in the way to <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: and they suffered no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to pass over:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But they slew of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> at that time, about ten thousand, all strong and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: none of them could escape.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> that day under the hand of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and the land rested eighty years.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> After him was Samgar, the son of Anath, who slew of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> six hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with a ploughshare: and he also defended <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
