<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> again did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> after the death of Aod:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> delivered them up into the hands of Jabin, king of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, who reigned in Asor: and he had a general of his army <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Sisara, and he dwelt in Haroseth of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for he had nine hundred chariots set with scythes and for twenty years had grievously oppressed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And there was at that time <a href="../cathen/04663a.htm">Debbora</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a>, the wife of Lapidoth, who judged the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And she sat under a palm tree, which was called by her <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, between Rama and <a href="../cathen/02532d.htm">Bethel</a>, in Mount Ephraim: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> came up to her for all judgment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And she sent and called <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac, the Son of Abinoem</a>, out of <a href="../cathen/03475b.htm">Cedes</a>, in <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthali</a>: and she said to him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath commanded thee: Go, and lead an army to <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Thabor</a>, and thou shalt take with thee ten thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">children of Nephthali</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">children of Zabulon</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I will bring unto thee in the place of the torrent Cison, Sisara, the general of Jabin's army, and his chariots, and all his multitude, and will deliver them into thy hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a> said to her: If thou wilt come with me, I will go: if thou wilt not come with me, I will not go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> She said to him: I will go, indeed, with thee, but at this time the victory shall not be attributed to thee, because Sisara shall be delivered into the hand of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. <a href="../cathen/04663a.htm">Debbora</a> therefore arose, and went with <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a> to <a href="../cathen/03475b.htm">Cedes</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he called unto him <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a> and <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthali</a>, and went up with ten thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, having <a href="../cathen/04663a.htm">Debbora</a> in his company.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now Haber, the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinite</a>, had some time before departed from the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinites</a>, his brethren, the sons of Hobab, the kinsman of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: and had pitched his tents unto the valley, which is called Sennim, and was near <a href="../cathen/03475b.htm">Cedes</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it was told Sisara, that <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac, the son of Abinoem</a>, was gone up to <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Thabor</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he gathered together his nine hundred chariots armed with scythes, and all his army, from Haroseth of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to the torrent Cison.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/04663a.htm">Debbora</a> said to <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a>: Arise, for this is the day wherein the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered Sisara into thy hands: behold, he is thy leader. And <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a> went down from <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mount Thabor</a>, and ten thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> struck a terror into Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his multitude, with the edge of the sword, at the sight of <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a>; insomuch, that Sisara leaping down from off his chariot, fled away on foot,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a> pursued after the fleeing chariots, and the army, unto Haroseth of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and all the multitude of the enemies was utterly destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But Sisara fleeing, came to the tent of Jahel, the wife of Haber, the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinite</a>, for there was peace between Jabin, the king of Asor, and the house of Haber, the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinite</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Jahel went forth to meet Sisara, and said to him: Come in to me, my lord; come in, fear not. He went into her tent, and being covered by her with a cloak,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Said to her: Give me, I beseech thee, a little water, for I am very thirsty. She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Sisara said to her: Stand before the door of the tent, and when any shall come and inquire of thee, saying: Is there any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> here? thou shalt say: There is none.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> So Jahel, Haber's wife, took a nail of the tent, and taking also a hammer: and going in softly, and with silence, she put the nail upon the temples of his head, and striking it with the hammer, drove it through his brain fast into the ground: and so passing from deep sleep to death, he fainted away and died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And behold, <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a> came pursuing after Sisara: and Jahel went out to meet him, and said to him: Come, and I will show thee the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, he saw Sisara lying dead, and the nail fastened in his temples.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> So <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that day <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> Jabin, the king of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Who grew daily stronger, and with a mighty hand overpowered Jabin, king of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, till they quite destroyed him.</span></p>
