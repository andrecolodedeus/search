<div class="h1a">The people for their sins, are oppressed by the Madianites. Gideon is called to deliver them.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> again did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and he delivered them into the hand of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> seven years,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they were grievously oppressed by them. And they made themselves dens and caves in the mountains, and strong holds to resist.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had sown, <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> and <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, and the rest of the eastern nations, came up:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And pitching their tents among them, wasted all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">things</a> as they were in the blade, even to the entrance of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>: and they left nothing at all in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for sustenance of life, nor sheep, nor oxen, nor asses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For they and all their flocks came with their tents, and like locusts filled all places, an innumerable multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and of camels, wasting whatsoever they touched.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> exceedingly in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, desiring help against the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he sent unto them a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and he spoke: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: I made you to come up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and brought you out of the house of <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And delivered you out of the hands of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, and of all the enemies that afflicted you: and I cast them out at your coming in, and gave you their land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I said: I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, fear not the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">gods</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, in whose land you dwell. And you would not hear my voice.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> came, and sat under an oak that was in Ephra, and belonged to Joas, the father of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Ezri. And when <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>, his son, was threshing and cleansing wheat by the winepress, to flee from <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> appeared to him, and said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is with thee, O most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> said to him: I beseech thee, my lord, if the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be with us, why have these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> fallen upon us? Where are his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which our fathers have told us of, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> brought us out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> but now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hand of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> looked upon him, and said: Go, in this thy strength, and thou shalt deliver <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of the hand of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>: know that I have sent thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He answered, and said: I beseech thee, my lord wherewith shall I deliver <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Behold, my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is the meanest in <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and I am the least in my father's house. <span class="stiki"><strong>The meanest in Manasses, etc...</strong> Mark how the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> chooseth the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> (who are mean and little in their own eyes) for the greatest enterprises.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: I will be with thee: and thou shalt cut off <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said: If I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before thee, give me a sign that it is thou that speakest to me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And depart not hence, till I return to thee, and bring a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and offer it to thee. And he answered: I will wait thy coming.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> So <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> went in, and boiled a kid, and made <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened loaves</a> of a measure of flour: and putting the flesh in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into a pot, he carried all under the oak, and presented to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> said to him: Take the flesh and the <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened loaves</a>, and lay them upon that rock, and pour out the broth thereon. And when he had done so,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> put forth the tip of the rod, which he held in his hand, and touched the flesh and the <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened loaves</a>: and there arose a fire from the rock, and consumed the flesh and the <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened loaves</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> vanished out of his sight.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> seeing that it was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a>, said: Alas, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: for I have seen the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> face to face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Peace be with thee: fear not, thou shalt not die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> built there an <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and called it <em>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord's</a> peace</em>, until this present day. And when he was yet in Ephra, which is of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Ezri,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> That night the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Take a bullock of thy father's, and another bullock of seven years, and thou shalt destroy the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, which is thy father's: and cut down the grove that is about the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And thou shalt build un <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, in the top of this rock, whereupon thou didst lay the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> before: and thou shalt take the second bullock, and shalt offer a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> upon a pile of the wood, which thou shalt cut down out of the grove.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Then <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>, taking ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of his servants, did as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him. But fearing his father's house, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that city, he would not do it by day, but did all by night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that town were risen in the morning, they saw the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> destroyed, and the grove cut down, and the second bullock laid upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, which then was built.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they said one to another: Who hath done this? And when they inquired for the author of the fact, it was said: <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon, the son of Joas</a>, did all this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And they said to Joas: Bring out thy son hither, that he may die: because he hath destroyed the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and hath cut down his grove.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> He answered them: Are you the avengers of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, that you fight for him? he that is his adversary, let him die before tomorrow light appear: if he be a god, let him revenge himself on him that hath cast down his <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> From that day <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> was called <em>Jerobaal</em>, because Joas had said: Let <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> revenge himself on him that hath cast down his <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Now all <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, and the eastern people, were gathered together, and passing over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, camped in the valley of Jezrael.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of the Lord</a> came upon <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>, and he sounded the trumpet, and called together the house of Abiezer, to follow him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he sent messengers into all <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, and they also followed him and other messengers into <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Aser</a> and <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthali</a>, and they came to meet him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: If thou wilt save <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by my hand, as thou hast said,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> I will put this fleece of wool on the floor: if there be dew in the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground beside, I shall know that by my hand, as thou hast said, thou wilt deliver <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And it was so. And rising before day, wringing the fleece, he filled a vessel with the dew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he said again to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: Let not thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> be kindled against me, if I try once more, seeking a sign in the fleece. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the fleece only may be dry, and all the ground wet with dew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did that night as he had requested: and it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</span></p>
