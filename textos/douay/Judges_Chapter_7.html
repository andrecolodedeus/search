<h1>Judges Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">Gideon, with three hundred men, by stratagem defeats the Madianites.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, who is the same as <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>, rising up early, and all the people with him, came to the fountain that is called Harad. Now the camp of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> was in the valley, on the north side of the high hill.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>: The people that are with thee are many, and <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> shall not be delivered into their hands: lest <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> against me, and say: I was delivered by my own strength. <span class="stiki"><strong>Lest Israel, etc...</strong> By this we see that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not choose for his instruments in great achievements, which depend purely on his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, such as, through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and self conceit, will take the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to themselves.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Speak to the people, and proclaim in the hearing of all: Whosoever is fearful and timorous, let him return. So two and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went away from Mount Galaad and returned home, and only ten thousand remained.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>: The people are still too many, bring them to the waters, and there I will try them: and of whom I shall say to thee, This shall go with thee, let him go: whom I shall forbid to go, let him return.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when the people were come down to the waters, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>: They that shall lap the water with their tongues, as dogs are wont to lap, thou shalt set apart by themselves: but they that shall drink bowing down their knees, shall be on the other side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the number of them that had lapped water; casting it with the hand to their mouth, was three hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and all the rest of the multitude had drunk kneeling.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>: By the three hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that lapped water, I will save you, and deliver <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> into thy hand: but let all the rest of the people return to their place. <span class="stiki"><strong>That lapped water...</strong> These were preferred that took the water up in their hands, and so lapped it, before them who laid themselves quite down to the waters to drink: which argued a more eager and sensual disposition.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So taking victuals and trumpets according to their number, he ordered all the rest of the multitude to depart to their tents: and he with the three hundred gave himself to the battle. Now the camp of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madia</a> was beneath him in the valley.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The same night the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Arise, and go down into the camp: because I have delivered them into thy hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But if thou be afraid to go alone, let Phara, thy servant, go down with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when thou shalt hear what they are saying, then shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou shalt go down more secure to the enemies' camp. And he went down with Phara his servant, into part of the camp, where was the watch of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in arms.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> and <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, and all the eastern people, lay scattered in the valley, as a multitude of locusts: their camels also were innumerable, as the sand that lieth on the sea shore.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> was come, one told his neighbour a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>: and in this manner related what he had seen: I dreamt a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, and it seemed to me as if a hearth cake of barley bread rolled and came down into the camp of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>: and when it was come to a tent, it struck it, and beat it down flat to the ground. <span class="stiki"><strong>A dream...</strong> <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">Observation of dreams</a> is commonly <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>, and as such is condemned in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but in some extraordinary cases, as we here see, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is pleased by <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dreams</a> to foretell what he is about to do.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He to whom he spoke, answered: This is nothing else but the sword of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon, the son of Joas</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, and all their camp into his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> had heard the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpretation</a> thereof, he <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>: and returned to the camp of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and said: Arise, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered the camp of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> into our hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he divided the three hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> into three parts, and gave them trumpets in their hands, and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said to them: What you shall see me do, do you the same: I will go into one part of the camp, and do you as I shall do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> When the trumpet shall sound in my hand, do you also blow the trumpets on every side of the camp, and shout together to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>, and the three hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, went into part of the camp, at the beginning of the midnight watch, and the watchmen being alarmed, they began to sound their trumpets, and to clap the pitchers one against another. <span class="stiki"><strong>Their trumpets, etc...</strong> In a mystical sense, the preachers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, in order to spiritual conquests, must not only sound with the trumpet of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but must also break their earthen pitchers, by the <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of the flesh and its <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and carry lamps in their hands by the light of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when they sounded their trumpets in three places round about the camp, and had broken their pitchers, they held their lamps in their left hands, and with their right hands the trumpets which they blew, and they cried out: The sword of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Standing every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his place round about the enemies' camp. So all the camp was troubled, and crying out and howling, they fled away:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the three hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> nevertheless persisted sounding the trumpets. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent the sword into all the camp, and they killed one another,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Fleeing as far as Bethsetta, and the border of <a href="../cathen/01036a.htm">Abelmahula</a>, in Tebbath. But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, shouting from <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthali</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Aser</a>, and from all <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, pursued after <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> sent messengers into all Mount Ephraim, saying: Come down to meet <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, and take the waters before them to Bethbera and the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. And all Ephraim shouted, and took the waters before them and the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> as far as Bethbera.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And having taken two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, Oreb and Zeb: Oreb they slew in the rock of Oreb, and Zeb in the winepress of Zeb. And they pursued <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, carrying the heads of Oreb and Zeb to <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>, beyond the waters of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Two men...</strong> That is, two of their chiefs.</span></span></p>
