<h1>Judges Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="h1a">Gideon appeases the Ephraimites. Takes Zebee and Salmana. Destroys Soccoth and Phanuel. Refuses to be king. Makes an ephod of the gold of the prey, and dies in a good old age. The people return to idolatry.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Ephraim said to him: What is this that thou meanest to do, that thou wouldst not call us, when thou wentest to fight against <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>? And they chid him sharply, and almost offered <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he answered them: What could I have done like to that which you have done? Is not one bunch of grapes of Ephraim better than the vintages of Abiezer? <span class="stiki"><strong>What could I, etc...</strong> A meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> answer appeased them; who otherwise might have come to extremities. So great is the power of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> both with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered into your hands the princes of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, Oreb and Zeb: what could I have done like to what you have done? And when he had said this, their spirit was appeased, with which they swelled against him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> was come to the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, he passed over it with the three hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him: who were so weary that they could not pursue after them that fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Soccoth: Give, I beseech you, bread to the people that is with me, for they are faint: that we may pursue Zebee, and Salmana, the kings of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The princes of Soccoth answered: Peradventure the palms of the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hand, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to thy army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to them: When the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> therefore shall have delivered Zebee and Salmana into my hands, I will thresh your flesh with the thorns and briers of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And going up from thence, he came to Phanuel: and he spoke the like things to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that place. And they also answered him, as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Soccoth had answered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He said, therefore, to them also: When I shall return a conqueror in peace, I will destroy this tower.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But Zebee and Salmana were resting with all their army. For fifteen thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were left of all the troops of the eastern people, and one hundred and twenty thousand warriors that drew the sword were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, on the east of Nobe and Jegbaa, and smote the camp of the enemies, who were secure, and suspected no hurt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Zebee and Salmana fled, and <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> pursued and took them, all their host being put in confusion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And returning from the battle before the sun rising,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He took a boy of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Soccoth: and he asked him the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of the princes and ancients of Soccoth, and he described unto him seventy-seven <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he came to Soccoth, and said to them: Behold Zebee, and Salmana, concerning whom you upbraided me, saying: Peradventure the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hands, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are weary and faint.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So he took the ancients of the city, and thorns and briers of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and tore them with the same, and cut in pieces the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Soccoth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he demolished the tower of Phanuel, and slew the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said to Zebee and Salmana: What manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were they, whom you slew in <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Thabor</a>? They answered: They were like thee, and one of them as the son of a king.</span>
<p class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He answered them: They were my brethren, the sons of my mother. As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, if you had saved them, I would not kill you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he said to Jether, his eldest son: Arise, and slay them. But he drew not his sword: for he was afraid, being but yet a boy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Zebee and Salmana said: Do thou rise and run upon us: because the strength of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is according to his age: <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> rose up, and slew Zebee and Salmana: and he took the ornaments and bosses, with which the necks of the camels of kings are wont to be adorned.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said to <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>: Rule thou over us, and thy son, and thy son's son: because thou hast delivered us from the hand of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he said to them: I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall rule over you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he said to them: I desire one request of you: Give me the earlets of your spoils. For the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Ismaelites</a> were accustomed to wear golden earlets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> They answered: We will give them most willingly. And spreading a mantle on the ground, they cast upon it the earlets of the spoils.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the weight of the earlets that he requested, was a thousand seven hundred sicles of gold, besides the ornaments, and jewels, and purple raiment, which the kings of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> were wont to use, and besides the golden chains that were about the camels necks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> made an <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a> thereof, and put it in his city Ephra. And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> committed <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">fornication</a> with it, and it became a ruin to <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a>, and to all his house. <span class="stiki"><strong>An ephod...</strong> A <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">priestly garment</a> which <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> made with a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> design; but the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, after his death, abused it by making it an instrument of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous worship</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, neither could they any more lift up their heads: but the land rested for forty years, while <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> presided.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal, the son of Joas</a>, went and dwelt in his own house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he had seventy sons, who came out of his thigh, for he had many wives.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>, that he had in <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, bore him a son, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Abimelech. <span class="stiki"><strong>His concubine...</strong> She was his servant, but not his harlot: and is called his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>, as wives of an inferior degree are commonly called in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, though otherwise lawfully <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon, the son of Joas</a> died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father, in Ephra, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Ezri.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But after <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Gedeon</a> was dead, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> turned again, and committed <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">fornication</a> with <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baalim</a>. And they made a covenant with <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, that he should be their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">god</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And they remembered not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies round about:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Neither did they show mercy to the house of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal Gedeon</a>, according to all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things he had done to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
