<div class="h1a">Abimelech kills his brethren. Joatham's parable. Gaal conspires with the Sichemites against Abimelech, but is overcome. Abimelech destroys Sichem: but is killed at Thebes.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Abimelech, the son of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, to his mother's brethren, and spoke to them, and to all the kindred of his mother's father, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Speak to all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>: whether is better for you that seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, all the sons of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, should rule over you, or that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should rule over you? And withal, consider that I am your bone, and your flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And his mother's brethren spoke of him to all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, all these words, and they inclined their hearts after Abimelech, saying: He is our brother:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they gave him seventy weight of silver out of the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Baalberith: wherewith he hired to himself <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were <!--<a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">-->needy<!--</a>-->, and vagabonds, and they followed him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Baalberith...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> of the covenant, so called from the covenant they had made with <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, <a href="../douay/jos008.htm#verse33">Joshua 8:33</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he came to his father's house in Ephra, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slew</a> his brethren, the sons of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, upon one stone: and there remained only Joatham, the youngest son of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, who was hidden.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a> were gathered together, and all the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the city of Mello: and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak that stood in <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> This being told to Joatham, he went, and stood on the top of Mount Garizim: and lifting up his voice, he cried, and said: Hear me, ye <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, so may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hear you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The trees went to anoint a king over them: and they said to the olive tree: Reign thou over us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And it answered: Can I leave my fatness, which both gods and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> make use of, to come to be promoted among the trees? <span class="stiki"><strong>Both gods and men make use of...</strong> The olive tree is introduced, speaking in this manner, because oil was used both in the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, and in that of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">false gods</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichemites</a> served.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the trees said to the fig tree: Come thou and reign over us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it answered them: Can I leave my sweetness, and my delicious fruits, and go to be promoted among the other trees?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the trees said to the vine: Come thou and reign over us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And it answered them: Can I forsake my wine, that cheereth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and be promoted among the other trees? <span class="stiki"><strong>Cheereth God and men...</strong> Wine is here represented as agreeable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because he had appointed it to be offered up with his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. But we are not obliged to take these words, spoken by the trees, in Joatham's <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, according to the strict literal sense: but only in a sense accommodated to the design of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> expressed in the conclusion of it.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And all the trees said to the bramble: Come thou and reign over us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it answered them: If, indeed, you mean to make me king, come ye, and rest under my shadow: but if you mean it not, let fire come out from the bramble, and devour the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a> of Libanus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Now, therefore, if you have done well, and without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in appointing Abimelech king over you, and have dealt well with <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, and with his house, and have made a suitable return for the benefits of him who fought for you,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And exposed his life to dangers, to deliver you from the hand of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And you are now risen up against my father's house, and have <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> his sons, seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his handmaid, king over the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, because he is your brother:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> If therefore you have dealt well, and without fault, with <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a> and his house, rejoice ye, this day, in Abimelech, and may he rejoice in you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But if <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>: let fire come out from him, and consume the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, and the town of Mello: and let fire come out from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a> and from the town of Mello, and devour Abimelech.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when he had said thus, he fled, and went into Bera: and dwelt there for fear of Abimelech, his brother.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So Abimelech reigned over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> three years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent a very <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> between Abimelech and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>; who began to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">detest</a> him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And to lay the crime of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">murder</a> of the seventy sons of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, and the shedding of their blood, upon Abimelech, their brother, and upon the rest of the princes of the <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichemites</a>, who <a href="../cathen/01100a.htm">aided</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they set an ambush against him on the top of the mountains: and while they waited for his coming, they committed <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robberies</a>, taking spoils of all that passed by: and it was told Abimelech.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And Gaal, the son of Obed, came with his brethren, and went over to <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>. And the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, taking <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> at his coming,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Went out into the fields, wasting the vineyards, and treading down the grapes: and singing and <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dancing</a>, they went into the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of their god, and in their banquets and cups they <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> Abimelech.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And Gaal, the son of Obed, cried: Who is Abimelech, and what is <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, and hath made Zebul, his servant, ruler over the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Emor, the father of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>? Why then shall we serve him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would put this people under my hand, that I might remove Abimelech out of the way. And it was said to Abimelech: Gather together the multitude of an army, and come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For Zebul, the ruler of the city, hearing the words of Gaal, the son of Obed, was very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And sent messengers privately to Abimelech, saying: Behold, Gaal, the son of Obed, is come into <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a> with his brethren, and endeavoureth to set the city against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Arise, therefore, in the night, with the people that is with thee, and lie hid in the field:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And betimes in the morning, at sun rising, set upon the city, and when he shall come out against thee, with his people, do to him what thou shalt be able.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Abimelech, therefore, arose with all his army, by night, and laid ambushes near <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a> in four places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And Gaal, the son of Obed, went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. And Abimelech rose up, and all his army with him, from the places of the ambushes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: Behold, a multitude cometh down from the mountains. And he answered him: Thou seest the shadows of the mountains as if they were the heads of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and this is thy mistake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Again Gaal said: Behold, there cometh people down from the midst of the land, and one troop cometh by the way that looketh towards the oak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And Zebul said to him: Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst: Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? Is not this the people which thou didst <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a>? Go out, and fight against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> So Gaal went out, in the sight of the people of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, and fought against Abimelech,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Who chased and put him to flight, and drove him to the city: and many were slain of his people, even to the gate of the city:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And Abimelech sat down in Ruma: but Zebul drove Gaal, and his companions, out of the city, and would not suffer them to abide in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> So the day following the people went out into the field. And it was told to Abimelech,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And he took his army, and divided it into three companies, and laid ambushes in the fields. And seeing that the people came out of the city, he arose, and set upon them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> With his own company, assaulting and besieging the city: whilst the two other companies chased the enemies that were scattered about the field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And Abimelech assaulted the city all that day: and took it, and killed the inhabitants thereof, and demolished it, so that he sowed <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> in it. <span class="stiki"><strong>Sowed salt...</strong> To make the ground barren, and fit for nothing.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And when they who dwelt in the tower of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>, had heard this, they went into the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of their god Berith, where they had made a covenant with him, and from thence the place had taken its <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and it was exceeding strong.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Abimelech also hearing that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the tower of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a> were gathered together,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Went up into mount Selmon, he and all his people with him: and taking an axe, he cut down the bough of a tree, and laying it on his shoulder, and carrying it, he said to his companions: What you see me do, do ye out of hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> So they cut down boughs from the trees, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as fast as he could, and followed their leader. And surrounding the fort, they set it on fire: and so it came to pass, that with the smoke and with the fire a thousand persons were killed, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> together, of the inhabitants of the town of <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Then Abimelech, departing from thence, came to the town of Thebes, which he surrounded and besieged with his army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And there was in the midst of the city a high tower, to which both the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were fled together, and all the princes of the city, and having shut and strongly barred the gate, they stood upon the battlements of the tower to defend themselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And Abimelech, coming near the tower, fought stoutly: and, approaching to the gate, endeavoured to set fire to it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And behold, a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> casting a piece of a millstone from above, dashed it against the head of Abimelech, and broke his skull.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And he called hastily to his armourbearer, and said to him: Draw thy sword, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> me: lest it should be said that I was slain by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. He did as he was commanded, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slew</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And when he was dead all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that were with him, returned to their homes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> repaid the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that Abimelech had done against his father, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killing</a> his seventy brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> The <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichemites</a> also were rewarded for what they had done, and the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> of Joatham, the son of <a href="../cathen/06402c.htm">Jerobaal</a>, came upon them.</span></p>
