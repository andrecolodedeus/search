<h1>Judith Chapter 10</h1>
<div class="h1a">Judith goes out towards the camp, and is taken, and brought to Holofernes.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, when she had ceased to cry to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that she rose from the place wherein she lay prostrate before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And she called her maid, and going down into her house she took off her haircloth, and put away the garments of her widowhood,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And she washed her body, and anointed herself with the best <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>, and plaited the hair of her head, and put a bonnet upon her head, and clothed herself with the garments of her gladness, and put sandals on her feet, and took her bracelets, and lilies, and earlets, and rings, and adorned herself with all her ornaments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also gave her more beauty: because all this dressing up did not proceed from sensuality, but from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and therefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> increased this her beauty, so that she appeared to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> eyes incomparably lovely.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And she gave to her maid a bottle of wine to carry, and a vessel of oil, and parched corn, and dry figs, and bread and cheese, and went out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when they came to the gate of the city, they found <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a>, and the ancients of the city waiting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when they saw her they were astonished, and admired her beauty exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But they asked her no question, only they let her pass, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers give thee <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and may he strengthen all the counsel of thy heart with his power, that <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in thee, and thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> may be in the number of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they that were there said, all with one voice: So be it, so be it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But Judith <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, passed through the gates, she and her maid.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it came to pass, when she went down the hill, about break of day, that the watchmen of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> met her, and stopped her, saying: Whence comest thou or whither goest thou?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And she answered: I am a daughter of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">Hebrews</a>, and I am fled from them, because I knew they would be made a prey to you, because they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> you, and would not of their own accord yield themselves, that they might find mercy in your sight. <span class="stiki"><strong>Because I knew, etc...</strong> In this and the following chapter, some things are related to have been said by Judith, which seem hard to reconcile with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But all that is related in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not approved by the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>; and even the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> enterprises may sometimes slip into venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For this reason I thought with myself, saying: I will go to the presence of the prince Holofernes, that I may tell him their secrets, and show him by what way he may take them, without the loss of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of his army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> had heard her words, they beheld her face, and their eyes were amazed, for they wondered exceedingly at her beauty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they said to her: Thou hast saved thy life by taking this resolution, to come down to our lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And be assured of this, that when thou shalt stand before him, he will treat thee well, and thou wilt be most acceptable to his heart. And they brought her to the tent of Holofernes, telling him of her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when she was come into his presence, forthwith Holofernes was caught by his eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And his officers said to him: Who can <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> the people of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">Hebrews</a>, who have such beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that we should not think it worth our while for their sakes to fight against them?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Judith seeing Holofernes sitting under a canopy, which was woven of purple and gold, with emeralds and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> After she had looked on his face, bowed down to him, prostrating herself to the ground. And the servants of Holofernes lifted her up, by the command of their master.</span></p>
