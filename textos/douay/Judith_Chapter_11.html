<h1>Judith Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">Judith's speech to Holofernes.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Holofernes said to her: Be of good comfort, and fear not in thy heart: for I have never hurt a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was willing to serve <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor the king</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And if thy people had not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> me, I would never have lifted up my spear against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But now tell me, for what cause hast thou left them, and why it hath pleased thee to come to us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Judith said to him: Receive the words of thy handmaid, for if thou wilt follow the words of thy handmaid, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will do with thee a perfect thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For as <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor the king of the earth</a> liveth, and his power liveth which is in thee for chastising of all straying <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: not only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> serve him through thee, but also the beasts of the field <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For the industry of thy mind is spoken of among all nations, and it is told through the whole world, that thou only art excellent, and mighty in all his kingdom, and thy discipline is cried up in all provinces.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> It is known also what Achior said, nor are we <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what thou hast commanded to be done to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For it is certain that our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is so offended with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that he hath sent word by his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to the people, that he will deliver them up for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And because the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> know they have offended their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thy dread is upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Moreover also a famine hath come upon them, and for drought of water they are already to be counted among the dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they have a design even to kill their cattle, and to drink the blood of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> things of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbade them to touch, in corn, wine, and oil, these have they purposed to make use of, and they design to consume the things which they ought not to touch with their hands: therefore because they do these things, it is certain they will be given up to destruction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I thy handmaid knowing this, am fled from them, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath sent me to tell thee these very things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For I thy handmaid worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even now that I am with thee, and thy handmaid will go out, and I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he will tell me when he will repay them for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and I will come and tell thee, so that I may bring thee through the midst of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and thou shalt have all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as sheep that have no shepherd, and there shall not so much as one dog bark against thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Because these things are told me by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them, I am sent to tell these very things to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And all these words pleased Holofernes, and his servants, and they admired her wisdom, and they said one to another:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> There is not such another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> upon earth in look, in beauty, and in sense of words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Holofernes said to her: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath done well who sent thee before the people, that thou mightest give them into our hands:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And because thy promise is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall do this for me, he shall also be my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thou shalt be great in the house of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, and thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> shall be renowned through all the earth.</span></p>
