<h1>Judith Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">Judith goes out in the night to pray: she is invited to a banquet with Holofernes.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then he ordered that she should go in where his treasures were laid up, and bade her tarry there, and he appointed what should be given her from his own table.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Judith answered him and said: Now I cannot eat of these things which thou commandest to be given me, lest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> come upon me: but I will eat of the things which I have brought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Holofernes said to her: If these things which thou hast brought with thee fail thee, what shall we do for thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Judith said: As thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> liveth, my lord, thy handmaid shall not spend all these things till <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do by my hand that which I have purposed. And his servants brought her into the tent which he had commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when she was going in, she desired that she might have liberty to go out at night and before day to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and to beseech the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he commanded his chamberlains, that she might go out and in, to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> her <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as she pleased, for three days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And she went out in the nights into the valley of <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, and washed herself in a fountain of water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And as she came up, she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that he would direct her way to the deliverance of his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And going in, she remained pure in the tent, until she took her own meat in the evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And it came to pass on the fourth day, that Holofernes made a supper for his servants, and said to Vagao his eunuch: Go, and persuade that <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, to consent of her own accord to dwell with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For it is looked upon as shameful among the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> mock a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by doing so as to pass free from him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then Vagao went in to Judith, and said: Let not my <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> maid be afraid to go in to my lord, that she may be honoured before his face, that she may eat with him and drink wine and be merry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Judith answered him: Who am I, that I should gainsay my lord?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> All that shall be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and best before his eyes, I will do. And whatsoever shall please him, that shall be best to me all the days of my life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And she arose and dressed herself out with her garments, and going in she stood before his face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the heart of Holofernes was smitten, for he was burning with the desire of her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Holofernes said to her: Drink now, and sit down and be merry; for thou hast found favour before me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Judith said: I will drink my lord, because my life is magnified this day above all my days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared for her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Holofernes was made merry on her occasion, and drank exceeding much wine, so much as he had never drunk in his life.</span></p>
