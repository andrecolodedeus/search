<h1>Judith Chapter 13</h1>
<div class="h1a">Judith cuts off the head of Holofernes, and returns to Bethulia.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when it was grown late, his servants made haste to their lodgings, and Vagao shut the chamber doors, and went his way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they were all overcharged with wine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Judith was alone in the chamber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But Holofernes lay on his bed, fast asleep, being exceedingly drunk.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Judith spoke to her maid to stand without before the chamber, and to watch:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Judith stood before the bed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> with tears, and the motion of her lips in silence,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Saying: Strengthen me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and in this hour look on the works of my hands, that as thou hast <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>, thou mayst raise up <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> thy city: and that I may bring to pass that which I have purposed, having a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that it might be done by thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when she had said this, she went to the pillar that was at his bed's head, and loosed his sword that hung tied upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when she had drawn it out, she took him by the hair of his head, and said: Strengthen me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, at this hour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And she struck twice upon his neck, and cut off his head, and took off his canopy from the pillars, and rolled away his headless body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And after a while she went out, and delivered the head of Holofernes to her maid, and bade her put it into her wallet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they two went out according to their custom, as it were to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and they passed the camp, and having compassed the valley, they came to the gate of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And Judith from afar off cried to the watchmen upon the walls: Open the gates for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is with us, who hath shown his power in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And it came to pass, when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> had heard her voice, that they called the ancients of the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And all ran to meet her from the least to the greatest: for they now had no hopes that she would come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And lighting up lights they all gathered round about her: and she went up to a higher place, and commanded silence to be made. And when all had held their peace,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Judith said: Praise ye the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>, who hath not forsaken them that hope in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And by me his handmaid he hath fulfilled his mercy, which he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>: and he hath killed the enemy of his people by my hand this night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then she brought forth the head of Holofernes out of the wallet, and showed it them, saying: Behold the head of Holofernes the general of the army of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and behold his canopy, wherein he lay in his drunkenness, where the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> slew him by the hand of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But as the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth, his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> hath been my keeper both going hence, and abiding there, and returning from thence hither: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath not suffered me his handmaid to be defiled, but hath brought me back to you without pollution of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, rejoicing for his victory, for my escape, and for your deliverance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Give all of you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to him, because he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, because his mercy endureth for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they all <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said to her: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> thee by his power, because by thee he hath brought our enemies to nought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> the prince of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, said to her: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> art thou, O daughter, by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, above all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> who made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, who hath directed thee to the cutting off the head of the prince of our enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Because he hath so magnified thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> this day, that thy praise shall not depart out of the mouth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who shall be mindful of the power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for ever, for that thou hast not spared thy life, by reason of the distress and tribulation of thy people, but hast prevented our ruin in the presence of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And all the people said: So be it, so be it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And Achior being called for came, and Judith said to him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to whom thou gavest testimony, that he revengeth himself of his enemies, he hath cut off the head of all the unbelievers this night by my hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And that thou mayst find that it is so, behold the head of Holofernes, who in the contempt of his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and threatened them with death, saying: When the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be taken, I will command thy sides to be pierced with a sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then Achior seeing the head of Holofernes, being seized with a great fear he fell on his face upon the earth, and his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> swooned away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But after he had recovered his spirits he fell down at her feet, and reverenced her, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> art thou by thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in every tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, for in every nation which shall hear thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be magnified on occasion of thee.</span></p>
