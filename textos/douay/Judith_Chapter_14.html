<h1>Judith Chapter 14</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Israelites assault the Assyrians, who finding their general slain, are seized with a panic fear.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Judith said to all the people: Hear me, my brethren, hang ye up this head upon our walls.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And as soon as the sun shall rise, let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> take his arms, and rush ye out, not as going down beneath, but as making an assault.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then the watchmen must needs run to awake their prince for the battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of them shall run to the tent of Holofernes, and shall find him without his head wallowing in his blood, fear shall fall upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when you shall know that they are fleeing, go after them securely, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will destroy them under your feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then Achior seeing the power that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had wrought, leaving the religion of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, with all the succession of his kindred until this present day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And immediately at break of day, they hung up the head of Holofernes upon the walls, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> took his arms, and they went out with a great noise and shouting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the watchmen seeing this, ran to the tent of Holofernes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they that were in the tent came, and made a noise, before the door of the chamber to awake him, endeavouring by art to break his rest, that Holofernes might awake, not by their calling him, but by their noise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> durst knock, or open and go into the chamber of the general of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But when his <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> and tribunes were come, and all the chiefs of the army of the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, they said to the chamberlains:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Go in, and awake him, for the mice, coming out of their holes, have presumed to challenge us to fight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then Vagao going into his chamber, stood before the curtain, and made a clapping with his hands: for he thought that he was sleeping with Judith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But when with hearkening, he perceived no motion of one lying, he came near to the curtain, and lifting it up, and seeing the body of Holofernes, lying upon the ground, without the head, weltering in his blood, he cried out with a loud voice, with weeping, and rent his garments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he went into the tent of Judith, and not finding her, he ran out to the people,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And said: One <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">Hebrew</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> hath made confusion in the house of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>: for behold Holofernes lieth upon the ground, and his head is not upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now when the chiefs of the army of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> had heard this, they all rent their garments, and an intolerable fear and dread fell upon them, and their minds were troubled exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And there was a very great cry in the midst of their camp.</span></p>
