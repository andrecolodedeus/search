<h1>Judith Chapter 15</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Assyrians flee: the Hebrews pursue after them, and are enriched by their spoils.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when all the army heard that Holofernes was beheaded, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and counsel fled from them, and being seized with trembling and fear they thought only to save themselves by flight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> So that no one spoke to his neighbour, but hanging down the head, leaving all things behind, they made haste to escape from the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">Hebrews</a>, who, as they heard, were coming armed upon them, and fled by the ways of the fields, and the paths of the hills.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> So the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> seeing them fleeing, followed after them. And they went down sounding with trumpets and shouting after them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And because the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> were not united together, they went without order in their flight; but the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> pursuing in one body, defeated all that they could find.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> sent messengers through all the cities and countries of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And every country, and every city, sent their chosen young men armed after them, and they pursued them with the edge of the sword until they came to the extremities of their confines.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the rest that were in <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a> went into the camp of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and took away the spoils which the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> in their flight had left behind them, and they were laden exceedingly,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But they that returned conquerors to <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, brought with them all things that were theirs, so that there was no numbering of their cattle, and beasts, and all their moveables, insomuch that from the least to the greatest all were made rich by their spoils.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Joachim the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> came from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a> with all his ancients to see Judith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when she was come out to him, they all <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> her with one voice, saying: Thou art the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, thou art the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, thou art the honour of our people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For thou hast done manfully, and thy heart has been strengthened, because thou hast <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> chastity, and after thy husband hast not known any other: therefore also the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath strengthened thee, and therefore thou shalt be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> for ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And all the people said: So be it, so be it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And thirty days were scarce sufficient for the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to gather up the spoils of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But all those things that were proved to be the peculiar goods of Holofernes, they gave to Judith in gold, and silver, and garments and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>, and all household stuff, and they all were delivered to her by the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And all the people rejoiced, with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and virgins, and young men, playing on instruments and harps.</span></p>
