<h1>Judith Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">The canticle of Judith: her virtuous life and death.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Judith sung this canticle to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Begin ye to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with timbrels, sing ye to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with cymbals, tune unto him a new psalm, extol and call upon his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> putteth an end to wars, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He hath set his camp in the midst of his people, to deliver us from the hand of all our enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> came out of the mountains from the north in the multitude of his strength: his multitude stopped up the torrents, and their horses covered the valleys.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He bragged that he would set my borders on fire, and kill my young men with the sword, to make my infants a prey, and my virgins captives.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But the almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the hands of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and hath slain him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For their mighty one did not fall by young men, neither did the sons of Titan strike him, nor tall giants oppose themselves to him, but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her face.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For she put off her the garments of widowhood, and put on her the garments of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, to give <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> She anointed her face with <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>, and bound up her locks with a crown, she took a new robe to deceive him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty made his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> her captive, with a sword she cut off his head.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The Persians quaked at her constancy, and the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> at her boldness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then the camp of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> howled, when my lowly ones appeared, parched with thirst.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and they have killed them like children fleeing away: they perished in battle before the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Let us sing a hymn to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, let us sing a new hymn to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> O <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, great art thou, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in thy power, and no one can overcome thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Let all thy creatures serve thee: because thou hast spoken, and they were made: thou didst send forth thy spirit, and they were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, and there is no one that can resist thy voice.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The mountains shall be moved from the foundations with the waters: the rocks shall melt as wax before thy face.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But they that fear thee, shall be great with thee in all things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Woe be to the nation that riseth up against my people: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord almighty</a> will take revenge on them, in the day of judgment he will visit them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For he will give fire, and worms into their flesh, that they may burn, and may feel for ever.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And it came to pass after these things, that all the people, after the victory, came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and as soon as they were purified, they all offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and their promises.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Judith offered for an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> of oblivion all the arms of Holofernes, which the people gave her, and the canopy that she had taken away out of his chamber. <span class="stiki"><strong>An anathema of oblivion...</strong> That is, a gift or <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by way of an everlasting monument, to prevent the oblivion or forgetting so great a benefit.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the people were joyful in the sight of the sanctuary, and for three months the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of this victory was celebrated with Judith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And after those days every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> returned to his house, and Judith was made great in <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, and she was most renowned in all the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And chastity was joined to her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that she knew no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> all the days of her life, after the death of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a> her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And on festival days she came forth with great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And she abode in her husband's house a hundred and five years, and made her handmaid free, and she died, and was buried with her husband in <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And all the people mourned for seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And all the time of her life there was none that troubled <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, nor many years after her death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But the day of the festivity of this victory is received by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a> in the number of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> days, and is religiously observed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from that time until this day.</span></p>
