<h1>Judith Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Nebuchadnezzer sends Holofernes to destroy the countries of the west.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the thirteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, the two and twentieth day of the first month, the word was given out in the house of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians</a>, that he would revenge himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he called all the ancients, and all the governors, and his officers of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and communicated to them the secret of his counsel:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said that his thoughts were to bring all the earth under his empire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when this saying pleased them all, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, the king, called Holofernes the general of his armies,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And said to him: Go out against all the kingdoms of the west, and against them especially that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> my commandment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thy eye shall not spare any kingdom, and all the strong cities thou shalt bring under my yoke.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then Holofernes called the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a>, and officers of the power of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>: and he mustered <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for the expedition, and the king commanded him, a hundred and twenty thousand fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> on foot, and twelve thousand archers, horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he made all his warlike preparations to go before with a multitude of innumerable camels, with all provisions sufficient for the armies in abundance, and herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep, without number.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He appointed corn to be prepared out of all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> in his passage.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But gold and silver he took out of the king's house in great abundance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he went forth he and all the army, with the chariots, and horsemen, and archers, who covered the face of the earth, like locusts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when he had passed through the borders of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, he came to the great mountains of Ange, which are on the left of Cilicia: and he went up to all their castles, and took all the strong places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he took by assault the renowned city of Melothus, and pillaged all the children of Tharsis, and the children of Ismahel, who were over against the face of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and on the south of the land of Cellon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he passed over the Euphrates and came into Mesopotamia: and he forced all the stately cities that were there, from the torrent of Mambre, till one comes to the sea:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he took the borders thereof, from Cilicia to the coasts of Japheth, which are towards the south.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he carried away all the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">children of Madian</a>, and stripped them of all their riches, and all that resisted him he slew with the edge of the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And after these things he went down into the plains of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> in the days of the harvest, and he set all the corn on fire, and he caused all the trees and vineyards to be cut down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the fear of them fell upon all the inhabitants of the land.</span></p>
