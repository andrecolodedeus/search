<div class="h1a">Many submit themselves to Holofernes. He destroys their cities, and their gods, that Nebuchadnezzer only might be called God.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then the kings and the princes of all the cities and provinces, of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> Sobal, and Libya, and Cilicia sent their ambassadors, who coming to Holofernes, said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Let thy indignation towards us cease, for it is better for us to live and serve <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor the great king</a>, and be subject to thee, than to die and to perish, or suffer the miseries of slavery.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> All our cities and our <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>, all mountains and hills, and fields, and herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep, and goats, and horses, and camels, and all our goods, and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> are in thy sight:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Let all we have be subject to thy law,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Both we and our children are thy servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Come to us a peaceable lord, and use our service as it shall please thee,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then he came down from the mountains with horsemen, in great power, and made himself master of every city, and all the inhabitants of the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And from all the cities he took auxiliaries <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and chosen for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And so great a fear lay upon all those provinces, that the inhabitants of all the cities, both princes and nobles, as well as the people, went out to meet him at his coming.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And received him with garlands, and lights, and <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dances</a>, and timbrels, and flutes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And though they did these things, they could not for all that mitigate the fierceness of his heart:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For he both destroyed their cities, and cut down their groves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor the king</a> had commanded him to destroy all the gods of the earth, that he only might be called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by those nations which could be brought under him by the power of Holofernes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when he had passed through all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> Sobal, and all Apamea, and all Mesopotamia, he came to the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumeans</a> into the land of Gabaa,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he took possession of their cities, and stayed there for thirty days, in which days he commanded all the troops of his army to be united.</span></p>
