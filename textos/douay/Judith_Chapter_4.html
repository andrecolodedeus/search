<div class="h1a">The children of Israel prepare themselves to resist Holofernes. They cry to the Lord for help.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, who dwelt in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, hearing these things, were exceedingly afraid of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Dread and horror seized upon their minds, lest he should do the same to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, that he had done to other cities and their temples.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they sent into all <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> round about, as far as <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, and seized upon all the tops of the mountains:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they compassed their towns with walls and gathered together corn for provision for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Eliachim the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> wrote to all that were over against Esdrelon, which faceth the great plain near Dothain, and to all by whom there might be a passage of way, that they should take possession of the ascents of the mountains, by which there might be any way to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and should keep watch where the way was narrow between the mountains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> did as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> Eliachim had appointed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And all the people cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with great earnestness, and they <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in fastings, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, both they and their wives.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> put on haircloths, and they caused the little children to lie prostrate before the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> they covered with haircloth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with one accord, that their children might not be made a prey, and their wives carried off, and their cities destroyed, and their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things profaned, and that they might not be made a reproach to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then Eliachim the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> went about all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and spoke to them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Saying: Know ye that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will hear your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, if you continue with perseverance in fastings and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Remember <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> overcame <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a> that trusted in his own strength, and in his power, and in his army, and in his shields, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen, not by fighting with the sword, but by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So all the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> be, if you persevere in this work which you have begun.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So they being moved by this exhortation of his, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and continued in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So that even they who offered the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, offered the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> girded with haircloths, and with ashes upon their head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they all begged of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with all their heart, that he would visit his people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
