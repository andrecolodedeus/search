<h1>Judith Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">Achior gives Holofernes an account of the people of Israel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it was told Holofernes the general of the army of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> prepared themselves to resist, and had shut up the ways of the mountains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he was transported with exceeding great fury and indignation, and he called all the princes of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> and the leaders of <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said to them: Tell me what is this people that besetteth the mountains: or what are their cities, and of what sort, and how great: also what is their power, or what is their multitude: or who is the king over their <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And why they above all that dwell in the east, have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> us, and have not come out to meet us, that they might receive us with peace?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then Achior <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> answering, said; If thou vouchsafe, my lord, to hear, I will tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in thy sight concerning this people, that dwelleth in the mountains, and there shall not a false word come out of my mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> This people is of the offspring of the Chaldeans.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They dwelt first in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers, who were in the land of the Chaldeans.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Wherefore forsaking the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of their fathers, which consisted in the worship of many gods,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> They worshipped one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, who also commanded them to depart from thence, and to dwell in Charan. And when there was a famine over all the land, they went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and there for four hundred years were so multiplied, that the army of them could not be numbered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> oppressed them, and made slaves of them to labour in clay and brick, in the building of his cities, they cried to their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he struck the whole land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with divers plagues.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> had cast them out from them, and the plague had ceased from them, and they had a mind to take them again, and bring them back to their service,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> opened the sea to them in their flight, so that the waters were made to stand firm as a wall on either side, and they walked through the bottom of the sea and passed it dry foot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when an innumerable army of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> pursued after them in that place, they were so overwhelmed with the waters, that there was not one left, to tell what had happened to posterity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> After they came out of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, they abode in the deserts of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount Sina</a>, in which never <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could dwell, or <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> rested.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> There bitter fountains were made sweet for them to drink, and for forty years they received food from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Wheresoever they went in without bow and arrow, and without shield and sword, their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fought for them and overcame.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And there was no one that triumphed over this people, but when they departed from the worship of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But as often as beside their own <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they worshipped any other, they were given to spoil and to the sword, and to reproach.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And as often as they were penitent for having revolted from the worship of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> gave them power to resist.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So they overthrew the king of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, and of the Jebusites, and of the Pherezites, and of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethites</a>, and of the Hevites, and of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, and all the mighty ones in <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and they possessed their lands, and their cities:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And as long as they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not in the sight of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it was well with them: for their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateth</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And even some years ago when they had revolted from the way which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had given them to walk therein, they were destroyed in battles by many nations and very many of them were led away captive into a strange land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But of late returning to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the different places wherein they were <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">scattered</a>, they are come together and are gone up into all these mountains, and possess <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> again, where their holies are.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now therefore, my lord, search if there be any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of theirs in the sight of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: let us go up to them, because their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will surely deliver them to thee, and they shall be brought under the yoke of thy power:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But if there be no offence of this people in the sight of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we cannot resist them because their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will defend them: and we shall be a reproach to the whole earth.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And it came to pass, when Achior had ceased to speak these words, all the great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Holofernes were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and they had a mind to kill him, saying to each other:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Who is this, that saith the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> can resist <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king Nabuchodonosor</a>, and his armies, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unarmed, and without force, and without skill in the art of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> That Achior therefore may know that he deceiveth us, let us go up into the mountains: and when the bravest of them shall be taken, then shall he with them be stabbed with the sword,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> That every nation may know that <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> is god of the earth, and besides him there is no other.</span></p>
