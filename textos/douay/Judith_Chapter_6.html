<h1>Judith Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">Holofernes in great rage sends Achior to Bethulia, there to be slain with the Israelites.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass when they had left off speaking, that Holofernes being in a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> passion, said to Achior:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Because thou hast <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> unto us, saying: That the nation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is defended by their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to show thee that there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> When we shall slay them all as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then thou also shalt die with them by the sword of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall perish with thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And thou shalt find that <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> is lord of the whole earth: and then the sword of my soldiers shall pass through thy sides, and thou shalt be stabbed and fall among the wounded of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and thou shalt breathe no more till thou be destroyed with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But if thou think thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, let not thy countenance sink, and let the paleness that is in thy face, depart from thee, if thou imaginest these my words cannot be accomplished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And that thou mayst know that thou shalt experience these things together with them, behold from this hour thou shalt be associated to their people, that when they shall receive the punishment they deserve from my sword, thou mayst fall under the same vengeance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then Holofernes commanded his servants to take Achior, and to lead him to <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, and to deliver him into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the servants of Holofernes taking him, went through the plains: but when they came near the mountains, the slingers came out against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then turning out of the way by the side of the mountain, they tied Achior to a tree hand and foot, and so left him bound with ropes, and returned to their master.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> coming down from <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, came to him, and loosing him they brought him to <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, and setting him in the midst of the people, asked him what was the matter that the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> had left him bound.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> In those days the rulers there, were <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> the son of Micha of the <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">tribe of Simeon</a>, and Charmi, called also Gothoniel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Achior related in the midst of the ancients, and in the presence of all the people, all that he had said being asked by Holofernes: and how the people of Holofernes would have killed him for this word,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And how Holofernes himself being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> had commanded him to be delivered for this cause to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>: that when he should overcome the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, then he might command Achior also himself to be put to death by diverse torments, for having said: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is their defender.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when Achior had declared all these things, all the people fell upon their faces, adoring the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and all of them together mourning and weeping poured out their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with one accord to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Saying: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, behold their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and look on our low condition, and have regard to the face of thy saints, and show that thou forsakest not them that trust on thee, and that thou <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humblest</a> them that presume of themselves, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their own strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So when their weeping was ended, and the people's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in which they continued all the day, was concluded, they comforted Achior,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, whose power thou hast set forth, will make this return to thee, that thou rather shalt see their destruction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> shall give this liberty to his servants, let <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be with thee also in the midst of us: that as it shall please thee, so thou with all thine mayst converse with us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a>, after the assembly was broken up, received him into his house, and made him a great supper.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And all the ancients were invited, and they refreshed themselves together after their fast was over.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And afterwards all the people were called together, and they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> all the night long within the church, desiring help of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The church...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> or place where they met for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</span></span></p>
