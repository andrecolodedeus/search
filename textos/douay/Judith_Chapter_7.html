<h1>Judith Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">Holofernes besieges Bethulia. The distress of the besieged.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But Holofernes on the next day gave orders to his army, to go up against Bethulia.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Now there were in his troops a hundred and twenty thousand footmen, and two and twenty thousand horsemen, besides the preparations of those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who had been taken, and who had been brought away out of the provinces and cities of all the youth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> All these prepared themselves together to fight against the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and they came by the hillside to the top, which looketh toward Dothain, from the place which is called Belma, unto Chelmon, which is over against Esdrelon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, when they saw the multitude of them, prostrated themselves upon the ground, putting ashes upon their heads, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> with one accord, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> would show his mercy upon his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And taking their arms of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, they posted themselves at the places, which by a narrow pathway lead directly between the mountains, and they guarded them all day and night.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now Holofernes, in going round about, found that the fountain which supplied them with water, ran through an aqueduct without the city on the south side: and he commanded their aqueduct to be cut off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Nevertheless there were springs not far from the walls, out of which they were seen secretly to draw water, to refresh themselves a little rather than to drink their fill.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a> and <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> came to Holofernes, saying: The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> trust not in their spears, nor in their arrows, but the mountains are their defence, and the steep hills and precipices guard them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Wherefore that thou mayst overcome them without joining battle, set guards at the springs that they may not draw water out of them, and thou shalt destroy them without sword, or at least being wearied out they will yield up their city, which they suppose, because it is situate in the mountains, to be impregnable.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And these words pleased Holofernes, and his officers, and he placed all round about a hundred <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> at every spring.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when they had kept this watch for full twenty days, the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cisterns</a>, and the reserve of waters failed among all the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, so that there was not within the city, enough to satisfy them, no not for one day, for water was daily given out to the people by measure.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then all the men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, young men, and children, gathering themselves together to <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a>, all together with one voice,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be judge between us and thee, for thou hast done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against us, in that thou wouldst not speak peaceably with the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and for this cause <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sold us into their hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And therefore there is no one to help us, while we are cast down before their eyes in thirst, and sad destruction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And now assemble ye all that are in the city, that we may of our own accord yield ourselves all up to the people of Holofernes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For it is better, that being captives we should live and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, than that we should die, and be a reproach to all flesh, after we have seen our wives and our infants die before our eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> We call to witness this day <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, who taketh vengeance upon us according to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, conjuring you to deliver now the city into the hand of the army of Holofernes, that our end may be short by the edge of the sword, which is made longer by the drought of thirst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when they had said these things, there was great weeping and lamentation of all in the assembly, and for many hours with one voice they cried to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> with our fathers, we have done <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, we have committed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Have thou mercy on us, because thou art <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, or punish our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> by chastising us thyself, and deliver not them that trust in thee to a people that knoweth not thee,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> That they may not say among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: Where is their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when being wearied with these cries, and tired with these weepings, they held their peace,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> rising up all in tears, said: Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, my brethren, and let us wait these five days for mercy from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For perhaps he will put a stop to his indignation, and will give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to his own <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But if after five days be past there come no aid, we will do the things which you have spoken.</span></p>
