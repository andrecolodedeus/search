<h1>Judith Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="h1a">The character of Judith, and her discourse to the ancients.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now it came to pass, when Judith a widow had heard these words, who was the daughter of Merari, the son of Idox, the son of Joseph, the son of <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a>, the son of Elai, the son of Jamnor, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Achitob, the son of Melchias, the son of Enan, the son of Nathanias, the son of Salathiel, the son of Simeon, the son of <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>Simeon the son of Ruben...</strong> In the Greek, it is the son of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. For <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon the patriarch</a>, from whom Judith descended, was not the son, but the brother of <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>. It seems more probable that the Simeon and the Ruben here mentioned are not the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarchs</a>: but two of the descendants of the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarch</a> <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>: and that the <a href="../cathen/06408a.htm">genealogy</a> of Judith, recorded in this place, is not carried up so high as the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarchs</a>. No more than that of Elcana the father of Samuel [<a href="../douay/1sa001.htm#verse1">1 Samuel 1:1</a>] and that of <a href="../cathen/13486d.htm">king Saul</a> [<a href="../douay/1sa009.htm#verse1">1 Samuel 9:1</a>].</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And her husband was <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, who died in the time of the barley harvest:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For he was standing over them that bound sheaves in the field; and the heat came upon his head, and he died in <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a> his own city, and was buried there with his fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And Judith his relict was a widow now three years and six months.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And she made herself a private chamber in the upper part of her house, in which she abode shut up with her maids.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And she wore haircloth upon her loins, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> all the days of her life, except the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and new moons, and the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And she was exceedingly beautiful, and her husband left her great riches, and very many servants, and large <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a> of herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And she was greatly renowned among all, because she feared the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> very much, neither was there any one that spoke an ill word of her.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> When therefore she had heard that <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> had promised that he would deliver up the city after the fifth day, she sent to the ancients Chabri and Charmi.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they came to her, and she said to them: What is this word, by which <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> hath consented to give up the city to the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, if within five days there come no aid to us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And who are you that tempt the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> This is not a word that may draw down mercy, but rather that may stir up <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and enkindle indignation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> You have set a time for the mercy of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and you have appointed him a day, according to your pleasure.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is patient, let us be penitent for this same thing, and with many tears let us beg his pardon:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not threaten like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor be inflamed to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And therefore let us <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> before him, and continuing in an <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> spirit, in his service:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Let us ask the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with tears, that according to his will so he would show his mercy to us: that as our heart is troubled by their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, so also we may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> in our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For we have not followed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of our fathers, who forsook their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and worshipped strange gods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For which crime they were given up to their enemies, to the sword, and to pillage, and to confusion: but we know no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Let us humbly wait for his consolation, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a> will require our blood of the afflictions of our enemies, and he will <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> all the nations that shall rise up against us, and bring them to disgrace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And now, brethren, as you are the ancients among the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> resteth upon you: comfort their hearts by your speech, that they may be mindful how our fathers were tempted that they might be proved, whether they worshipped their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> They must remember how our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was tempted, and being proved by many tribulations, was made the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> So <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, so <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, so <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and all that have pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, passed through many tribulations, remaining <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But they that did not receive the trials with the fear of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, but uttered their impatience and the reproach of their murmuring against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Were destroyed by the destroyer, and perished by serpents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> As for us therefore let us not revenge ourselves for these things which we suffer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But esteeming these very punishments to be less than our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> deserve, let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these scourges of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, with which like servants we are chastised, have happened for our amendment, and not for our destruction.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> and the ancients said to her: All things which thou hast spoken are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and there is nothing to be reprehended in thy words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Now therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, for thou art a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and one fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And Judith said to them: As you know that what I have been able to say is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So that which I intend to do prove ye if it be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may strengthen my design.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> You shall stand at the gate this night, and I will go out with my maidservant: and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> ye, that as you have said, in five days the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may look down upon his people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But I desire that you search not into what I am doing, and till I bring you word let nothing else be done but to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> the prince of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said to her: Go in peace, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be with thee to take revenge of our enemies. So returning they departed.</span></p>
