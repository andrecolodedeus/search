<h1>Judith Chapter 9</h1>
<div class="h1a">Judith's prayer, to beg of God to fortify her in her undertaking.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when they were gone, Judith went into her oratory: and putting on haircloth, laid ashes on her head: and falling down prostrate before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, she cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of my father <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>, who gavest him a sword to execute vengeance against strangers, who had defiled by their <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>, and uncovered the virgin unto confusion: <span class="stiki"><strong>Gavest him a sword, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is here praised, in punishing by the sword of <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a> the crime of the <a href="../cathen/13771b.htm">Sichemites</a>: and not the act of <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a>, which was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned by his father <a href="../douay/gen049.htm#verse5">Genesis 49:5</a>. Though even with regard to this <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, we may distinguish between his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against the crime committed by the ravishers of his sister, which <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> may be considered <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: and the manner of his punishing that crime, which was irregular and excessive.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And who gavest their wives to be made a prey, and their daughters into captivity: and all their spoils to be divided to the servants, who were zealous with thy zeal: assist, I beseech thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, me a widow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For thou hast done the things of old, and hast devised one thing after another: and what thou hast designed hath been done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For all thy ways are prepared, and in thy <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> thou hast placed thy judgments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Look upon the camp of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> now, as thou wast pleased to look upon the camp of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, when they pursued armed after thy servants, trusting in their chariots, and in their horsemen, and in a multitude of warriors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But thou lookedst over their camp, and darkness wearied them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">deep</a> held their feet, and the waters overwhelmed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So may it be with these also, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who trust in their multitude, and in their chariots, and in their pikes, and in their shields, and in their arrows, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their spears,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And know not that thou art our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who destroyest wars from the beginning, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Lift up thy arm as from the beginning, and crush their power with thy power: let their power fall in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, who promise themselves to violate thy sanctuary, and defile the dwelling place of thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and to beat down with their sword the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horn of thy altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Bring to pass, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> may be cut off with his own sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Let him be caught in the net of his own eyes in my regard, and do thou strike him by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of the words of my lips.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Give me constancy in my mind, that I may <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> him: and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> that I may overthrow him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For this will be a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> monument for thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, when he shall fall by the hand of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For thy power, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, is not in a multitude, nor is thy pleasure in the strength of horses, nor from the beginning have the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> been acceptable to thee: but the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and the meek hath always pleased thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, creator of the waters, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of the whole creation, hear me a poor wretch, making supplication to thee, and presuming of thy mercy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Remember, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thy covenant, and put thou words in my mouth, and strengthen the resolution in my heart, that thy house may continue in thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And all nations may acknowledge that thou art <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no other besides thee.</span></p>
