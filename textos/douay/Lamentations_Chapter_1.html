<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="preface"></span> And it came to pass, after <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was carried into captivity, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was desolate, that <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a> sat weeping, and mourned with this lamentation over <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and with a sorrowful mind, sighing and moaning, he said: <span class="stiki"><strong>And it came to pass, etc...</strong> This preface was not written by Jeremias, but was added by the seventy interpreters, to give the reader to understand upon what occasion the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lamentations<!--</a>--> were published.</span></span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <em>Aleph.</em> How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! how is the mistress of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> become as a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>: the princes of provinces made tributary!</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <em>Beth.</em> Weeping, she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear to her: all her friends have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> her, and are become her enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <em>Ghimel.</em> <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> hath removed her dwelling place, because of her affliction, and the greatness of her bondage; she hath dwelt among the nations, and she hath found no rest; all her persecutors have taken her in the midst of straits.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <em>Daleth.</em> The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the solemn feast: all her gates are broken down; her <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sigh; her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are in affliction; and she is oppressed with bitterness.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> <em>He.</em> Her adversaries are become her lords; her enemies are enriched; because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken against her for the multitude of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>; her children are led into captivity, before the face of the oppressor.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <em>Vau.</em> And from the daughter of Sion, all her beauty is departed; her princes are become like rams that find no pastures; and they are gone away without strength before the face of the pursuer.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <em>Zain.</em> <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> hath remembered the days of her affliction, and prevarication of all her desirable things which she had from the days of old, when her people fell in the enemy's hand, and there was no helper; the enemies have seen her, and have mocked at her <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <em>Heth.</em> <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> hath grievously <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, therefore is she become unstable; all that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> her, have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> her, because they have seen her shame; but she sighed, and turned backward.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <em>Teth.</em> Her filthiness is on her feet, and she hath not remembered her end; she is wonderfully cast down, not having a comforter: behold, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my affliction, because the enemy is lifted up.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> <em>Jod.</em> The enemy hath put out his hand to all her desirable things: for she hath seen the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> enter into her sanctuary, of whom thou gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <em>Caph.</em> All her people sigh, they seek bread: they have given all their precious things for food to relieve the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: see, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and consider, for I am become vile.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <em>Lamed.</em> O all ye that pass by the way, attend, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow: for he hath made a vintage of me, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke in the day of his fierce <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <em>Mem.</em> From above he hath sent fire into my bones, and hath chastised me: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate, wasted with sorrow all the day long.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <em>Nun.</em> The yoke of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> hath watched: they are folded together in his hand, and put upon my neck: my strength is weakened: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath delivered me into a hand, out of which I am not able to rise.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <em>Samech.</em> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath taken away all my mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> out of the midst of me: he hath called against me the time, to destroy my chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath trodden the winepress for the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> daughter of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <em>Ain.</em> Therefore do I weep, and my eyes run down with water: because the comforter, the relief of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is far from me: my children are desolate because the enemy hath prevailed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <em>Phe.</em> Sion hath spread forth her hands, there is none to comfort her: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath commanded against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, his enemies are round about him: <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is as a menstruous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> among them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <em>Sade.</em> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, for I have provoked his mouth to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: hear, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, all ye people, and see my sorrow: my <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and my young men are gone into captivity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <em>Coph.</em> I called for my friends, but they deceived me: my <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and my ancients pined away in the city: while they sought their food, to relieve their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <em>Res.</em> Behold, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for I am in distress, my bowels are troubled: my heart is turned within me, for I am full of bitterness: abroad the sword destroyeth and at home there is death alike.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <em>Sin.</em> They have heard that I sigh, and there is none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard of my <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they have rejoiced that thou hast done it: thou hast brought a day of consolation, and they shall be like unto me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <em>Thau.</em> Let all their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be present before thee: and make vintage of them, as thou hast made vintage of me for all my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>: for my sighs are many, and my heart is sorrowful.</span></blockquote>
