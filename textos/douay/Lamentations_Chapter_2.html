<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <em>Daleth.</em> He hath bent his bow as an enemy, he hath fixed his right hand as an adversary: and he hath killed all that was fair to behold in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion, he hath poured out his indignation like fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> <em>He.</em> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is become as an enemy: he hath cast down <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> headlong, he hath overthrown all the walls thereof: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath multiplied in the daughter of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> the afflicted, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <em>Vau.</em> And he hath destroyed his tent as a garden, he hath thrown down his tabernacle: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath caused feasts and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> to be forgotten in Sion: and hath delivered up king and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to reproach, and to the indignation of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <em>Heth.</em> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Sion: he hath stretched out his line, and hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: and the bulwark hath mourned, and the wall hath been destroyed together.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <em>Teth.</em> Her gates are sunk into the ground: he hath destroyed, and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: the law is no more, and her <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have found no vision from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> <em>Jod.</em> The ancients of the daughter of Sion sit upon the ground, they have held their peace: they have sprinkled their heads with dust, they are girded with haircloth, the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> hang down their heads to the ground.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <em>Caph.</em> My eyes have failed with weeping, my bowels are troubled: my liver is poured out upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people, when the children, and the sucklings, fainted away in the streets of the city.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <em>Lamed.</em> They said to their mothers: Where is corn and wine? when they fainted away as the wounded in the streets of the city: when they breathed out their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the bosoms of their mothers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <em>Mem.</em> To what shall I compare thee? or to what shall I liken thee, O daughter of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>? to what shall I equal thee, that I may comfort thee, O <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> daughter of Sion? for great as the sea is thy destruction: who shall heal thee?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <em>Nun.</em> Thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have seen <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and foolish things for thee: and they have not laid open thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, to excite thee to <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>: but they have seen for thee <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> revelations and banishments.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <em>Samech.</em> All they that passed by the way have clapped their hands at thee: they have hissed, and wagged their heads at the daughter of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying: Is this the city of perfect beauty, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of all the earth?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <em>Phe.</em> All thy enemies have opened their month against thee: they have hissed, and gnashed with the teeth, and have said: We will swallow her up: lo, this is the day which we looked for: we have found it, we have seen it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <em>Ain.</em> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath done that which he purposed, he hath fulfilled his word, which he commanded in the days of old: he hath destroyed, and hath not spared, and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, and hath set up the horn of thy adversaries.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <em>Sade.</em> Their heart cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> upon the walls of the daughter of Sion: Let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give thyself no rest, and let not the apple of thy eye cease.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <em>Coph.</em> Arise, give praise in the night, in the beginning of the watches: pour out thy heart like water, before the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: lift up thy hands to him for the life of thy little children, that have fainted for hunger at the top of all the streets.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <em>Res.</em> Behold, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and consider whom thou hast thus dealt with: shall <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> then eat their own fruit, their children of a span long? shall the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> be slain in the sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <em>Sin.</em> The child and the old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lie without on the ground: my <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain them in the day of thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: thou hast killed, and shown them no pity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <em>Thau.</em> Thou hast called as to a festival, those that should terrify me round about, and there was none in the day of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that escaped and was left: those that I brought up, and nourished, my enemy hath consumed them.</span></blockquote>
