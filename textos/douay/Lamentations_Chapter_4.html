<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <em>Aleph.</em> How is the gold become dim, the finest colour is changed, the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <em>Beth.</em> The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter's hands?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <em>Ghimel.</em> Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <em>Daleth.</em> The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> <em>He.</em> They that were fed delicately have died in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <em>Vau.</em> And the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the daughter of my people is made greater than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <em>Zain.</em> Her <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarites</a> were whiter than snow, purer than milk, more ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <em>Heth.</em> Their face is now made blacker than coals, and they are not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is withered, and is become like wood.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <em>Teth.</em> It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than with them that died with hunger: for these pined away being consumed for want of the fruits of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> <em>Jod.</em> The hands of the pitiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <em>Caph.</em> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath accomplished his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, he hath poured out his fierce <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <em>Lamed.</em> The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that the adversary and the enemy should enter in by the gates of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <em>Mem.</em> For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of her <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> of her <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that have shed the blood of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> in the midst of her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <em>Nun.</em> They have wandered as blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the streets, they were defiled with blood: and when they could not help walking in it, they held up their skirts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <em>Samech.</em> Depart you that are defiled, they cried out to them: Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed, they said among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: He will no more dwell among them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <em>Phe.</em> The face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath divided them, he will no more regard them: they respected not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, neither had they pity on the ancient.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <em>Ain.</em> While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not able to save.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <em>Sade.</em> Our steps have slipped in the way of our streets, our end draweth near: our days are fulfilled, for our end is come.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <em>Coph.</em> Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the air: they pursued us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <em>Res.</em> The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: to whom we said: Under thy shadow we shall live among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Christ, etc...</strong> This, according to the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a>, is spoken of their king, who is called the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Christ<!--</a>-->, that is, the Anointed of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. But it also relates, in the spiritual sense, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ our Lord</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->suffering<!--</a>--> for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <em>Sin.</em> Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, that dwellest in the land of Hus: to thee also shall the cup come, thou shalt be made drunk, and naked.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <em>Thau.</em> Thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> is accomplished, O daughter of Sion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he hath visited thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, O daughter of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, he hath discovered thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></blockquote>
