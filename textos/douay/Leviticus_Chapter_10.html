<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Nadab and Abiu, the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, taking their <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, put fire therein, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> on it, <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> strange fire: which was not commanded them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And fire coming out from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> destroyed them: and they died before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: This is what the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken. I will be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> in them that approach to me: and I will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the sight of all the people. And when <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> heard this, he held his peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> called Misael and Elisaphan, the sons of Oziel, the uncle of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and said to them: Go and take away your brethren from before the sanctuary, and carry them without the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they went forthwith and took them as they lay, <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vested</a> with linen <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunicks</a>, and cast them forth, as had been commanded them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> and Ithamar, his sons: Uncover not your heads, and rend not your garments, lest perhaps you die, and indignation come upon all the congregation. Let your brethren, and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, bewail the burning which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> has kindled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But you shall not go out of the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>: otherwise you shall perish, for the oil of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unction is on you. And they did all things according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">precept of Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> You shall not drink wine nor any thing that may make drunk, thou nor thy sons, when you enter into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>, lest you die. Because it is an everlasting <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precept</a>; through your <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And that you may have knowledge to discern between <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unholy, between <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean and clean</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And may teach the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> all my ordinances which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken to them by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> and Ithamar, his sons that were left: Take the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> that is remaining of the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and eat it <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">without leaven</a> beside the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, because it is holy of holies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And you shall eat it in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place: which is given to thee and thy sons of the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as it hath been commanded me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The breast also that is offered, and the shoulder that is separated, you shall eat in a most clean place, thou and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee. For they are set aside for thee and thy children, of the victims of peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Because they have elevated before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the shoulder and the breast, and the fat that is burnt on the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: and they belong to thee and to thy sons by a perpetual <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> While these things were a doing, when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sought for the buck goat, that had been offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he found it burnt. And being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> and Ithamar, the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> that were left, he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Why did you not eat in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and given to you, that you may bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of the people, and may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Especially, whereas none of the blood thereof hath been carried within the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places: and you ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as was commanded me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> answered: This day hath been offered the victim for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and to me what thou seest has happened. How could I eat it, or please the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, having a sorrowful heart?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had heard he was satisfied.</span></p>
