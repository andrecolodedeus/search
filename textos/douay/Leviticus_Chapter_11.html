<div class="h1a">The distinction of clean and unclean animals.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Say to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: These are the animals which you are to eat of all the living things of the earth. <span class="stiki"><strong>Animals which you are to eat, etc...</strong> The prohibition of so many kinds of beasts, birds, and fishes, in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, was ordered, 1st, to exercise the people in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>; 2ndly, to restrain them from the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of which these animals were <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>; 3rdly, because the things here forbidden were for the most part unwholesome, and not proper to be eaten; 4thly, that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">people of God</a>, by being obliged to abstain from things corporally <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, might be trained up to seek a spiritual cleanness.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Whatsoever hath the hoof divided, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, you shall eat. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hoof divided, and cheweth the cud...</strong> The dividing of the hoof and chewing of the cud, signify discretion between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and meditating on the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and where either of these is wanting a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. In like manner fishes were reputed <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> that had not fins and scales: that is, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that did not raise themselves up by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and cover themselves with the scales of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But whatsoever cheweth indeed the cud, and hath a hoof, but divideth it not, as the camel, and others: that you shall not eat, but shall reckon it among the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The cherogrillus which cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof, is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The cherogrillus...</strong> Some suppose it to be the rabbit, others the hedgehog. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> intimates that it is another kind of animal common in Palestine, which lives in the holes of rocks or in the earth. We choose here, as also in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of several other creatures that follow (which are little known in this part of the world), to keep the Greek or <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The hare also: for that too cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the swine, which, though it divideth the hoof, cheweth not the cud.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The flesh of these you shall not eat, nor shall you touch their carcasses, because they are <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> to you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> These are the things that breed in the waters, and which it is lawful to eat. All that hath fins, and scales, as well in the sea, as in the rivers, and the <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pools</a>, you shall eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But whatsoever hath not fins and scales, of those things that move and live in the waters, shall be an abomination to you,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And detestable. Their flesh you shall not eat: and their carcasses you shall avoid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> All that have not fins and scales, in the waters, shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Of birds these are they which you must not eat, and which are to be avoided by you: The eagle, and the griffon, and the osprey. <span class="stiki"><strong>The griffon...</strong> Not the monster which the painter represent, which hath no being upon earth; but a bird of the eagle kind, larger than the common.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the kite, and the vulture, according to their kind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And all that is of the raven kind, according to their likeness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The ostrich, and the owl, and the larus, and the hawk according to its kind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The screech owl, and the cormorant, and the ibis.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the swan, and the bittern, and the porphyrion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The heron, and the charadroin according to its kind, the houp also, and the bat.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Of things that fly, whatsoever goeth upon four feet, shall be abominable to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But whatsoever walketh upon four feet, but hath the legs behind longer, wherewith it hoppeth upon the earth,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> That you shall eat: as the bruchus in its kind, the attacus, and ophimachus, and the locust, every, one according to their kind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But of flying things whatsoever hath four feet only, shall be an abomination to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And whosoever shall touch the carcasses of them, shall be defiled: and shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> until the evening:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And if it be necessary that he carry any of these things when they are dead: he shall wash his clothes, and shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> until the sun set.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Every beast that hath a hoof, but divideth it not, nor cheweth the cud shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: and he that toucheth it, shall be defiled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> That which walketh upon hands of all animals which go on all four, shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: he that shall touch their carcasses shall be defiled until evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he that shall carry such carcasses, shall wash his clothes, and shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> until evening: because all these things are <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> These also shall be reckoned among <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> things, of all that move upon the earth. The weasel, and the mouse, and the crocodile, every one according to their kind:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> The shrew, and the chameleon, and the stellio, and the lizard, and the mole.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> All these are <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. He that toucheth their carcasses shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> until the evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And upon what thing soever any of their carcasses shall fall, it shall be defiled, whether it be a vessel of wood, or a garment, or skins or haircloths: or any thing in which work is done. They shall be dipped in water, and shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> until the evening, and so afterwards shall be clean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But an earthen vessel, into which any of these shall fall, shall be defiled: and therefore is to be broken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Any meat which you eat, if water from such a vessel be poured upon it, shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>; and every liquor that is drunk out of any such vessel, shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And upon whatsoever thing any of these dead beasts shall fall, it shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. Whether it be oven, or pots with feet, they shall be destroyed, and shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But fountains and <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cisterns</a>, and all gatherings together of waters shall be clean. He that toucheth their carcasses shall be defiled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> If it fall upon seed corn, it shall not defile it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pour water upon the seed, and afterwards it be touched by the carcasses, it shall be forthwith defiled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> If any beast die, of which it is lawful for you to eat, he that toucheth the carcass thereof, shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> until the evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And he that eateth or carrieth any thing thereof, shall wash his clothes, and shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> until the evening.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> All that creepeth upon the earth shall be abominable: neither shall it be taken for meat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Whatsoever goeth upon the breast on four feet, or hath many feet, or traileth on the earth, you shall not eat, because it is abominable.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Do not defile your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, nor touch aught thereof, lest you be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> For I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>. Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> because I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Defile not your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by any creeping thing, that moveth upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> For I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who brought you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that I might be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> That you may know the differences of the clean, and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, and know what you ought to eat, and what to refuse.</span></p>
