<div class="h1a">The law concerning leprosy in men, and in garments.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in whose skin or flesh shall arise a different colour or a blister, or as it were something shining, that is the stroke of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, shall be brought to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or any or of his sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And if he see the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in his skin, and the hair turned white and the place where the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> appears lower than the skin and the rest of the flesh: it is the stroke of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, and upon his judgment he shall be separated.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But if there be a shining whiteness in the skin, and not lower than the other flesh, and the hair be of the former colour, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall shut him up seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the seventh day he shall look on him: and if the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> be grown no farther, and hath not spread itself in the skin, he shall shut him up again other seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And on the seventh day, he shall look on him. If the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> be somewhat obscure, and not spread in the skin, he shall declare him <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>, because it is but a scab: and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall wash his clothes, and shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But, if the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> grow again, after he was seen by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and restored to <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">cleanness</a>, he shall be brought to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And shall be condemned of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If the stroke of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> be in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he shall be brought to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he shall view him. And when there shall be a white colour in the skin, and it shall have changed the look of the hair, and the living flesh itself shall appear:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> It shall be judged an inveterate <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, and grown into the skin. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> therefore shall declare him <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>: and shall not shut him up, because he is evidently <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But if the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> spring out running about in the skin, and cover all the skin from the head to the feet, whatsoever falleth under the sight of the eyes:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall view him, and shall judge that the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> which he has is very clean: because it is all turned into whiteness, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be clean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But when the live flesh shall appear in him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then by the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he shall be defiled, and shall be reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. For live flesh, if it be spotted with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And if again it be turned into whiteness, and cover all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall view him, and shall judge him to be clean.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> When also there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin, and it has been healed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And in the place of the ulcer, there appeareth a white scar, or somewhat red, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be brought to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when he shall see the place of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> lower than the other flesh, and the hair turned white: he shall declare him <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, for the plague of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is broken out in the ulcer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But if the hair be of the former colour, and the scar somewhat obscure, and be not lower than the flesh that is near it: he shall shut him up seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And if it spread, he shall judge him to have the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But if it stay in its place, it is but the scar of an ulcer: and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be clean.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The flesh also and skin that hath been burnt, and after it is healed hath a white or a red scar:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall view it, and if he see it turned white, and the place thereof is lower than the other skin: he shall declare him <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is broken out in the scar.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But if the colour of the hair be not changed, nor the blemish lower than the other flesh, and the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> be somewhat obscure: he shall shut him up seven days,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And on the seventh day he shall view him. If the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> be grown farther in the skin, he shall declare him <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But if the whiteness stay in its place, and be not very clear, it is the sore of a burning: and therefore he shall be cleansed, because it is only the scar of a burning.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> If the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> break out in the head or the <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall see them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And if the place be lower than the other flesh, and the hair yellow, and thinner than usual: he shall declare them <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, because it is the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of the head and the <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh that is near it, and the hair black: he shall shut him up seven days,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And on the seventh day he shall look upon it. If the spot be not grown, and the hair keep its colour, and the place of the blemish be even with the other flesh:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be shaven all but the place of the spot: and he shall be shut up other seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> If on the seventh day the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> seem to have stayed in its place, and not lower than the other flesh, he shall cleanse him: and his clothes being washed he shall be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the skin:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow, because he is evidently <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But if the spot be stayed, and the hair be black, let him know that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is healed: and let him confidently pronounce him <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> If a whiteness appear in the skin of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall view them. If he find that a darkish whiteness shineth in the skin, let him know that it is not the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, but a white blemish, and that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose hair falleth off from his head, he is bald and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And if the hair fall from his forehead, he is bald before and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> But if in the bald head or in the bald forehead there be risen a white or reddish colour:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> perceive this, he shall condemn him undoubtedly of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> which is risen in the bald part.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Now whosoever shall be defiled with the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, and is separated by the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Shall have his clothes hanging loose, his head bare, his mouth covered with a cloth: and he shall cry out that he is defiled and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> All the time that he is a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> he shall dwell alone without the camp.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And he shall look upon it and shall shut it up seven days.</span>
