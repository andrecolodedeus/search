<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> This is the rite of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, when he is to be cleansed. He shall be brought to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Who going out of the camp, when he shall find that the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is cleansed,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Shall command him that is to be purified, to offer for himself two living sparrows, which it is lawful to eat, and <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar wood</a>, and scarlet, and <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he shall command one of the sparrows to be immolated in an earthen vessel over living waters. <span class="stiki"><strong>Living waters...</strong> That is, waters taken from a spring, brook, or river.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But the other that is alive, he shall dip, with the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar wood</a>, and the scarlet and the <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a>, in the blood of the sparrow that is immolated:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Wherewith he shall sprinkle him that is to be cleansed seven times, that he may be rightly purified. And he shall let go the living sparrow, that it may fly into the field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath washed his clothes, he shall shave all the hair of his body, and shall be washed with water: and being purified he shall enter into the camp, yet so that he tarry without his own tent seven days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And on the seventh day he shall shave the hair of his head, and his <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> and his eyebrows, and the hair of all his body. And having washed again his clothes, and his body,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> On the eighth day, he shall take two lambs without blemish, and an ewe of a year old without blemish, and three tenths of flour tempered with oil for a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and a sextary of oil apart. <span class="stiki"><strong>A sextary...</strong> <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>log</em>: a measure of liquids, which was the twelfth part of a hin; and held about as much as six eggs.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that purifieth the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, hath presented him, and all these things before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, at the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He shall take a lamb, and offer it for a trespass <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> with the sextary of oil. And having offered all before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He shall immolate the lamb, where the victim for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is wont to be immolated, and the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, that is, in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place. For as that which is for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also the victim for a trespass <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> pertaineth to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: it is holy of holies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> taking of the blood of the victim that was immolated for trespass, shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot. <span class="stiki"><strong>Taking of the blood, etc...</strong> These <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> used in the cleansing of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, were <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> and very <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">significative</a>. The sprinkling seven times with the blood of the little bird, the washing himself and his clothes, the shaving his hair and his <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, signify the means which are to be used in the reconciliation of a sinner, and the steps by which he is to return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, viz., by the repeated application of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: the washing his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> with the waters of compunction: and retrenching all vanities and superfluities, by employing all that is over and above what is necessary in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> deeds. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> or burnt <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a>, which he was to offer at his cleansing, signify the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heart, and that of <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> in spirit and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, with gratitude and thankfulness, for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, with which we are ever to appear before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty</a>. The touching the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the right foot, first with the blood of the victim, and then with the remainder of the oil, which had been sprinkled seven times before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, signify the application of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the unction of the sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; to the sinner's right ear, that he may duly hearken to and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and to his right hand and foot, that the works of his hands, and all the steps or affections of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, signified by the feet, may be rightly directed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he shall pour of the sextary of oil into his own left hand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And shall dip his right finger in it, and sprinkle it before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> seven times.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the rest of the oil in his left hand, he shall pour upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot, and upon the blood that was shed for trespass:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And upon his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and shall offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Then shall he immolate the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And put it on the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> with the libations thereof: and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be rightly cleansed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But if he be <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and his hand cannot find the things aforesaid: he shall take a lamb for an <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> for trespass, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him, and a tenth part of flour tempered with oil for a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and a sextary of oil:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And two turtles or two young pigeons, of which one may be for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the other for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he shall offer them on the eighth day of his purification to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, at the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> receiving the lamb for trespass, and the sextary of oil, shall elevate them together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the lamb being immolated, he shall put of the blood thereof upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and the great toe of his right foot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But he shall pour part of the oil into his own left hand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And dipping the finger of his right hand in it, he shall sprinkle it seven times before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he shall touch the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot, in the place of the blood that was shed for trespass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the other part of the oil that is in his left hand, he shall pour upon the head of the purified person, that he may appease the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he shall offer a turtle, or young pigeon:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> This is the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, that is not able to have all things that appertain to his cleansing.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> When you shall come into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, which I will give you for a possession, if there be the plague or <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in a house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> He whose house it is, shall go and tell the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, saying: It seemeth to me, that there is the plague of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in my house,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he shall command, that they carry forth all things out of the house, before he go into it, and see whether it have the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, let all things become <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> that are in the house. And afterwards he shall go in to view the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And if he see in the walls thereof as it were little dints, disfigured with paleness or redness, and lower than all he rest:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> He shall go out of the door of the house, and forthwith shut it up seven days,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And returning on the seventh day, he shall look upon it. If he find that the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is spread,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> He shall command, that the stones wherein the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> is, be taken out, and cast without the city into an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> place:</span>
