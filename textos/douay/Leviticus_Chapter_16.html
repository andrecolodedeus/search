<div class="h1a">When and how the high priest must enter into the sanctuary. The feast of expiation.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, after the death of the two sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> when they were slain upon their <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> strange fire:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he commanded him, saying: Speak to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> thy brother, that he enter not at all into the sanctuary, which is within the veil before the propitiatory, with which the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> is covered, lest he die, (for I will appear in a cloud over the oracle), <span class="stiki"><strong>Enter not...</strong> No one but the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and he but <a href="../cathen/02054a.htm">once a year</a>, could enter into the sanctuary; to signify that no one could enter into the sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, till <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> opened it by his <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>. <a href="../douay/heb010.htm#verse8">Hebrews 10:8</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Unless he first do these things. He shall offer a calf for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and a ram for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He shall be <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vested</a> with a linen <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunick</a>: he shall cover his nakedness with linen breeches: he shall be girded with a linen girdle, and he shall put a linen <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> upon his head. For these are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>: all which he shall put on, after he is washed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he shall receive from the whole multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> two buck goats for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and one ram for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when he hath offered the cattle and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for himself and for his own house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He shall make the two buck goats to stand before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And casting lots upon them both, one to be offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the other to be the emissary goat:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> That whose lot fell to be offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, he shall offer for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But that whose lot was to be the emissary goat, he shall present before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that he may pour <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> upon him, and let him go into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> After these things are duly celebrated, he shall offer the calf: and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for himself and for his own house, he shall immolate it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And taking the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a>, which he hath filled with the burning coals of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and taking up with his hands the compounded perfume for <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, he shall go in within the veil into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> That when the perfumes are put upon the fire, the cloud and vapour thereof may cover the oracle, which is over the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">testimony</a>, and he may not die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He shall take also of the blood of the calf, and sprinkle with his finger seven times towards the propitiatory to the east.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when he hath killed the buck goat for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the people, he shall carry in the blood thereof within the veil, as he was commanded to do with the blood of the calf, that he may sprinkle it over against the oracle:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And may expiate the sanctuary from the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and from their transgressions, and all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. According to this <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">rite</a> shall he do to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>, which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of their habitation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> be in the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> when the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> goeth into the sanctuary, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for himself and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">house</a>, and for the whole congregation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, until he come out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when he is come out to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> that is before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for himself: and taking the blood of the calf, and of the buck goat, let him pour it upon the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horns</a> thereof round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And sprinkling with his finger seven times, let him expiate, and sanctify it from the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> After he hath cleaned the sanctuary, and the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, then let him offer the living goat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And putting both hands upon his head, let him confess all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and all their offences and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that they may light on its head, he shall turn him out by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ready for it, into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when the goat hath carried all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> into an uninhabited land, and shall be let go into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> shall return into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>, and putting off the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, which he had on him before when he entered into the sanctuary, and leaving them there,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He shall wash his flesh in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, and shall put on his own garments. And after that he is come out and hath offered his own <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and that of the people, he shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> both for himself, and for the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the fat that is offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he shall burn on the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But he that hath let go the emissary goat, shall wash his clothes, and his body with water, and so shall enter into the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But the calf and the buck goat, that were <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and whose blood was carried into the sanctuary, to accomplish the <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement</a>, they shall carry forth without the camp, and shall burn with fire: their skins and their flesh, and their dung.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And whosoever burneth them shall wash his clothes, and flesh with water: and so shall enter into the camp.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And this shall be to you an everlasting ordinance.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Upon this day shall be the expiation for you, and the cleansing from all your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. You shall be cleansed before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For it is a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> of rest: and you shall afflict your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by a perpetual <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that is anointed, and whose hands are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to do the office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in his father's stead, shall make <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement</a>.
