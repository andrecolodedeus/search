<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But only for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kin</a>, such as are near in blood: that is to say, for his father and for his mother, and for his son, and for his daughter, for his brother also:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And for a maiden sister, who hath had no husband.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Neither shall he approach to minister to him: If he be blind; if he be lame; if he have a little, or a great, or a crooked nose;</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> If he be crookbacked; or blear eyed; or have a pearl in his eye, or a continual scab, or a dry scurf in his body, or a rupture.</span>
