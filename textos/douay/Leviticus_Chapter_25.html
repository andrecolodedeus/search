<div class="h1a">The law of the seventh and of the fiftieth year of jubilee.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount Sinai</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Speak to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall have entered into the land which I will give you, observe the rest of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But in the seventh year there shall be a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> to the land, of the resting of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Thou shalt not sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> What the ground shall bring forth of itself, thou shalt not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes or the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> as a vintage. For it is a year of rest to the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But they shall be unto you for meat, to thee and to thy manservant, to thy maidservant and thy hireling, and to the strangers that sojourn with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy cattle.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years: that is to say, seven times seven, which together make forty-nine years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month, the tenth day of the month, in the time of the expiation in all your land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year, and shalt proclaim remission to all the inhabitants of thy land: for it is the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">year of jubilee</a>. Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall return to his possession, and every one shall go back to his former <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>Remission...</strong> That is, a general release and discharge from <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> and <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondage</a>, and a reinstating of every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his former <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Because it is the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">fiftieth year</a>. You shall not sow, nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord, neither shall you gather the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of the vines,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Because of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctification</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a>. But as they grow you shall presently eat them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> In the year of the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a> all shall return to their possessions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour, or shalt buy of him: grieve not thy brother. But thou shalt buy of him according to the number of years from the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the fruits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The more years remain after the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a>, the more shall the price increase: and the less time is counted, so much the less shall the purchase cost. For he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Do not afflict your countrymen: but let every one fear his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Do my <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, and keep my judgments, and fulfil them: that you may dwell in the land without any fear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the ground may yield you its fruits, of which you may eat your fill, fearing no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> invasion.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But if you say: What shall we eat the seventh year, if we sow not, nor gather our fruits?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I will give you my <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the sixth year: and it shall yield the fruits of three years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the eighth year you shall sow, and shall eat of the old fruits, until the ninth year: till new grow up, you shall eat the old store.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The land also shall not be sold for ever: because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For which cause all the country of your possession shall be under the condition of <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redemption</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> If thy brother being <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">impoverished</a> sell his little possession, and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsman</a> will: he may <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> what he had sold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But if he have no <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsman</a>, and he himself can find the price to <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> The value of the fruits shall be counted from that time when he sold it. And the overplus he shall restore to the buyer, and so shall receive his possession again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But if his hands find not the means to repay the price, the buyer shall have what he bought, until the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">year of the jubilee</a>. For in that year all that is sold shall return to the owner, and to the ancient possessor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> He that selleth a house within the walls of a city, shall have the liberty to <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> it, until one year be expired.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> If he <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> it not, and the whole year be fully out, the buyer shall possess it, and his posterity for ever, and it cannot be <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a>, not even in the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But if the house be in a <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">village</a>, that hath no walls, it shall be sold according to the same <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> as the fields. If it be not <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a> before, in the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a> it shall return to the owner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> The houses of <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, which are in cities, may always be <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> If they be not <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a> they shall all return to the owners: because the houses of the cities of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> are for their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But let not their suburbs be sold, because it is a perpetual possession.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> If thy brother be <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">impoverished</a>, and weak of hand, and thou receive him as a stranger and sojourner, and he live with thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Take not <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> of him nor more than thou gavest. Fear thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that thy brother may live with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Thou shalt not give him thy money upon <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>: nor exact of him any increase of fruits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, who brought you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that I might give you the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and might be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> If thy brother constrained by poverty, sell himself to thee: thou shalt not oppress him with the service of <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondservants</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But he shall be as a hireling, and a sojourner: he shall work with thee until the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">year of the jubilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And afterwards he shall go out with his children: and shall return to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a> and to the possession of his fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> For they are my servants, and I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: let them not be sold as <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondmen</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Afflict him not by might: but fear thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Let your <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondmen</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">bondwomen</a>, be of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> that are round about you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And of the strangers that sojourn among you, or that were born of them in your land. These you shall have for servants:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And by right of inheritance shall leave them to your posterity, and shall possess them for ever. But oppress not your brethren the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> by might.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> If the hand of a stranger or a sojourner grow strong among you, and thy brother being <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">impoverished</a> sell himself to him, or to any of his race:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> After the sale he may be <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a>. He that will of his brethren shall <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, or his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsman</a>, by blood, or by <a href="../cathen/01177c.htm">affinity</a>. But if he himself be able also, he shall <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> himself:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Counting only the years from the time of his selling unto the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">year of the jubilee</a>: and counting the money that he was sold for, according to the number of the years and the reckoning of a hired servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> If there be many years that remain until the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">jubilee</a>, according to them shall he also repay the price.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> If few, he shall make the reckoning with him according to the number of the years: and shall repay to the buyer of what remaineth of the years.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> His wages being allowed for which he served before: he shall not afflict him <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> in thy sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And if by these means he cannot be <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">year of the jubilee</a> he shall go out with his children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> For the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span></p>
