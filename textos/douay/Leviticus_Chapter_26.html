<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>. You shall not make to yourselves any <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> or graven thing: neither shall you erect pillars, nor set up a remarkable stone in your land, to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> it. For I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Keep my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">reverence</a> my sanctuary. I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> If you walk in my <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, and keep my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, and do them, I will give you rain in due seasons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the ground shall bring forth its increase: and the trees shall be filled with fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The threshing of your harvest shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land without fear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I will give peace in your coasts: you shall sleep, and there shall be none to make you afraid. I will take away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beasts: and the sword shall not pass through your quarters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> You shall pursue your enemies: and they shall fall before you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Five of yours shall pursue a hundred others: and a hundred of you ten thousand. Your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> I will look on you, and make you increase: you shall be multiplied, and I will establish my covenant with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> You shall eat the oldest of the old store: and, new coming on, you shall cast away the old.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I will set my <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> in the midst of you: and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall not cast you off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I will walk among you, and will be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and you shall be my people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>: who have brought you out of the land of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, that you should not serve them: and who have broken the chains of your necks, that you might go upright.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But if you will not hear me, nor do all my <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> If you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> my <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">laws</a>, and contemn my judgments so as not to do those things which are appointed by me, and to make void my covenant:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I also will do these things to you. I will quickly visit you with poverty, and burning heat, which shall waste your eyes, and consume your lives. You shall sow your seed in vain, which shall be devoured by your enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I will set my face against you, and you shall fall down before your enemies: and shall be made subject to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you. You shall flee when no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pursueth you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But if you will not yet for all this <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me: I will chastise you seven times more for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I will break the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of your stubbornness: and I will make to you the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> above as iron, and the earth as brass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Your labour shall be spent in vain: the ground shall not bring forth her increase: nor the trees yield their fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> If you walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And I will send in upon you the beasts of the field, to destroy you and your cattle, and make you few in number: and that your highways may be desolate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And if even so you will not amend, but will walk contrary to me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> I also will walk contrary to you, and will strike you seven times for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And I will bring in upon you the sword that shall avenge my covenant. And when you shall flee into the cities, I will send the pestilence in the midst of you. And you shall be delivered into the hands of your enemies,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> After I shall have broken the staff of your bread: so that ten <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> shall bake your bread in one oven, and give it out by weight: and you shall eat, and shall not be filled,</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But if you will not for all this hearken to me, but will walk against me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> I will also go against you with opposite fury: and I will chastise you with seven plagues for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So that you shall eat the flesh of your sons and of your daughters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> I will destroy your <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">high places</a>, and break your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. You shall fall among the ruins of your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall abhor you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Insomuch that I will bring your cities to be a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: and I will make your sanctuaries desolate: and will receive no more your sweet odours.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And I will destroy your land: and your enemies shall be astonished at it, when they shall be the inhabitants thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And I will scatter you among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and I will draw out the sword after you. And your land shall be <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and your cities destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Then shall the land enjoy her <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> all the days of her desolation. When you shall be</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> In the enemy's land, she shall keep a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and rest in the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> of her desolation: because she did not rest in your <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, when you dwelt therein.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And as to them that shall remain of you I will send fear in their hearts in the countries of their enemies. The sound of a flying leaf shall terrify them: and they shall flee as it were from the sword. They shall fall, when no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pursueth them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And they shall every one fall upon their brethren as fleeing from wars: none of you shall dare to resist your enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> You shall perish among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and an enemy's land shall consume you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And if of them also some remain, they shall pine away in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, in the land of their enemies: and they shall be afflicted for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their fathers, and their own.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Until they confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> of their ancestors, whereby they have transgressed against me, and walked contrary unto me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Therefore I also will walk against them, and bring them into their enemies' land until their uncircumcised <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be ashamed. Then shall they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And I will remember my covenant, that I made with <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. I will remember also the land:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Which when she shall be left by them, shall enjoy her <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, being desolate for them. But they shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because they rejected my judgments, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> my <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">laws</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And yet for all that when they were in the land of their enemies, I did not cast them off altogether. Neither did I so <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> them that they should be quite consumed: and I should make void my covenant with them. For I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And I will remember my former covenant, when I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to be their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. These are the judgments, and precepts, and <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">laws</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave between him and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount Sinai</a>, by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></p>
