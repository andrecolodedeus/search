<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Take <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> with his sons, their <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, and the oil of unction: a calf for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, two rams, a basket with <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened bread</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou shalt gather together all the congregation to the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded. And all the multitude being gathered together before the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He said: This is the word that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath commanded to be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And immediately, he offered <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons. And when he had washed them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vested</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> with the strait linen garment, girding him with the girdle, and putting on him the violet <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunick</a>: and over it he put the <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">ephod</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And binding it with the girdle, he fitted it to the <a href="../cathen/11600b.htm">rational</a>, on which was <a href="../cathen/15224a.htm">Doctrine and Truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He put also the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> upon his head: and upon the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> over the forehead, he put the plate of gold, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctification</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He took also the oil of unction, with which he anointed the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, with all the furniture thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when he had <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> and sprinkled the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> seven times, he anointed it, and all the vessels thereof: and the laver with the foot thereof, he <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> with the oil.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he poured it upon <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> head: and he anointed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And after he had offered his sons, he <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vested</a> them with linen <a href="../cathen/15087a.htm">tunicks</a>, and girded them with girdles: and put <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitres</a> on them as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He offered also the calf for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and when <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons had <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">put their hands</a> upon the head thereof,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He immolated it: and took the blood, and dipping his finger in it, he touched the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horns of the altar</a> round about. Which being expiated, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>, he poured the rest of the blood at the bottom thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But the fat that was upon the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two little kidneys, with their fat, he burnt upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the calf with the skin, and the flesh and the dung, he burnt without the camp, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He offered also a ram for <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>. And when <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons had <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">put their hands</a> upon its head:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He immolated it, and poured the blood thereof round about the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And cutting the ram into pieces, the head thereof, and the joints, and the fat he burnt in the fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Having first washed the entrails, and the feet, and the whole ram together he burnt upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: because it was a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> of most sweet odour to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as he had commanded him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He offered also the second ram, in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and his sons <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">put their hands</a> upon the head thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had immolated it, he took of the blood thereof, and touched the tip of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> right ear, and the thumb of his right hand, and in like manner also the great toe of his right foot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He offered also the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: and when with the blood of the ram that was immolated, he had touched the tip of the right ear of every one of them, and the thumbs of their right hands, and the great toes of their right feet, the rest he poured on the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that covereth the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and with the right shoulder, he separated.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And taking out of the basket of <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unleavened bread</a>, which was before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">loaf without leaven</a>, and a cake tempered with oil and a wafer, he put them upon the fat, and the right shoulder:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Delivering all to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and to his sons. Who having lifted them up before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> He took them again from their hands, and burnt them upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm#Ia">altar of holocaust</a>: because it was the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, for a sweet odour of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he took of the ram of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the breast for his portion, elevating it before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And taking the <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>, and the blood that was upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, he sprinkled <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, and his sons, and their <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> with it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when he had <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> them in their <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, he commanded them, saying: Boil the flesh before the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and there eat it. Eat ye also the loaves of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, that are laid in the basket, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> commanded me, saying: <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons shall eat them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And whatsoever shall be left of the flesh and the loaves, shall be consumed with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And you shall not go out of the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> for seven days, until the day wherein the time of your <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> shall be expired. For in seven days the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is finished:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> As at this present it hath been done, that the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">rite</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> might be accomplished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Day and night shall you remain in the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> observing the watches of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, lest you die. For so it hath been commanded me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons did all things which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></p>
