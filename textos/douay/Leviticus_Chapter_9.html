<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when the eighth day was come, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> called <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his sons, and the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Take of the herd a calf for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and a ram for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, both without blemish, and offer them before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> thou shalt say: Take ye a he goat for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and a calf, and a lamb, both of a year old, and without blemish for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Also a bullock and a ram for peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>. And immolate them before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of every one of them flour tempered with oil: for to day the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will appear to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> They brought therefore all things that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had commanded before the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>: where when all the multitude stood,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: This is the word, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath commanded. Do it, and his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will appear to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: Approach to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, and offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And forthwith <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, approaching to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, immolated the calf for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And his sons brought him the blood of it: and he dipped his finger therein, and touched the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">horns of the altar</a>, and poured the rest at the foot thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the fat, and the little kidneys, and the caul of the liver, which are for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he burnt upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But the flesh and skins thereof he burnt with fire without the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He immolated also the victim of <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>: and his sons brought him the blood thereof, which he poured round about on the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the victim being cut into pieces, they brought to him the head and all the members: all which he burnt with fire upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Having first washed the entrails and the feet with water.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the people, he slew the he goat: and expiating the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He offered the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Adding in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the libations, which are offered withal, and burning them upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of the morning <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He immolated also the bullock and the ram, and peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> of the people: and his sons brought him the blood, which he poured upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The fat also of the bullock, and the rump of the ram, and the two little kidneys with their fat, and the caul of the liver,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> They put upon the breasts. And after the fat was burnt upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> separated their breasts, and the right shoulders, elevating them before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had commanded.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And stretching forth his hands to the people, he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them. And so the victims for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and the peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> being finished, he came down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> went into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the testimony</a>, and afterwards came forth and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the people. And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared to all the multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And, behold, a fire, coming forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, devoured the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>, and the fat that was upon the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>: which when the multitude saw, they praised the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, falling on their faces.</span></p>
