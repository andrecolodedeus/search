<div class="h1a">Christ sends forth and instructs his seventy-two disciples. The good Samaritan.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after these things, the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> appointed also other seventy-two. And he sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself was to come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said to them: The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> ye therefore the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> of the harvest that he send labourers into his harvest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Go: Behold I send you as lambs among wolves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Into whatever house you enter, first say: Peace be to this house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall return to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And in the same house, remain, eating and drinking such things as they have: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Remove not from house to house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And into what city soever you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And heal the sick that are therein and say to them: The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is come nigh unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But into whatsoever city you enter, and they receive you not, going forth into the streets thereof, say:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Even the very dust of your city that cleaveth to us, we wipe off against you. Yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I say to you, it shall be more tolerable at that day for <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> than for that city.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Woe to thee, Corozain! Woe to thee, <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a>! For if in <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a> had been wrought the mighty works that have been wrought in you, they would have done <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> long ago, sitting in <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a> and ashes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But it shall be more tolerable for <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a> at the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> than for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And thou, <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, which art exalted unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, thou shalt be thrust down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He that heareth you heareth me: and he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> me: and he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> me <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despiseth</a> him that sent me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the seventy-two returned with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> also are subject to us in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said to them: I saw <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> like lightning falling from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall hurt you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But yet rejoice not in this, that spirits are subject unto you: but rejoice in this, that your <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> are written in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> In that same hour, he rejoiced in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and said: I confess to thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and hast revealed them to little ones. Yea, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for so it hath seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in thy sight. <span class="stiki"><strong>He rejoiced in the Holy Ghost...</strong> That is, according to his humanity he rejoiced in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and gave thanks to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">eternal Father</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> All things are delivered to me by my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. And no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> who the Son is, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>: and who the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> is, but the Son and to whom the Son will reveal him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And turning to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> are the eyes that see the things which you see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For I say to you that many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and kings have desired to see the things that you see and have not seen them; and to hear the things that you hear and have not heard them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him and saying, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, what must I do to possess <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But he said to him: What is written in the law? How readest thou?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He answering, said: Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart and with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and with all thy strength and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thyself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he said to him: Thou hast answered right. This do: and thou shalt live.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But he willing to justify himself, said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: And who is my neighbour?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said: A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went down from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> and fell among robbers, who also stripped him and having wounded him went away, leaving him half dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And it chanced, that a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> went down the same way: and seeing him, passed by.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> In like manner also a <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, when he was near the place and saw him, passed by.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But a certain <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, being on his journey, came near him: and seeing him, was moved with compassion:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And going up to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn and took care of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the next day he took out two pence and gave to the host and said: Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my return, will repay thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Which of these three, in thy opinion, was neighbour to him that fell among the robbers?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But he said: He that showed <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">mercy</a> to him. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Go, and do thou in like manner.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain town: and a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> received him into her house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And she had a sister called <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>-->, who, sitting also at the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord's<!--</a>--> feet, heard his word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a> was busy about much serving. Who stood and said: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, hast thou no care that my sister hath left me alone to serve? Speak to her therefore, that she help me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> answering, said to her: <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a>, <a href="../cathen/09721b.htm">Martha</a>, thou art careful and art troubled about many things:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> But one thing is necessary. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> hath chosen the best part, which shall not be taken away from her.</span></p>
