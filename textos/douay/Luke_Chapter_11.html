<h1>Luke Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ teaches his disciples to pray. He casts out a dumb devil, confutes the Pharisees, and pronounces woes against them for their hypocrisy.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass that as he was in a certain place <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, when he ceased, one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, teach us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> also taught his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said to them: When you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, say: <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Father</a>, hallowed be thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>. Thy kingdom come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Give us this day our daily bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend and shall go to him at midnight and shall say to him: Friend, lend me three loaves,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me and I have not what to set before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he from within should answer and say: Trouble me not; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot rise and give thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Yet if he shall continue knocking, I say to you, although he will not rise and give him because he is his friend; yet, because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I say to you: Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For every one that asketh receiveth: and he that seeketh findeth: and to him that knocketh it shall be opened:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And which of you, if he ask his father bread, will he give him a stone? Or a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Or if he shall ask an egg, will he reach him a scorpion?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> If you then, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> gifts to your children, how much more will your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">good Spirit</a> to them that ask him?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he was casting out a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: and the same was dumb. And when he had <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes, were in admiration at it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But some of them said: He casteth out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the prince of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And others tempting, asked of him a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">sign from heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But he seeing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself shall be brought to desolation; and house upon house shall fall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And if <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? Because you say that through <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> I <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now if I <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, by whom do your children <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast them out</a>? Therefore, they shall be your <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judges<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But if I by the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, doubtless the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is come upon you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> When a strong <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> armed keepeth his <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>, those things are in peace which he possesseth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But if a stronger than he come upon him and overcome him, he will take away all his armour wherein he trusted and will distribute his spoils.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> When the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a> is gone out of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he walketh through places without water, seeking rest: and not finding, he saith: I will return into my house whence I came out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than himself: and entering in they dwell there. And the last state of that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> becomes worse than the first.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is the womb that bore thee and the paps that gave thee suck.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But he said: Yea rather, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> are they who hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a> and keep it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And the multitudes running together, he began to say: This <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>. It asketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>--> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For as <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>--> was a sign to the Ninivites; so shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> also be to this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> The queen of the <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">south</a> shall rise in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> and shall condemn them: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>. And behold more than <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Ninive shall rise in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> with this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> and shall condemn it; Because they did <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> at the preaching of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>-->. And behold more than <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Jonas<!--</a>--> here.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> lighteth a candle and putteth it in a hidden place, nor under a bushel: but upon a candlestick, that they that come in may see the light.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> The light of thy body is thy eye. If thy eye be single, thy whole body will be lightsome: but if it be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, thy body also will be darksome.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> If then thy whole body be lightsome, having no part of darkness: the whole shall be lightsome and, as a bright lamp, shall enlighten thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And as he was speaking, a certain <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> him that he would dine with him. And he going in, sat down to eat.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> began to say, thinking within himself, why he was not <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed</a> before dinner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said to him: Now you, <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter: but your inside is full of rapine and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make also that which is within?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But yet that which remaineth, give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>: and behold, all things are clean unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> But woe to you, <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, because you <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> mint and rue and every herb and pass over <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now these things you ought to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Woe to you, <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, because you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the uppermost seats in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and salutations in the marketplace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Woe to you, because you are as sepulchres that appear not: and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that walk over are not aware.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And one of the lawyers answering, saith to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, in saying these things, thou reproachest us also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> But he said: Woe to you lawyers also, because you load <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with burdens which they cannot bear and you yourselves touch not the packs with one of your fingers. <span class="stiki"><strong>Woe to you lawyers...</strong> He speaks of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, commonly called the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Woe to you who build the monuments of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and your fathers killed them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Woe to you who build, etc...</strong> Not that the building of the monuments of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was in itself blameworthy, but only the intention of these unhappy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who made use of this outward show of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->religion<!--</a>--> and piety, as a means to carry on their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> designs against the prince of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Truly you bear witness that you consent to the doings of your fathers. For they indeed killed them: and you build their sepulchres.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> For this cause also the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said: I will send to them <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: and some of them they will kill and persecute.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> That the blood of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> From the blood of <a href="../cathen/01035c.htm">Abel</a> unto the blood of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Zacharias<!--</a>-->, who was slain between the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>. Yea I say to you: It shall be required of this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Woe to you lawyers, for you have taken away the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. You yourselves have not entered in: and those that were entering in, you have hindered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And as he was saying these things to them, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the lawyers began <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> to urge him and to oppress his mouth about many things,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Lying in wait for him and seeking to catch something from his mouth, that they might accuse him.</span></p>
