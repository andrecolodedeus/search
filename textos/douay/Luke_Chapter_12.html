<h1>Luke Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ warns us against hypocrisy, the fear of the world and covetousness. He admonishes all to watch.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when great multitudes stood about him, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Beware ye of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed: nor hidden that shall not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For whatsoever things you have spoken in darkness shall be published in the light: and that which you have spoken in the ear in the chambers shall be preached on the housetops.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I say to you, my friends: Be not afraid of them who <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill the body</a> and after that have no more that they can do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But I will show you whom you shall fear: Fear ye him who, after he hath killed, hath power to cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Yea, I say to you: Fear him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Yea, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I say to you: Whosoever shall confess me before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, him shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> also confess before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But he that shall deny me before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall be denied before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And whosoever speaketh a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when they shall bring you into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and to magistrates and powers, be not solicitous how or what you shall answer, or what you shall say.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall teach you in the same hour what you must say.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And one of the multitude said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But he said to him: Man, who hath appointed me <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> or divider over you?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to them: Take heed and beware of all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life doth not consist in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->abundance<!--</a>--> of things which he possesseth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he spoke a similitude to them, saying: The land of a certain rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> brought forth plenty of fruits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he thought within himself, saying: What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he said: This will I do: I will pull down my barns and will build greater: and into them will I gather all things that are grown to me and my goods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I will say to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years. Take thy rest: eat, drink, make <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> cheer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to him: Thou fool, this night do they require thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of thee. And whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> So is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Therefore I say to you: Be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The life is more than the meat: and the body is more than the raiment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Consider the ravens, for they sow not, neither do they reap, neither have they storehouse nor barn, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> feedeth them. How much are you more valuable than they?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> If then ye be not able to do so much as the least thing, why are you solicitous for the rest?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Consider the lilies, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin. But I say to you, not even <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> in all his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was clothed like one of these.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Now, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> clothe in this manner the grass that is to-day in the field and to-morrow is cast into the oven: how much more you, O ye of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And seek not what you shall eat or what you shall drink: and be not lifted up on high.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For all these things do the nations of the world seek. But your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> that you have need of these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But seek ye first the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and all these things shall be added unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Fear not, little flock, for it hath pleased your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> to give you a kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Sell what you possess and give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Make to yourselves bags which grow not old, a treasure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> which faileth not: where no <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> approacheth, nor moth corrupteth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Let your loins be girt and lamps burning in your hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And you yourselves like to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who wait for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> are those servants whom the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, when he cometh, shall find watching. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you that he will gird himself and make them sit down to meat and passing will minister unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> are those servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye, that if the householder did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at what hour the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> would come, he would surely watch and would not suffer his house to be broken open.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Be you then also ready: for at what hour you think not the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> will come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, dost thou speak this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to us, or likewise to all?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said: Who thinkest thou is the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> and wise steward, whom his lord setteth over his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to give them their measure of wheat in due season?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is that servant whom, when his lord shall come, he shall find so doing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Verily I say to you, he will set him over all that he possesseth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> But if that servant shall say in his heart: My <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> is long a coming; and shall begin to strike the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>-servants and maid-servants, and to eat and to drink and be drunk:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> The lord of that servant will come in the day that he <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hopeth</a> not, and at the hour that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not: and shall separate him and shall appoint him his portion with unbelievers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And that servant, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his lord and prepared not himself and did not according to his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, shall be beaten with many stripes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> But he that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">knew not</a> and did things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes. And unto whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required: and to whom they have committed much, of him they will demand the more.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> I am come to cast fire on the earth. And what will I, but that it be kindled?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And I have a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherewith I am to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. And how am I straitened until it be accomplished?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> Think ye, that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, no; but separation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> For there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided: three against two, and two against three.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> The father shall be divided against the son and the son against his father: the mother against the daughter and the daughter against her mother: the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And he said also to the multitudes: When you see a cloud <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> from the west, presently you say: A shower is coming. And so it happeneth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And when ye see the south wind blow, you say: There will heat. And it cometh to pass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> You <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to discern the face of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and of the earth: but how is it that you do not discern this time?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And why, even of yourselves, do you not <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> that which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And when thou goest with thy adversary to the prince, whilst thou art in the way, endeavour to be delivered from him: lest perhaps he draw thee to be <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>-->, and the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> deliver thee to the exacter, and the exacter cast thee into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> I say to thee, thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last mite.</span></p>
