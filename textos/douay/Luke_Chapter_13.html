<div class="h1a">The necessity of penance. The barren fig tree. The cure of the infirm woman. The journey to Jerusalem.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And there were present, at that very time, some that told him of the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galileans</a>, whose blood <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had mingled with their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he answering, said to them: Think you that these <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galileans</a> were sinners above all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, because they suffered such things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> No, I say to you: but unless you shall do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, you shall all likewise perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Or those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in <a href="../cathen/13792a.htm">Siloe</a> and slew them: think you that they also were debtors above all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> No, I say to you: but except you do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, you shall all likewise perish.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He spoke also this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>: A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had a fig tree planted in his vineyard: and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he said to the dresser of the vineyard: Behold, for these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and I find none. Cut it down therefore. Why cumbereth it the ground?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But he answering, said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, let it alone this year also, until I dig about it and dung it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And if happily it bear fruit: but if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he was teaching in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> on their <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And behold there was a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had a <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirit<!--</a>--> of infirmity eighteen years. And she was bowed together: neither could she look upwards at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Whom when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saw, he called her unto him and said to her: <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a>, thou art delivered from thy infirmity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laid his hands</a> upon her: and immediately she was made straight and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had healed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> answering, said to the multitude: Six days there are wherein you ought to work. In them therefore come and be healed: and not on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> answering him, said: Ye <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>, doth not every one of you, on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>, loose his ox or his ass from the manger and lead them to water?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And ought not this daughter of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the things that were <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> done by him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He said therefore: To what is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> like, and whereunto shall I resemble it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> It is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> took and cast into his garden: and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in the branches thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And again he said: Whereunto shall I esteem the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> to be like?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> It is like to leaven, which a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he went through the cities and towns teaching and making his journey to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, are they few that are saved? But he said to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Strive to enter by the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, shall seek to enter and shall not be able. <span class="stiki"><strong>Shall seek, etc...</strong> Shall desire to be saved; but for want of taking sufficient pains, and being thoroughly in earnest, shall not attain to it.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But when the master of the house shall be gone in and shall shut the door, you shall begin to stand without; and knock at the door, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, open to us. And he answering, shall say to you: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not, whence you are.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then you shall begin to say: We have eaten and drunk in thy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>-->: and thou hast taught in our streets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he shall say to you: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not, whence you are. Depart from me, all ye workers of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth; when you shall see <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>: and you yourselves thrust out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And there shall come from the east and the west and the north and the south: and shall sit down in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And behold, they are last that shall be first: and they are first that shall be last.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> The same day, there came some of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, saying to him: Depart, and get thee hence, for <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> hath a mind to kill thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he said to them: Go and tell that fox: Behold, I <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> and do cures, to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am consummated.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Nevertheless, I must walk to-day and to-morrow and the day following, because it cannot be that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> perish, out of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, that killest the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stonest</a> them that are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children as the bird doth her brood under her wings, and thou wouldest not?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Behold your house shall be left to you desolate. And I say to you that you shall not see me till the time come when you shall say: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is he that cometh in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of the Lord</a>.</span></p>
