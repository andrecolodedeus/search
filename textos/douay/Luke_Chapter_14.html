<div class="h1a">Christ heals the dropsical man. The parable of the supper. The necessity of renouncing all to follow Christ.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went into the house of one of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>, that they watched him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And behold, there was a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> before him that had the dropsy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, spoke to the lawyers and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But they held their peace. But he taking him, healed him and sent him away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And answering them, he said: Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit and will not immediately draw him out, on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And they could not answer him to these things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he spoke a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> also to them that were invited, marking how they chose the first seats at the table, saying to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not down in the first place, lest perhaps one more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> than thou be invited by him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he that invited thee and him, come and say to thee: Give this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> place. And then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place; that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee: Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> before them that sit at table with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Because every one that exalteth himself shall be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>: and he that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbleth</a> himself shall be exalted.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he said to him also that had invited him: When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsmen</a> nor thy neighbours who are rich; lest perhaps they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And thou shalt be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, because they have not wherewith to make thee recompense: for recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> When one of them that sat at table with him had heard these things, he said to him: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is he that shall eat bread in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But he said to him: A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> made a great supper and invited many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited, that they should come: for now all things are ready.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him: I have bought a farm and I must needs go out and see it. I pray thee, hold me excused.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to try them. I pray thee, hold me excused.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And another said: I have <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> a wife; and therefore I cannot come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the servant returning, told these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city; and bring in hither the poor and the feeble and the blind and the lame.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the servant said: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, it is done as thou hast commanded; and yet there is room.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But I say unto you that none of those <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were invited shall taste of my supper.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And there went great multitudes with him. And turning, he said to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> come to me, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hate not, etc...</strong> The law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> does not allow us to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> even our enemies, much less our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>: but the meaning of the text is, that we must be in that disposition of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as to be willing to renounce, and part with every thing, how near or dear soever it may be to us, that would keep us from following <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For which of you, having a mind to build a tower, doth not first sit down and reckon the charges that are necessary, whether he have wherewithal to finish it:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Lest, after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it, all that see it begin to mock him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Saying: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> began to build and was not able to finish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Or, what king, about to go to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against another king, doth not first sit down and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Or else, while the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth conditions of peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">Salt</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> It is neither profitable for the land nor for the dunghill: but shall be cast out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></p>
