<div class="h1a">The parables of the lost sheep and of the prodigal son.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> murmured, saying: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> receiveth sinners and eateth with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he spoke to them this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of you that hath an hundred sheep, and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and go after that which was lost, until he find it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> I say to you that even so there shall be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> upon one sinner that doth <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, more than upon ninety-nine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> who need not <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Or what <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> having ten <a href="../cathen/05152b.htm">groats</a>, if she lose one <a href="../cathen/05152b.htm">groat</a>, doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the <a href="../cathen/05152b.htm">groat</a> which I had lost.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> So I say to you, there shall be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels of God</a> upon one sinner doing <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Before the angels...</strong> By this it is plain that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">spirits in heaven</a> have a concern for us below, and a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at our repentance and consequently a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said: A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had two sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the younger of them said to his father: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Father<!--</a>-->, give me the portion of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->substance<!--</a>--> that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->substance<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->substance<!--</a>-->, living riotously.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country: and he began to be in want.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gave unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> I will arise and will go to my father and say to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Father<!--</a>-->, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and before thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up, he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion and running to him fell upon his neck and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the son said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Father<!--</a>-->: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and before thee I am not now worthy to be called thy son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe and put it on him: and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it: and let us eat and make merry:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Because this my son was dead and is come to life again, was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Now his elder son was in the field and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dancing</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he said to him: Thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee and I have never transgressed thy commandment: and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->substance<!--</a>--> with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me; and all I have is thine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.</span></p>
