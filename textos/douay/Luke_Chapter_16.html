<h1>Luke Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">The parable of the unjust steward and of the rich man and Lazarus.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he said also to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: There was a certain rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he called him and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Therefore, calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill and write eighty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the lord commended the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> than the children of light.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>: that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings. <span class="stiki"><strong>Mammon of iniquity...</strong> <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">Mammon</a> signifies riches. They are here called the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, because oftentimes ill gotten, ill bestowed, or an <a href="../cathen/11196a.htm">occasion of evil</a>; and at the best are but worldly, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; and not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches of a Christian. <strong>They may receive...</strong> By this we see, that the poor servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom we have relieved by our <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, may hereafter, by their intercession, bring our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He that is <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> in that which is least is <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> also in that which is greater: and he that is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> in that which is little is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> also in that which is greater.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If then you have not been <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> in the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, who will trust you with that which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And if you have not been <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> No servant can serve two masters: for either he will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the one and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the other: or he will hold to the one and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> the other. You cannot serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who were <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, heard all these things: and they derided him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to them: you are they who justify yourselves before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> your hearts. For that which is high to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is an abomination before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> The law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were until <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>. From that time the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is preached: and every one useth <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> towards it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And it is easier for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> There was a certain <a href="../cathen/05048a.htm">rich man</a> who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And there was a certain beggar, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, who lay at his gate, full of sores,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the <a href="../cathen/05048a.htm">rich man's</a> table. And no one did give him: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">Abraham's bosom</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/05048a.htm">rich man</a> also died: and he was <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->buried<!--</a>--> in hell. <span class="stiki"><strong>Abraham's bosom...</strong> The place of rest, where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> resided, till <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had opened <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> by his death.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> afar off and <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> in his <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">bosom</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he cried and said: <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Father Abraham</a>, have mercy on me and send <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in thy lifetime, and likewise <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things: but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot, nor from thence come hither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee that thou wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> said to him: They have <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Let them hear them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But he said: No, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">father Abraham</a>: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he said to him: If they hear not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, neither will they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, if one <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a> from the dead.</span></p>
