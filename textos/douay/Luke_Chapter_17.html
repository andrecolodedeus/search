<h1>Luke Chapter 17</h1>
<div class="h1a">Lessons of avoiding scandal and of the efficacy of faith. The ten lepers. The manner of the coming of Christ.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: It is impossible that <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> should not come. But woe to him through whom they come!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea, than that he should <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> one of these little ones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against thee, reprove him: and if he do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, forgive him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And if he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> unto thee, saying: I repent: forgive him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> said to the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->: Increase our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said: If you had <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree: Be thou rooted up and be thou transplanted into the sea. And it would <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go. Sit down to meat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper and gird thyself and serve me, whilst I eat and drink; and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Doth he thank that servant for doing the things which he commanded him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do. <span class="stiki"><strong>Unprofitable servants...</strong> Because our service is of no profit to our master; and he <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> claims it as our bounden <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. But though we are unprofitable to him, our serving him is not unprofitable to us; for he is pleased to give by his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a value to our good works, which, in consequence of his <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, entitles them to an eternal reward.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it came to pass, as he was going to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he passed through the midst of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, who stood afar off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And lifted up their voice, saying: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, have mercy on us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Whom when he saw, he said: Go, show yourselves to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorifying</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks. And this was a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said: Were not ten made clean? And where are the nine?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> There is no one found to return and give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but this stranger.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> hath made thee whole.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And being asked by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> when the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> should come, he answering them and said: The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> cometh not with observation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is within you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: The days will come when you shall desire to see one day of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. And you shall not see it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For as the lightning that lighteneth from under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shineth unto the parts that are under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, so shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be in his day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And as it came to pass in the days of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a>, so shall it be also in the days of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> They did eat and drink, they <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> wives and were given in <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>, until the day that <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> entered into the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">flood</a> came and destroyed them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Likewise as it came to pass in the days of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>. They did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And in the day that <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> went out of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, it rained fire and brimstone from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and destroyed them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Even thus shall it be in the day when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be revealed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Remember <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> I say to you: In that night there shall be two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in one bed. The one shall be taken and the other shall be left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> shall be grinding together. The one shall be taken and the other shall be left. Two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall be in the field. The one shall be taken and the other shall be left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> They answering, say to him: Where, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.</span></p>
