<h1>Luke Chapter 18</h1>
<div class="h1a">We must pray always. The Pharisee and the publican. The danger of riches. The blind man is restored to sight.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he spoke also a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to them, that we ought always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and not to faint,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Saying: There was a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> in a certain city, who feared not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor regarded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And there was a certain <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in that city; and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary. <span class="stiki"><strong>Avenge...</strong> That is, do me <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. It is a Hebraism.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor regard <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Yet because this <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said: Hear what the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> saith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And will not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revenge his <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> who cry to him day and night? And will he have patience in their regard?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> I say to you that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on earth?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And to some who trusted in themselves as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> others, he spoke also this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> went up into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: the one a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> and the other a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> standing, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> thus with himself: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, extortioners, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulterers</a>, as also is this <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I fast twice in a week: I give <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all that I possess.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; but <a href="../cathen/02751a.htm">struck his breast</a>, saying: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be merciful to me a sinner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I say to you, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went down into his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself shall be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>: and he that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbleth</a> himself shall be exalted.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> saw, they rebuked them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me and forbid them not: for of such is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> as a child shall not enter into it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And a certain ruler asked him, saying: <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a> master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Why dost thou call me <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> the commandments: Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness: <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">Honour</a> thy father and mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee. Sell all whatever thou hast and give to the poor: and thou shalt have treasure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. And come, follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> He having heard these things, became sorrowful: for he was very rich.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they that heard it said: Who then can be saved?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He said to them: The things that are impossible with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are possible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said: Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Who said to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, I say to you, there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that hath left home or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or brethren or wife or children, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God's</a> sake,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> took unto him the twelve and said to them: Behold, we go up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> For he shall be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and shall be mocked and scourged and spit upon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death. And the third day he shall <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them: and they understood not the things that were said.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, that a certain blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sat by the way side, begging.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And they told him that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> was passing by.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he cried out, saying: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>, have mercy on me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>, have mercy on me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Saying; What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, that I may see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Receive thy sight: thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> hath made thee whole.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And immediately he saw and followed him, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorifying</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
