<div class="h1a">Zacheus entertains Christ. The parable of the pounds. Christ rides upon an ass and weeps over Jerusalem.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And entering he walked through <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And behold, there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Zacheus, who was the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>: and he was rich.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he sought to see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who he was: and he could not for the crowd, because he was low of stature.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him: for he was to pass that way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was come to the place, looking up, he saw him and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down: for this day I must abide in thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he made haste and came down and received him with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that was a sinner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But Zacheus standing, said to the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->: Behold, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of any thing, I restore him fourfold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: This day is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> come to this house, because he also is a son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, because he was nigh to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and because they thought that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> should immediately be manifested.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> He said therefore: a certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds and said to them: Trade till I come. <span class="stiki"><strong>He gave them ten pounds...</strong> In the original, what is here translated a pound, is in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->mina<!--</a>-->, in value of our coin, three pounds two shillings and sixpence.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But his citizens <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to reign over us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it came to pass that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had gained by trading,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the first came saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said to him: Well done, thou <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> servant, because thou hast been <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the second came, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he said to him: Be thou also over five cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And another came, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For I feared thee, because thou art an austere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down: and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> thee, thou <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servant. Thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knewest</a> that I was an austere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, taking up what I laid not down and reaping that which I did not sow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have exacted it with <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, he hath ten pounds.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But I say to you that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither and kill them before me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And having said these things, he went before, going up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a>, unto the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount called Olivet</a>, he sent two of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> ever hath sitten: loose him and bring him hither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall ask you: Why do you loose him? You shall say thus unto him: Because the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> hath need of his service.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they that were sent went their way and found the colt standing, as he said unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But they said: Because the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> hath need of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And they brought him to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. And casting their garments on the colt, they set <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> thereon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And when he was now coming near the descent of <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount Olivet</a>, the whole multitude of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> began with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Saying: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the king who cometh in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of the Lord</a>! Peace in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on high!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And some of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, from amongst the multitude, said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, rebuke thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> To whom he said: I say to you that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> If thou also hadst <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace: but now they are hidden from thy eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> For the days shall come upon thee: and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and straiten thee on every side,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee. And they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the time of thy visitation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And entering into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, he began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. But you have made it a den of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thieves</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And he was teaching daily in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>. And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</span></p>
