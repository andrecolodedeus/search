<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> This enrolling was first made by <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Cyrinus<!--</a>-->, the governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> also went up from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, out of the city of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, to the city of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, which is called <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>: because he was of the house and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to them: Fear not; for, behold, I bring you <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tidings of great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that shall be to all the people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For, this day is born to you a Saviour, who is <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ the Lord</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">city of David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And suddenly there was with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> a multitude of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> army, praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and saying:</span></p>
