<div class="h1a">The parable of the husbandmen. Of paying tribute to Caesar and of the resurrection of the dead.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass that on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, with the ancients, met together,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And spoke to him, saying: Tell us, by what authority dost thou these things? Or, who is he that hath given thee this authority?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: I will also ask you one thing. Answer me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, was it from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But they thought within themselves, saying: If we shall say, From <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: he will say: Why then did you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But if we say, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: the whole people will <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> us. For they are persuaded that <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they answered that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not whence it was.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he began to speak to the people this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>: A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen: and he was abroad for a long time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. Who, beating him, sent him away empty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And again he sent another servant. But they beat him also and, treating him reproachfully, sent him away empty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also and cast him out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then the lord of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be, when they see him, they will reverence him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Whom, when the husbandmen saw, they thought within themselves, saying: This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He will come and will destroy these husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others. Which they hearing, said to him: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But he looking on them, said: What is this then that is written, The stone, which the builders rejected, the same is become the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">head of the corner</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be bruised: and upon whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> sought to lay hands on him the same hour: but they feared the people, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he spoke this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And being upon the watch, they sent spies, who should feign themselves <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, that they might take hold of him in his words, that they might deliver him up to the authority and power of the governor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they asked him, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou speakest and teachest rightly: and thou dost not respect any person, but teachest the way of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Is it lawful for us to give tribute to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>, or no?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he, considering their guile, said to them: Why <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> you me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Show me a penny. Whose image and inscription hath it? They answering, said to him: <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he said to them: Render therefore to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a> the things, that are <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a>: and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the things that are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they could not reprehend his word before the people: and wondering at his answer, they held their peace.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And there came to him some of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who deny that there is any resurrection: and they asked him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote unto us: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> brother die, having a wife, and he leave no children, that his brother should take her to wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife and died without children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the next took her to wife: and he also died childless.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the third took her. And in like manner, all the seven: and they left no children and died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Last of all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> died also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> In the resurrection therefore, whose wife of them shall she be? For all the seven had her to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: The children of this world <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> and are given in <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But they that shall be accounted worthy of that world and of the resurrection from the dead shall neither be <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> nor take wives.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Neither can they die any more for they are equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and are the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">children of God</a>, being the children of the resurrection.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Now that the dead <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also showed at the bush, when he called the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> For he is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And some of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> answering, said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, thou hast said well.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And after that they durst not ask him any more questions.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But he said to them: How say they that <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> is the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> himself saith in the book of Psalms: The <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said to my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, sit thou on my right hand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> then calleth him <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->. And how is he his son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Beware of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, who desire to walk in long robes and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> salutations in the market place and the first chairs in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and the chief rooms at feasts:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Who devour the houses of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, feigning long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. These shall receive greater damnation.</span></p>
