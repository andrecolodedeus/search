<div class="h1a">The widow's mites. The signs that should forerun the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And looking on, he saw the rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> cast their gifts into the treasury.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he saw also a certain poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> casting in two brass mites.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said: Verily, I say to you that this poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> hath cast in more than they all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For all these have of their <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->abundance<!--</a>--> cast into the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but she of her want hath cast in all the living that she had.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And some saying of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> that it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> These things which you see, the days will come in which there shall not be left a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they asked him, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign when they shall begin to come to pass?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Who said: Take heed you be not seduced: for many will come in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, saying: I am he and the time is at hand. Go ye not therefore after them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when you shall hear of wars and seditions, be not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">terrified</a>. These things must first come to pass: but the end is not yet presently.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then he said to them: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Nation<!--</a>--> shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And there shall be great earthquakes in divers places and pestilences and famines and terrors from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and there shall be great signs.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and into prisons, dragging you before kings and governors, for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And it shall happen unto you for a testimony.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Lay it up therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before how you shall answer:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist and gainsay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And you shall be betrayed by your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and brethren and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kinsmen</a> and friends: and some of you they will <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And you shall be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But a hair of your head shall not perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> In your patience you shall possess your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when you shall see <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> compassed about with an army, then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the desolation thereof is at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then let those who are in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> flee to the mountains: and those who are in the midst thereof depart out: and those who are in the countries not enter into it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For these are the days of vengeance, that all things may be fulfilled, that are written.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But woe to them that are with child and give suck in those days: for there shall be great distress in the land and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon this people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captives into all nations: and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> shall be trodden down by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> till the times of the nations be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of the confusion of the roaring of the sea, and of the waves:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Men withering away for fear and expectation of what shall come upon the whole world. For the powers of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shall be moved.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And then they shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in a cloud, with great power and majesty.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But when these things begin to come to pass, look up and lift up your heads, because your <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> is at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he spoke to them a similitude. See the fig tree and all the trees:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> When they now shoot forth their fruit, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that summer is nigh;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So you also, when you shall see these things come to pass, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, I say to you, this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life: and that day come upon you suddenly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> For as a snare shall it come upon all that sit upon the face of the whole earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Watch ye, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at all times, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are to come and to stand before the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And in the daytime, he was teaching in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: but at night going out, he abode in the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount that is called Olivet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And all the people came early in the morning to him in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, to hear him.</span></p>
