<div class="h1a">The treason of Judas. The last supper. The first part of the history of the passion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of unleavened bread</a>, which is called the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, was at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> sought how they might put <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to death: but they feared the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> entered into <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot</a>, one of the twelve.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he went and discoursed with the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they were glad and covenanted to give him money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">unleavened bread</a> came, on which it was necessary that the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a> should be killed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he sent <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, saying: Go, and prepare for us the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>, that we may eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee: Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a> with my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he will show you a large dining room, furnished. And there prepare.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they going, found as he had said to them and made ready the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when the hour was come, he sat down: and the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a> with you, before I suffer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For I say to you that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks and said: Take and divide it among you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For I say to you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> come.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And taking bread, he gave thanks and brake and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me. <span class="stiki"><strong>Do this for a commemoration of me...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and sacrament is to be continued in the church, to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>, to show forth the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">death of Christ</a>, until he cometh. But this commemoration, or remembrance, is by no means inconsistent with the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">real presence of his body and blood</a>, under these <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->sacramental<!--</a>--> veils, which represent his death; on the contrary, it is the manner that he himself hath commanded, of commemorating and celebrating his death, by <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and receiving in the sacrament, that body and blood by which we were <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeemed</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> In like manner, the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But yet behold: the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by whom he shall be betrayed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he said to them: The kings of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> lord it over them; and they that have power over them are called beneficent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger: and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For which is greater, he that sitteth at table or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And you are they who have continued with me in my <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And I dispose to you, as my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> hath disposed to me, a kingdom;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judging<!--</a>--> the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">twelve tribes of Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said: <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a>, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a>, behold <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for thee, that thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not: and thou, being once <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, confirm thy brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Who said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, I am ready to go with thee, both into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and to death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he said: I say to thee, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> me. And he said to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> When I sent you without purse and scrip and shoes, did you want anything?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip: and he that hath not, let him sell his coat and buy a sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> For I say to you that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me. And with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But they said: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them: It is enough.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>. And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And when he was come to the place, he said to them: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a>, lest ye enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast. And kneeling down, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Saying: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And there appeared to him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, strengthening him. And being in an <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">agony</a>, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the longer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And when he rose up from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and was come to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he found them sleeping for sorrow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And he said to them: Why sleep you? Arise: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: lest you enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, for to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, dost thou betray the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, shall we strike with the sword?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And one of them struck the servant of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and cut off his right ear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and magistrates of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, with swords and clubs?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> When I was daily with you in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour and the power of darkness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And apprehending him, they led him to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> house. But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> followed afar off.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were sitting about it, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was in the midst of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also was with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> But he denied him, saying: <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Woman</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said: O <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I am not. <span class="stiki"><strong>Another, etc...</strong> Observe here, in order to reconcile the four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, that divers <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> concurred in charging <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> with being <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>; till at length they brought him to deny him thrice. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->1<!--</a>-->. The porteress that let him in, and afterwards seeing him at the fire, first put the question to him; and then positively affirmed that he was with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->2<!--</a>-->. Another maid accused him to the standers by; and gave occasion to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> here mentioned to renew the charge against him, which caused the second denial. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->3<!--</a>-->. Others of the company took notice of his being a <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a>; and were seconded by the kinsman of Malchus, who affirmed he had seen him in the garden. And this drew on the third denial.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> affirmed, saying: Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was also with him: for he is also a <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> said: Man, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> turning looked on <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> remembered the word of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny thrice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> going out, wept bitterly.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that held him mocked him and struck him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> And they blindfolded him and smote his face. And they asked him saying: <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">Prophesy</a>: Who is it that struck thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a>, many other things they said against him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> came together. And they brought him into their council saying: If thou be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, tell us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> But hereafter the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse70">70</span> Then said they all: Art thou then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Who said: You say that I am.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse71">71</span> And they said: What need we any further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.</span></p>
