<div class="h1a">The continuation of the history of the passion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the whole multitude of them, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up, led him to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> perverting our nation and forbidding to give tribute to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a> and saying that he is <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ the king</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, beginning from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to this place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> hearing <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, asked if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> were of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when he understood that he was of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> jurisdiction, he sent him away to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who was also himself at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in those days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> seeing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, was very glad: for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> stood by, earnestly accusing him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> with his army set him at nought and mocked him, putting on him a white garment: and sent him back to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> were made friends, that same day: for before they were enemies one to another.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling together the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the magistrates and the people,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Said to them: You have presented unto me this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as one that perverteth the people. And behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in those things wherein you accuse him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> No, nor <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> neither. For, I sent you to him: and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I will chastise him therefore and release him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and release unto us Barabbas:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Who, for a certain sedition made in the city and for a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> again spoke to them, desiring to release <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, Crucify him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he said to them the third time: Why, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> hath this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore and let him go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> gave sentence that it should be as they required.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he released unto them him who for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and sedition had been cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, whom they had desired. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> he delivered up to their will.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And there followed him a great multitude of people and of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who bewailed and lamented him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> turning to them, said: Daughters of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> are the barren and the wombs that have not borne and the paps that have not given suck.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us. And to the hills: Cover us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And when they were come to the place which is called <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Calvary</a>, they crucified him there: and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">know not</a> what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others: let him save himself, if he be <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the elect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> him vinegar,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And saying: If thou be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">king of the Jews</a>, save thyself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And there was also a <a href="../cathen/14745b.htm">superscription</a> written over him in letters of Greek and <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And one of those robbers who were hanged <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> him, saying: If thou be <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, save thyself and us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing; thou art under the same condemnation?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And we indeed <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>: for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to thee: This day thou shalt be with me in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">paradise</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>In paradise...</strong> That is, in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state of rest, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and peace everlasting. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was pleased, by a special privilege, to reward the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and confession of the penitent <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, with a full discharge of all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, both as to the guilt and punishment; and to introduce him immediately after death into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> society of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a>, that is, the place of their confinement, was now made a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">paradise</a> by <a href="../cathen/07143d.htm">our Lord's going thither</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And it was almost the <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth hour</a>: and there was darkness over all the earth until the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was rent in the midst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> crying with a loud voice, said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Now, the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>, seeing what was done, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: Indeed this was a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight and saw the things that were done returned, striking their breasts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And all his acquaintance and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that had followed him from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> stood afar off, beholding these things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And behold there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph</a> who was a counsellor, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</span>
