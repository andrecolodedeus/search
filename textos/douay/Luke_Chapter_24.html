<div class="h1a">Christ's resurrection and manifestation of himself to his disciples.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">first day of the week</a>, very early in the morning, they came to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they found the stone rolled back from the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And going in, they found not the body of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> stood by them, in shining apparel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And as they were afraid and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was yet in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Saying: The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must be delivered into the hands of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and be crucified and the third day <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they remembered his words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And going back from the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And it was <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> and Joanna and Mary of James and the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that were with them, who told these things to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And these words seemed to them as idle tales: and they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> rising up, ran to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a> and, stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves: and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, named Emmaus.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it came to pass that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> himself also, drawing near, went with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But their eyes were held, that they should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk and are sad?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the one of them, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was <a href="../cathen/04048b.htm">Cleophas</a>, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and hast not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">known</a> the things that have been done there in these days?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, who was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, mighty in work and word before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And how our chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and princes delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But we hoped that it was he that should have <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeemed</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And now besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Yea and certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also of our company affrighted us who, before it was light, were at the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And not finding his body, came, saying that they had all seen a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who say that he is alive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And some of our people went to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a> and found it so as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> had said: but him they found not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Then he said to them: O foolish and slow of heart to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in all things, which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have spoken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Ought not <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> to have suffered these things and so, to enter into his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And beginning at <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, he expounded to them in all the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> the things that were concerning him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they drew nigh to the town whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But they constrained him, saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> and brake and gave to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And their eyes were opened: and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him. And he vanished out of their sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in the way and opened to us the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up, the same hour, they went back to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were with them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Saying: The <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> is risen indeed and hath appeared to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And they told what things were done in the way: and how they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him in the breaking of bread.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Now, whilst they were speaking these things, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> stood in the midst of them and saith to them: Peace be to you. It is I: Fear not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> See my hands and feet, that it is I myself. Handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> But while they yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not and wondered for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, he said: Have you here any thing to eat?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish and a honeycomb.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and in the psalms, concerning me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to suffer and to <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again from the dead</a>, the third day:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And that <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, unto all nations, beginning at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And you are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And I send the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">promise of my Father</a> upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high. <span class="stiki"><strong>The promise of my Father...</strong> that is, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> that his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> and he would send, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->John<!--</a>--> 14. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->26<!--</a>-->, and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->17<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->7<!--</a>-->.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And he led them out as far as <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a>: and lifting up his hands, he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And it came to pass, whilst he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them, he departed from them and was carried up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And they adoring went back into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And they were always in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, praising and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
