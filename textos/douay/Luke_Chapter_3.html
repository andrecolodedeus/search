<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius Caesar</a>, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> being governor of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> being tetrarch of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and Philip his brother tetrarch of Iturea and the country of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilina:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Under the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>: the word of the Lord was made unto <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, the son of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Zachary<!--</a>-->, in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he came into all the <a href="../cathen/11646b.htm">country about the Jordan</a>, preaching the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> As it was written in the book of the sayings of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> A voice of one crying in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways plain.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And all flesh shall see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him: Ye offspring of vipers, who hath showed you to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>: and do not begin to say, We have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> for our father. For I say unto you that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able of these stones, to raise up children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that bringeth not forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the people asked him, saying: What then shall we do?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he answering, said to them: He that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> also came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, what shall we do?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But he said to them: Do nothing more than that which is appointed you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the soldiers also asked him, saying: And what shall we do? And he said to them: Do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and be content with your pay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And as the people were of opinion, and all were thinking in their hearts of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, that perhaps he might be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> answered, saying unto all: I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water: but there shall come one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose. He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with fire;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Whose fan is in his hand: and he will purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his barn: but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And many other things exhorting did he preach to the people.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the tetrarch</a>, when he was reproved by him for <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>, his brother's wife, and for all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> had done:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> He added this also above all and shut up <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Now it came to pass, when all the people were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> also being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was opened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended in a bodily shape, as a <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a>, upon him.
