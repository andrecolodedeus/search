<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, returned from the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and was led the by the spirit into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For the space of forty days, and was <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And he ate nothing in those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> said to him: If thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, say to this stone that it be made bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered him: is written that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> liveth not by bread alone, but by every <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> led him into a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said to him: To thee will I give all this power and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of them. For to me they are delivered: and to whom I will, I give them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> If thou therefore wilt <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> before me, all shall be thine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering said to him. It is written: Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>, and him only shalt thou serve.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he brought him to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and set him on a pinnacle of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and said to him: If thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, cast thyself from hence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For it is written that He hath given his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge over thee that they keep thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And that in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to him: It is said: Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> being ended, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> departed from him for a time.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> returned in the power of the spirit, into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>: and the fame of him went out through the whole country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he taught in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and was magnified by all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he came to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, where he was brought up: and he went into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, according to his custom, on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>: and he rose up to read.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the book of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a> was delivered unto him. And as he unfolded the book, he found the place where it was written:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The spirit of the Lord is upon me. Wherefore he hath <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->anointed<!--</a>--> me to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrite</a> of heart,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> To preach deliverance to the captives and sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of reward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when he had folded the book, he restored it to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of all in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> were fixed on him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he began to say to them: This day is fulfilled this <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> in your ears.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And all gave testimony to him. And they wondered at the words of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that proceeded from his mouth. And they said: Is not this the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he said to them: Doubtless you will say to me this similitude: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Physician<!--</a>-->, heal thyself. As great things as we have heard done in <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, do also here in thy own country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you that no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is accepted in his own country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> I say to You, there were many <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> in the days of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was shut up three years and six months, when there was a great famine throughout all the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And to none of them was <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> sent, but to <a href="../cathen/13476a.htm">Sarepta of Sidon</a>, to a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And there were many <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus the prophet</a>: and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And all they in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, hearing these things, were filled with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they rose up and thrust him out of the city: and they brought him to the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But he passing through the midst of them, went his way.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he went down into <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, a city of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>: and there he taught them on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his speech was with power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who had an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: and he cried out with a loud voice,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Saying: Let us alone. What have we to do with thee, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>? Art thou come to destroy us? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thee who thou art, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">holy one of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> rebuked him, saying: Hold thy peace and go out of him. And when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had thrown him into the midst, he went out of him and hurt him not at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And there came fear upon all; and they talked among themselves, saying: What word is this, for with authority and power he commandeth the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a>, and they go out?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And the fame of him was published into every place of the country.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, went into <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon's</a> house. And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon's</a> wife's mother was taken with a great fever: and they besought him for her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And standing over her, he commanded the fever: and it left her. And immediately <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>-->, she ministered to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And when the sun was down, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him. But he, laying his hands on every one of them, healed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> went out from many, crying out and saying: Thou art the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>. And rebuking them he suffered them not to speak; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he was <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And when it was day, going out he went into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a>: and the multitudes sought him, and came unto him. And they stayed him that should not depart from them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> To whom he said: To other cities also I must preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>: for therefore am I sent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he was preaching in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span></p>
