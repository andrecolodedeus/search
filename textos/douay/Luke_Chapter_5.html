<h1>Luke Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">The miraculous draught of fishes. The cure of the leper and of the paralytic. The call of Matthew.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a>, he stood by the <a href="../cathen/06413a.htm">lake of Genesareth</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And going into one of the ships that was <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon's</a>, he desired him to draw back a little from the land. And sitting, he taught the multitudes out of the ship.</p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a>: Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a> answering said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, we have laboured all the night and have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both the ships, so that they were almost sinking.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> saw, he fell down at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> knees, saying: Depart from me, for I am a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, O Lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And so were also James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, the sons of Zebedee, who were <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon's</a> partners. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a>: Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> full of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> who, seeing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and falling on his face, besought him saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And stretching forth his hand, he touched him, saying: I will. Be thou cleansed. And immediately the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> departed from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he charged him that he should tell no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but: Go, show thyself to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and offer for thy cleansing according as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded, for a testimony to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the fame of him went abroad the more: and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he retired into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>; and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that there were also <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the law sitting by, that were come out of every town of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and the power of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> was to heal them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And behold, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> brought in a bed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who had the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up upon the roof and let him down through the tiles with his bed into the midst before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> when he saw, he said: Man, thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> began to think, saying: Who is this who speaketh <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>? Who can forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew their thoughts</a>, answering he said to them: What is it you think in your hearts?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Which is easier to say: Thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise and walk?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> hath the power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (he saith to the sick of the palsy), I say to thee to: Arise, take up thy bed and go into thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And immediately <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up before them, he took up the bed on which he lay: and he went away to his own house, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorifying</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And all were astonished: and they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And they were filled with fear, saying: We have seen wonderful things to-day.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And after these things, he went forth and saw a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">Levi</a>, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him: Follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And leaving all things, he rose up and followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">Levi</a> made him a great feast in his own house: And there was a great company of <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and of others that were at table with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> murmured, saying to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Why do you eat and drink with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: They that are whole need not the physician: but they that are sick.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> I came not to call the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, but sinners to <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they said to him: Why do the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> fast often and make <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> in like manner; but thine eat and drink?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> To whom he said: Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast whilst the bridegroom is with them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them: then shall they fast in those days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he spoke also a similitude to them: That no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putteth a piece from a new garment upon an old garment: otherwise he both rendeth the new, and the piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the new wine will break the bottles; and it will be spilled and the bottles will be lost.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But new wine must be put into new bottles: and both are preserved.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> drinking old hath presently a mind to new: for he saith: The old is better.</span></p>
