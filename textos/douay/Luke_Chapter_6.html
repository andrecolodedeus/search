<div class="h1a">Christ excuses his disciples. He cures upon the sabbath day, chooses the twelve and makes a sermon to them.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass on the second first <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> that, as he went through the corn fields, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> plucked the ears and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. <span class="stiki"><strong>The second first sabbath...</strong> Some understand this of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Pentecost<!--</a>-->, which was the second in course among the great feasts: others, of a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a> that immediately followed any solemn feast.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And some of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> said to them: Why do you that which is not lawful on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering them, said: Have you not read so much as this, what <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> did, when himself was hungry and they that were with him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> How he went into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> and took and ate the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">bread of proposition</a> and gave to them that were with him, which is not lawful to eat but only for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he said to them: The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> also of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And it came to pass also, on another <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, that he entered into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and taught. And there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whose right hand was withered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> watched if he would heal on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>: that they might find an accusation against him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But he <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew their thoughts</a> and said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who had the withered hand: Arise and stand forth in the midst. And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> he stood forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: I ask you, if it be lawful on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? To save life or to destroy?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And looking round about on them all, he said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth. And his hand was restored.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they were filled with <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>: and they talked one with another, what they might do to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: and he passed the whole night in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when day was come, he called unto him his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: and he chose twelve of them (whom also he <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a>, whom he surnamed Peter, and <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> his brother, James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, <a href="../cathen/11799a.htm">Philip</a> and <a href="../cathen/02313c.htm">Bartholomew</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Jude the brother of James, and <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, who was the traitor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place: and the company of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and a very great multitude of people from all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the sea coast, both of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Who were come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And they that were troubled with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a> were cured.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And all the multitude sought to touch him: for virtue went out from him and healed all.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he, lifting up his eyes on his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, said: <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">Blessed</a> are ye poor: for yours is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">Blessed</a> are ye that hunger now: for you shall be filled. <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">Blessed</a> are ye that weep now: for you shall laugh.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Be glad in that day and rejoice: for behold, your reward is great in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, For according to these things did their fathers to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But woe to you that are rich: for you have your consolation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Woe to you that are filled: for you shall hunger. Woe to you that now laugh: for you shall mourn and weep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Woe to you when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> you: for according to these things did their fathers to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But I say to you that hear: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Love</a> your enemies. Do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Give to every one that asketh thee: and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And as you would that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should do to you, do you also to them in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, what thanks are to you?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And if you lend to them of whom you <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> to receive, what thanks are to you? For sinners also lend to sinners, for to receive as much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ye your enemies: do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and lend, hoping for nothing thereby: and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Be ye therefore merciful, as your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> also is merciful.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he spoke also to them a similitude: Can the blind lead the blind? Do they not both fall into the ditch?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is not above his master: but every one shall be perfect, if he be as his master.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And why seest thou the mote in thy brother's eye: but the beam that is in thy own eye thou considerest not?</span>
