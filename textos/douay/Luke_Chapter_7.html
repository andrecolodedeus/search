<div class="h1a">Christ heals the centurion's servant. He raises the widow's son to life, answers the messengers sent by John and absolves the penitent sinner.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when he had finished all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered into <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the servant of a certain <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> who was dear to him, being sick, was ready to die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when he had heard of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he sent unto him the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, desiring him to come and heal his servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they came to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, they besought him earnestly, saying to him: He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> our nation: and he hath built us a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> sent his friends to him, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For which cause neither did I think myself worthy to come to thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For I also am a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> subject to authority, having under me soldiers: and I say to one, Go, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> hearing, marvelled: and turning about to the multitude that followed him, he said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not even in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they who were sent, being returned to the house, found the servant whole who had been sick.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it came to pass afterwards that he went into a city that is called <a href="../cathen/10672b.htm">Naim</a>: and there went with him his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and a great multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was carried out, the only son of his mother: and she was a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. And a great multitude of the city was with her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Whom when the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> had seen, being moved with mercy towards her, he said to her: Weep not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he came near and touched the bier. And they that carried it stood still. And he said: Young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I say to thee, arise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he that was dead sat up and begun to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And there came a fear upon them all: and they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saying: A great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is risen up among us: and, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath visited his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and throughout all the country round about.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> told him of all these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> called to him two of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and sent them to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, saying: Art thou <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">he that art to come</a>? Or look we for another?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were come unto him, they said: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> hath sent us to thee, saying: Art thou <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">he that art to come</a>? Or look we for another?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> (And in that same hour, he cured many of their diseases and hurts and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>: and to many that were blind he gave sight.)</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And answering, he said to them: Go and relate to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> what you have heard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, to the poor the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> is preached.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> is he whosoever shall not be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> in me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when the messengers of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> were departed, he began to speak to the multitudes concerning <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>. What went ye out into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But what went you out to see? A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are in costly apparel and live delicately are in the houses of kings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But what went you out to see? A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? Yea, I say to you, and more than a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> This is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For I say to you: Amongst those that are born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, there is not a greater <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>. But he that is the lesser in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is greater than he.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And all the people hearing, and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, justified <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Justified God...</strong> that is, praised the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, feared and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->worshipped<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and merciful.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the lawyers <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against themselves, being not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said: Whereunto then shall I liken the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>? And to what are they like?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> They are like to children sitting in the marketplace and speaking one to another and saying: We have piped to you, and you have not <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">danced</a>: we have mourned, and you have not wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> For <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> came neither eating bread nor drinking wine. And you say: He hath a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is come eating and drinking.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And wisdom is justified by all her children.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And one of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> desired him to eat with him.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And behold a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that was in the city, a sinner, when she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he sat at meat in the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee's</a> house, brought an alabaster box of <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And standing behind at his feet she began to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash his feet</a> with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> his feet and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->anointed<!--</a>--> them with the <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, who had invited him, seeing it, spoke within himself, saying: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he were if a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> surely who and what manner of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Simon<!--</a>-->, I have somewhat to say to thee.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And whereas they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which therefore of the two <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> him most?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Simon<!--</a>--> answering, said: I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said to him: Thou hast judged rightly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And turning to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, he said unto <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Simon<!--</a>-->: Dost thou see this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Thou gavest me no <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. But she, since she came in, hath not ceased to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> my feet.</span>
