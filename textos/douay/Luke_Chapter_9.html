<div class="h1a">Christ sends forth his apostles, feeds five thousand with five loaves, is transfigured and casts out a devil.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then calling together the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, he gave them power and authority over all <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> and to cure diseases.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he sent them to preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and to heal the sick.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said to them: Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And whatsoever house you shall enter into, abide there and depart not from thence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off even the dust of your feet, for a testimony against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And going out, they went about through the towns, preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> and healing every where.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod, the tetrarch</a>, heard of all things that were done by him. And he was in a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, because it was said</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> By some that <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was risen from the dead: but by other some, that <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> had appeared: and by others, that one of the old <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">risen again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> said: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> I have beheaded. But who is this of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, when they were returned, told him all they had done. And taking them, he went aside into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a>, apart, which belongeth to <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Which when the people <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, they followed him: and he received them and spoke to them of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> and healed them who had need of healing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now the day began to decline. And the twelve came and said to him: Send away the multitude, that, going into the towns and <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> round about, they may lodge and get victuals; for we are here in a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But he said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said: We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; unless perhaps, we should go and buy food for all this multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Now there were about five thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they did so and made them all sit down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them: and he broke and distributed to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to set before the multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they did all eat and were filled. And there were taken up of fragments that remained to them, twelve baskets.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And it came to pass, as he was alone <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also were with him: and he asked them, saying: Whom do the people say that I am?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But they answered and said: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>; but some say <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>: and others say that one of the former <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> is <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">risen again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he said to them: But whom do you say that I am? <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> answering, said: <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">The Christ of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But he strictly charging them, commanded they should tell this to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Saying: The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must suffer many things and be rejected by the ancients and chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and be killed and the third day <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he said to all: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For whosoever will save his <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> shall lose it: for he that shall lose his <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> for my sake shall save it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For what is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> advantaged, if he gain the whole world and lose himself and cast away himself?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be ashamed, when he shall come in his majesty and that of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But I tell you of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: There are some standing here that shall not taste death till they see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that he took <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> and went up into a mountain to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And whilst he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, the shape of his countenance was <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">altered</a> and his raiment became white and glittering.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And behold two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were talking with him. And they were <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Appearing in majesty. And they spoke of his decease that he should accomplish in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and they that were with him were heavy with sleep. And waking, they saw his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that stood with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And it came to pass that, as they were departing from him, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> saith to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: Master, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here: and let us make three <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->tabernacles<!--</a>-->, one for thee, and one for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and one for <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>: not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what he said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And as he spoke these things, there came a cloud and overshadowed them. And they were afraid when they entered into the cloud.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And a voice came out of the cloud; saying: This is my beloved son. Hear him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And whilst the voice was uttered <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was found alone. And they held their peace and told no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in those days any of these things which they had seen.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And it came to pass the day following, when they came down from the mountain, there met him a great multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And behold a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> among the crowd cried out, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, I beseech thee, look upon my son, because he is my only one.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And lo, a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirit</a> seizeth him, and he suddenly crieth out, and he throweth him down and teareth him, so that he foameth; and bruising him, he hardly departeth from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And I desired thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast him out</a>: and they could not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, answering, said: O faithless and perverse <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring hither thy son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And as he was coming to him, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> threw him down and tore him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> rebuked the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a> and cured the boy and restored him to his father.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And all were astonished at the mighty power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But while all wondered at all the things he did, he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Lay you up in your hearts these words, for it shall come to pass that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be delivered into the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> But they understood not this word: and it was hid from them, so that they perceived it not. And they were afraid to ask him concerning this word.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And there entered a thought into them, which of them should be greater.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> seeing the thoughts of their hearts, took a child and set him by him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And said to them: Whosoever shall receive this child in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me. For he that is the lesser among you all, he is the greater.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, answering, said: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, we saw a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">casting out devils</a> in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Forbid him not: for he that is not against you is for you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And it came to pass, when the days of his assumption were accomplishing, that he steadfastly set his face to go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And he sent messengers before his face: and going, they entered into a city of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, to prepare for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And they received him not, because his face was of one going to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And when his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, had seen this, they said: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and consume them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And turning, he rebuked them, saying: you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not of <a href="../cathen/05028b.htm">what spirit</a> you are.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came not to destroy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but to save. And they went into another town.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And it came to pass, as they walked in the way, that a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said to him: I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests: but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> hath not where to lay his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> But he said to another: Follow me. And he said: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, suffer me first to go and to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->bury<!--</a>--> my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Let the dead <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->bury<!--</a>--> their dead: but go thou and preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And another said: I will follow thee, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->; but let me first take my leave of them that are at my house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putting his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span></p>
