<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: I will send poverty upon you, and will <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> your <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, yea I will <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> them, because you have not laid it to heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Behold, I will cast the shoulder to you, and will scatter upon your face the dung of your solemnities, and it shall take you away with it. <span class="stiki"><strong>I will cast the shoulder to you...</strong> I will cast away the shoulder, which in the law was appointed to be your portion, and fling it at you in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: and will reject both you and your festivals like dung.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I sent you this commandment, that my covenant might be with <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> My covenant was with him of life and peace: and I gave him fear: and he feared me, and he was afraid before my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The law of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was in his mouth, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace, and in equity, and turned many away from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For the lips of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> shall keep <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and they shall seek the law at his mouth: because he is the angel of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The angel...</strong> Viz., the minister and messenger.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But you have departed out of the way, and have caused many to stumble at the law: you have made void the covenant of <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levi</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Therefore have I also made you contemptible, and base before all people, as you have not kept my ways, and have accepted <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the law.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Have we not all one father? hath not one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created us? why then doth every one of us <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> his brother, violating the covenant of our fathers?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> hath transgressed, and abomination hath been committed in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: for <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> hath profaned the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>, and hath <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> the daughter of a strange god.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And you have said: For what cause? Because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath been witness between thee, and the wife of thy youth, whom thou hast <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>: yet she was thy partner, and the wife of thy covenant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Did not one make her, and she is the residue of his spirit? And what doth one seek, but the seed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Keep then your spirit, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> not the wife of thy youth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> When thou shalt <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> her <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put her away</a>, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> shalt cover his garment, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, keep your spirit, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> not. <span class="stiki"><strong>Iniquity shall cover his garment...</strong> Viz., of every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that putteth away his wife without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> cause; notwithstanding that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permitted it in the law, to prevent the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.</span></span></p>
