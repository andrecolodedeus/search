<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then they that feared the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, spoke every one with his neighbour: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave ear, and heard it: and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and think on his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they shall be my special possession, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, in the day that I do <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->: and I will spare them, as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spareth his son that serveth him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And you shall return, and shall see the difference between the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: and between him that serveth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and him that serveth him not.</span></p>
