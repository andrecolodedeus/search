<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> As it is written in <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a>:</p>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> and preaching the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, unto <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">remission of sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And there went out to him all the country of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and all they of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him in the river of <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was clothed with <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">camel's hair</a>, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he preached, saying: There cometh after me <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">one mightier than I</a>, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> I have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> you with water: but he shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And it came to pass, in those days, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth of Galilee</a> and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And forthwith coming up out of the water, he saw the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> open and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> as a <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> descending and remaining on him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And there came a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: Thou art my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; in thee I am well pleased.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And immediately the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> drove him out into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he was in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. And he was with beasts: and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> ministered to him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And after that <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was delivered up, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And saying: The time is accomplished and the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is at hand. <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">Repent</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And passing by the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">sea of Galilee</a>, he saw <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a> and <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> his brother, casting nets into the sea for they were fishermen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: Come after me; and I will make you to become fishers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And going on from thence a little farther, he saw <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James the son of Zebedee</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they followed him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they entered into <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>: and forthwith upon the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a> going into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, he taught them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And there was in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a>; and he cried out,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Saying: What have we to do with thee, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>? Art thou come to destroy us? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who thou art, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Holy One of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">go out</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a>, tearing him and crying out with a loud voice, <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">went out</a> of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? What is this new doctrine? For with power he commandeth even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a>: and they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And immediately going out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> they came into the house of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a> and <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a>, with <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon's</a> wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> with <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases. And he <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> many <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>: and he suffered them not to speak, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And rising very early, going out, he went into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a>: and there he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And <a href="../cathen/13796b.htm">Simon</a> and they that were with him followed after him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he was preaching in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and in all <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and casting out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And there came a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> to him, beseeching him and <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneeling</a> down, said to him: If thou wilt thou canst make me <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand and touching him saith to him: I will. Be thou made <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And when he had spoken, immediately the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> departed from him: and he was made <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And he strictly charged him and forthwith sent him away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, show thyself to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offer</a> for thy <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">cleansing</a> the things that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded, for a testimony to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert places</a>. And they flocked to him from all sides.</span></p>
