<div class="h1a">Marriage is not to be dissolved. The danger of riches. The ambition of the sons of Zebedee. A blind man is restored to his sight.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up from thence, he cometh into the coast of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>: and the multitude flocked to him again. And as he was accustomed, he taught them again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> coming to him asked him, tempting him: Is it lawful for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But he answering, saith to them: What did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> command you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Who said: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> permitted to write a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> and to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put her away</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> To whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said: Because of the hardness of your heart, he wrote you that <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precept</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But from the beginning of the creation, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made them male and female.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For this cause, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> What therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath joined together, let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put asunder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And in the house again his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> asked him concerning the same thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he saith to them: Whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife and <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry another</a> committeth <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> against her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And if the wife shall put away her husband and be <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">married to another</a>, she committeth <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they brought to him young children, that he might touch them. And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> rebuked them that brought them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Whom when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saw, he was much displeased and saith to them: Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not: for of such is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, whosoever shall not receive the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> as a little child shall not enter into it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And embracing them and laying his hands upon them, he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when he was gone forth into the way, a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, running up and kneeling before him, asked him: <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, what shall I do that I may receive life everlasting?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Why callest thou me <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but one, that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>None is good...</strong> Of himself entirely and essentially, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> also, but only by participation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> the commandments: Do not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, do not kill, do not steal, bear not <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness, do no <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> thy father and mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But he answering, said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, all these things I have observed from my youth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, looking on him, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee. Go, sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor: and thou shalt have treasure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. And come, follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Who being struck sad at that saying, went away sorrowful: for he had great <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> looking round about, saith to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were astonished at his words. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> again answering, saith to them: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Children<!--</a>-->, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Who wondered the more, saying among themselves: Who then can be saved?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> looking on them, saith with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> it is impossible; but not with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For all things are possible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> began to say unto him: Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my sake and for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Who shall not receive an hundred times as much, now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>: and in the world to come life everlasting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But many that are first shall be last: and the last, first.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they were in the way going up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went before them. And they were astonished and following were afraid. And taking again the twelve, he began to tell them the things that should befall him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Saying: Behold we go up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and ancients. And they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And they shall mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him: and the third day he shall <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, we desire that whatsoever we shall ask, thou wouldst do it for us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But he said to them: What would you that I should do for you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And they said: Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand, in thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what you ask. Can you drink of the chalice that I drink of or be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherewith I am <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> But they said to him: We can. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: You shall indeed drink of the chalice that I drink of; and with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherewith I am <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> But to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And the ten, hearing it, began to be much displeased at James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> calling them, saith to them: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they who seem to rule over the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> lord it over them: and their princes have power over them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> But it is not so among you: but whosoever will be greater shall be your minister.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And whosoever will be first among you shall be the servant of all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> also is not come to be ministered unto: but to minister and to give his life a <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> for many.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And they came to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. And as he went out of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and a very great multitude, Bartimeus the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the son of Timeus, sat by the way side begging.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Who when he had heard that it was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, began to cry out and to say: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>, have mercy on me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace; but he cried a great deal the more: <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>, have mercy on me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, standing still, commanded him to be called. And they call the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, saying to him: Be of better comfort. Arise, he calleth thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Who casting off his garment leaped up and came to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to him: What wilt thou that I should do to thee? And the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said to him: Rabboni. That I may see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: Go thy way. Thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> hath made thee whole. And immediately he saw and followed him in the way.</span></p>
