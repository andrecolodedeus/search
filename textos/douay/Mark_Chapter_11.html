<div class="h1a">Christ enters into Jerusalem upon an ass. He curses the barren fig tree and drives the buyers and sellers out of the temple.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when they were drawing near to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and to <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount of Olives</a>, he sendeth two of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And saith to them: Go into the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">village</a> that is over against you, and immediately at your coming in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> yet hath sat. Loose him and bring him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall say to you: What are you doing? Say ye that the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> hath need of him. And immediately he will let him come hither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And going their way, they found the colt tied before the gate without, in the meeting of two ways. And they loose him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And some of them that stood there said to them: What do you loosing the colt?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Who said to them as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had commanded them. And they let him go with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they brought the colt to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. And they lay their garments on him: and he sat upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down boughs from the trees and strewed them in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they that went before and they that followed cried, saying: <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a>: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is he that cometh in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the kingdom of our father <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> that cometh: <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->highest<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he entered into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and having viewed all things round about, when now the eventide was come, he went out to <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a> with the twelve.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the next day when they came out from <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a>, he was hungry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when he had seen afar off a fig tree having leaves, he came, if perhaps he might find any thing on it. And when he was come to it, he found nothing but leaves. For it was not the time for figs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And answering he said to it: May no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hereafter eat fruit of thee any more for ever! And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> heard it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. And when he was entered into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, he began to cast out them that sold and bought in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and over threw the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of them that sold doves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he suffered not that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should carry a vessel through the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written: My house shall be called the house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to all nations, but you have made it a den of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thieves</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Which when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> had heard, they sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because the whole multitude was in admiration at his doctrine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when evening was come, he went forth out of the city.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> remembering, said to him: Rabbi, behold the fig tree which thou didst <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> is withered away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, saith to them: Have the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and be cast into the sea, and shall not stagger in his heart, but be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that whatsoever he saith shall be done; it shall be done unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Therefore I say unto you, all things, whatsoever you ask when ye <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you shall receive: and they shall come unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when you shall stand to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, forgive, if you have aught against any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: that your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> also, who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, may forgive you your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But if you will not forgive, neither will your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">father</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> forgive you your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And they come again to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. And when he was walking in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, there come to him the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the ancients.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they say to him: By what authority dost thou these things? And who hath given thee this authority that thou shouldst do these things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: I will also ask you one word. And answer you me: and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, was it from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? Answer me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But they thought with themselves, saying: If we say, From <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; he will say, Why then did you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> If we say, From <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, we fear the people.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they answering, say to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, saith to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span></p>
