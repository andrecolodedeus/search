<h1>Mark Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">The parable of the vineyard and husbandmen. Caesar's right to tribute. The Sadducees are confuted. The first commandment. The widow's mite.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he began to speak to them in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>: A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> planted a vineyard and made a hedge about it and dug a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it to husbandmen: and went into a far country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Who, having laid hands on him, beat and sent him away empty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And again he sent to them another servant: and him they wounded in the head and used him reproachfully.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And again he sent another, and him they killed: and many others, of whom some they beat, and others they killed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore, having yet one son, most dear to him, he also sent him unto them last of all, saying: They will reverence my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But the husbandmen said one to another: This is the heir. Come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And laying hold on him, they killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those husbandmen and will give the vineyard to others.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And have you not read this <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">head of the corner</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> By the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they sought to lay hands on him: but they feared the people. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he spoke this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to them. And leaving him, they went their way.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they sent to him some of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and of the Herodians: that they should catch him in his words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Who coming, say to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou art a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> speaker and carest not for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for thou regardest not the person of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but teachest the way of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Is it lawful to give tribute to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>? Or shall we not give it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Who <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> their wiliness, saith to them: Why <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> you me? Bring me a penny that I may see it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they brought it him. And he saith to them: Whose is this image and inscription? They say to him, <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: Render therefore to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a> the things that are <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the things that are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>. And they marvelled at him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And there came to him the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked him, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote unto us that if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife and died leaving no issue.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the second took her and died: and neither did he leave any issue. And the third in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the seven all took her in like manner and did not leave issue. Last of all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> also died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> In the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> therefore, when they shall rise again, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, saith to them: Do ye not therefore <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, because you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For when they shall <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again from the dead</a>, they shall neither <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>, nor be <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a>, but are as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And as concerning the dead that they <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a> have you not read in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of Moses</a>, how in the bush <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spoke to him, saying: I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead, but of the living. You therefore do greatly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And there came one of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> that had heard them reasoning together, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first commandment of all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart and with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and with thy whole mind and with thy whole strength. This is the first commandment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the second is like to it: Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a> said to him: Well, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, thou hast said in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> and there is no other besides him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And that he should be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> with the whole heart and with the whole understanding and with the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and with the whole strength. And to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one's neighbour as one's self is a greater thing than all <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him: Thou art not far from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> after that durst ask him any question.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said, teaching in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: How do the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> say that <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> is the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> himself saith by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: The <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> said to my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> therefore himself calleth him <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->. And whence is he then his son? And a great multitude heard him gladly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he said to them in his doctrine: Beware of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to walk in long robes and to be saluted in the marketplace,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And to sit in the first chairs in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and to have the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->highest<!--</a>--> places at suppers:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Who devour the houses of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> under the pretence of long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. These shall receive greater <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> sitting over against the treasury, beheld how the people cast money into the treasury. And many that were rich cast in much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And there came a certain poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>: and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And calling his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> together, he saith to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, this poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> For all they did cast in of their <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->abundance<!--</a>-->; but she of her want cast in all she had, even her whole living.</span></p>
