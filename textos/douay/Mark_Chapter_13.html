<div class="h1a">Christ foretells the destruction of the temple and the signs that shall forerun the day of judgment.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And as he was going out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> said to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, behold what manner of stones and what buildings are here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to him: Seest thou all these great buildings? There shall not be left a stone upon a stone, that shall not be thrown down.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And as he sat on the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount of Olivet</a> over against the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> and <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> asked him apart:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Tell us, when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall begin to be fulfilled?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, began to say to them: Take heed lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> deceive you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For many shall come in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> saying, I am he: and they shall deceive many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, fear ye not. For such things must needs be: but the end is not yet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and famines. These things are the beginning of sorrows.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But look to yourselves. For they shall deliver you Up to councils: and in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> you shall be beaten: and you shall stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And unto all nations the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> must first be preached.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when they shall lead you and deliver you up, be not thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye. For it is not you that speak, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the brother shall betray his brother unto death, and the father his son; and children shall rise up against their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and shall work their death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And you shall be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake. But he that shall endure unto the end, he shall be saved.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when you shall see the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, standing where it ought not (he that readeth let him understand): then let them that are in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> flee unto the mountains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house nor enter therein to take any thing out of the house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And let him that shall be in the field not turn back to take up his garment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> ye that these things happen not in winter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For in those days shall be such tribulations as were not from the beginning of the creation which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created until now: neither shall be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And unless the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> had shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but, for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> which he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And then if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall say to you: Lo, here is <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. Lo, he is here: do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For there will rise up <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">false Christs</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and they shall show <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a>, to seduce (if it were possible) even the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Take you heed therefore: behold, I have foretold you all things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shall be falling down and the powers that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shall be moved.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And then shall they see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in the clouds, with great power and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And then shall he send his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and shall gather together his <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Now of the fig tree learn ye a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>. When the branch thereof is now tender and the leaves are come forth, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that summer is very near.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So you also when you shall see these things come to pass, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that it is very nigh, even at the doors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, I say to you that this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> shall not pass until all these things be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my word shall not pass away.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But of that day or hour no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">nor the Son</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Nor the Son...</strong> Not that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is absolutely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the day of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->, but that he <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knoweth</a> it not, as our teacher; that is, he <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knoweth</a> it not so as to teach it to us, as not being expedient.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Take ye heed, watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not when the time is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Even as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who, going into a far country, left his house and gave authority to his servants over every work and commanded the porter to watch.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Watch ye therefore (for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not when the lord of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock crowing, or in the morning):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Lest coming on a sudden, he find you sleeping.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch.</span></p>
