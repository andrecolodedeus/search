<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">Azymes</a> was after two days: and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him and kill him. <span class="stiki"><strong>Azymes...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the unleavened bread</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when he was in <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a>, in the house of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Simon<!--</a>--> the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, and was at meat, there came a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> having an alabaster box of <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> of precious spikenard. And breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now there were some that had indignation within themselves and said: Why was this waste of the <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> made?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For this <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: Let her alone. Why do You molest her? She hath wrought a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">work</a> upon me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: but me you have not always.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->anoint<!--</a>--> my body for the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->burial<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, I say to you, wheresoever this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memorial of her.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, one of the twelve, went to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to betray him to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who hearing it were glad: and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now on the first day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">unleavened bread</a>, when they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go and prepare for thee to eat the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he sendeth two of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a> with my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he will show you a large dining room furnished. And there prepare ye for us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> went their way and came into the city. And they found as he had told them: and they prepared the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when they were at table and eating, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But they began to be sorrowful and to say to him, one by one: Is it I?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by whom the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not been born.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And whilst they were eating, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> took bread; and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, broke and gave to them and said: Take ye. This is my body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when they had sung an hymn, they went forth to the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount of Olives</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: You will all be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> in my regard this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But after I shall be <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>, I will go before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> saith to him: Although all shall be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> in thee, yet not I.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to thee, to-day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. <span class="stiki"><strong>Crow twice...</strong> The cocks crow at two different times of the night; viz., about midnight for the first time; and then about the time commonly called the cock crowing; and this was the cock crowing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> spoke of; and therefore the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> take no notice of the first crowing.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they came to a farm called <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Gethsemani</a>. And he saith to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Sit you here, while I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he taketh <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> with him: and he began to fear and to be heavy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he saith to them: My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death. Stay you here and watch.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground: and he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that, if it might be, the hour might pass from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he saith: <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba, Father</a>, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And he cometh and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a>, sleepest thou? Couldst thou not watch one hour?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Watch ye: and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And going away again, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying the same words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And when he returned, he found them again asleep (for their eyes were heavy): and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what to answer him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And he cometh the third time and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest. It is enough. The hour is come: behold the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Rise<!--</a>--> up: let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And while he was yet speaking, cometh <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the ancients.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, that is he. Lay hold on him: and lead him away carefully.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And when he was come, immediately going up to him he saith: Hail, Rabbi! And he <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> But they laid hands on him and held him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and cut off his ear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> I was daily with you in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> teaching: and you did not lay hands on me. But that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> may be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> Then his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, leaving him, all fled away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And a <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">certain young man</a> followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body. And they laid hold on him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And they brought <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. And all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the ancients assembled together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> followed him afar off, even into the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. And he sat with the servants at the fire and warmed himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and all the council sought for evidence against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that they might put him to death: and found none.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> For many bore <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness against him: and their evidences were not agreeing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And some <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up, bore <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness against him, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> We heard him say, I will destroy this <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And their witness did not agree.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> up in the midst, asked <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> asked him and said to him: Art thou the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the Blessed God</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: I am. And you shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> sitting on the right hand of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and coming with the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> rending his garments, saith: What need we any further <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> You have heard the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him: <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">Prophesy</a>. And the servants struck him with the palms their hands.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> Now when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> And when she had seen <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> warming himself looking on him, she saith: Thou also wast with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> But he denied, saying: I neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>; and the cock crew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse70">70</span> But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse71">71</span> But he began o <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> and to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, saying: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of whom you speak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse72">72</span> And immediately the cock crew again. And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> remembered the word that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep,</span></p>
