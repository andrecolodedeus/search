<div class="h1a">The continuation of the history of the passion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And straightway in the morning, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> holding a consultation with the ancients and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the whole council, binding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, led him away and delivered him to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> asked him: Art thou the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> accused him in many things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? Behold in how many things they accuse thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> still answered nothing: so that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> wondered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> with some seditious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who in the sedition had committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do as he had ever done unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered them and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had delivered him up out of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But they again cried out: Crucify him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saith to them: Why, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And so <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas: and delivered up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the soldiers led him away into the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the palace: and they called together the whole band.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they clothed him with purple: and, platting a <a href="../cathen/04540b.htm">crown of thorns</a>, they put it upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him and put his own garments on him: and they led him out to crucify him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And they forced one <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Simon<!--</a>--> a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Cyrenian<!--</a>-->, who passed by coming out of the country, the father of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Alexander<!--</a>--> and of <a href="../cathen/13222b.htm">Rufus</a>, to take up his cross.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they bring him into the place called <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Golgotha</a>, which being interpreted is, <em>The place of Calvary</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh. But he took it not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should take.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And it was the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>: and they crucified him. <span class="stiki"><strong>The third hour...</strong> The ancient account divided the day into four parts, which were <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> from the hour from which they began; the <a href="../cathen/12424a.htm">first</a>, <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third</a>, <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was crucified a little before noon; before the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> had quite expired; but when the <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth hour</a> was near at hand.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->JEWS<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And with him they crucify two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thieves</a>: the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> was fulfilled, which saith: And with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> he was reputed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And they that passed by <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> him, wagging their heads and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> and in three days buildest it up again:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Save thyself, coming down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> In like manner also the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, mocking, said with the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Let <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ the king of Israel</a> come down now from the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>, that we may see and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And they that were crucified with him, <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">reviled</a> him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth hour</a> was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And at the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cried out with a loud voice, saying: <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Eloi</a>, <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Eloi</a>, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted: My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Why hast thou forsaken me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> come to take him down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And the veil of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a> said: Indeed this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And there were also <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> looking on afar off: among whom was <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Mary<!--</a>--> the mother of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James the Less</a> and of <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Joseph<!--</a>--> and <a href="../cathen/13403a.htm">Salome</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Who also when he was in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> followed him and ministered to him, and many other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that came up with him to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And when evening was now come (because it was the <a href="../cathen/11476a.htm">Parasceve</a>, that is, the day before the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, came and went in boldly to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> But <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>, he asked him if he were already dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And when he had understood it by the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>, he gave the body to <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph</a>.</span>
