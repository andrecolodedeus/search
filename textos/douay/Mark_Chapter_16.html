<div class="h1a">Christ's resurrection and ascension.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> was past, <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> and Mary the mother of James and <a href="../cathen/13403a.htm">Salome</a> bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And very early in the morning, the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">first day of the week</a>, they come to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>, the sun being now risen. <span class="stiki"><strong>The sun being now risen...</strong> They set out before it was light, to go to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>; but the sun was risen when they arrived there. Or, figuratively, the sun here spoken of is the sun of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, who was risen before their coming.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And entering into the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Who saith to them: Be not affrighted, you seek <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, who was crucified. He is risen: he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But go, tell his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> that he goeth before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. There you shall see him, as he told you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But they going out, fled from the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>: for a trembling and fear had seized them. And they said nothing to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for they were afraid.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But he <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> early the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">first day of the week</a>, appeared first to <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>; out of whom he had cast seven <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they hearing that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they going told it to the rest: neither did they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them who had seen him after he was <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world and preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> to every creature.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved: but he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not shall he condemned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And these signs shall follow them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: In my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> they shall <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>. They shall <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speak with new tongues</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> They shall take up serpents: and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">lay their hand</a> upon the sick: and they shall recover.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and sitteth on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But they going forth preached every where: the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.</span></p>
