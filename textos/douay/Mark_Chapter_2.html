<h1>Mark Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ heals the sick of the palsy. He calls Matthew and excuses his disciples.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And again he entered into <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a> after some days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And it was heard that he was in the house. And many came together, so that there was no room: no, not even at the door. And he spoke to them the word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they came to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was carried by four.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was: and opening it, they let down the bed wherein the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sick of the palsy lay.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had seen their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he saith to the sick of the palsy: Son, thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">forgiven</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And there were some of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> sitting there and thinking in their hearts:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Why doth this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> speak thus? He <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemeth</a>. Who can forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> presently <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing in his spirit</a> that they so thought within themselves, saith to them: Why think you these things in your hearts?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy: Thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise, take up thy bed and walk?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> hath power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (he saith to the sick of the palsy):</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I say to thee: Arise. Take up thy bed and go into thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And immediately he arose and, taking up his bed, went his way in the sight of all: so that all wondered and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: We never saw the like.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he went forth again to the sea side: and all the multitude came to him. And he taught them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when he was passing by, he saw <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">Levi, the son of Alpheus</a>, sitting at the receipt of custom; and he saith to him: Follow me. And rising up, he followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it came to pass as he sat at meat in his house, many <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">Publicans</a> and sinners sat down together with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For they were many, who also followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, seeing that he ate with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners, said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Why doth your master eat and drink with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> hearing this, saith to them: They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. For I came not to call the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, but sinners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> used to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>. And they come and say to him: Why do the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>; but thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> do not <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: Can the children of the <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>, as long as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them: and then they shall <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> in those days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment: otherwise the new piecing taketh away from the old, and there is made a greater rent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the wine will burst the bottles, and both the wine will be spilled and the bottles will be lost. But new wine must be put into new bottles.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And it came to pass again, as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> walked through the corn fields on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, that his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> began to go forward and to pluck the ears of corn.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> said to him: Behold, why do they on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a> that which is not <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">lawful</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he said to them: Have you never read what <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> did when he had need and was hungry, himself and they that were with him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> How he went into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, under <a href="../cathen/01043a.htm">Abiathar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and did eat the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">loaves of proposition</a>, which was not <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">lawful</a> to eat but for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and gave to them who were with him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he said to them: The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> was made for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> also.</span></p>
