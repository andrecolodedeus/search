<div class="h1a">Christ heals the withered hand. He chooses the twelve. He confutes the blasphemy of the Pharisees.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he entered again into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: and there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there who had a withered hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they watched him whether he would heal on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a>, that they might accuse him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he saith to them: Is it <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">lawful</a> to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a>, or to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? To save <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, or to destroy? But they held their peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And looking round about on them with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> retired with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">sea</a>; and a great multitude followed him from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he spoke to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that a small ship should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a>, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Thou art the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> who were come down from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, said: He hath <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, and by the prince of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> he <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">casteth out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> No <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can enter into the house of a strong <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> him of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>, unless he first bind the strong <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and then shall he <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">plunder</a> his house.</span>
