<h1>Mark Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">The parable of the sower. Christ stills the tempest at sea.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And again he began to teach by the sea side; and a great multitude was gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship and sat in the sea: and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he taught them many things in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and said unto them in his doctrine:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Hear ye: Behold, the sower went out to sow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And some fell upon <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ground; and brought forth fruit that grew up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said to them: To you it is given to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>: but to them that are without, all things are done in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">forgiven</a> them. <span class="stiki"><strong>That seeing they may see, etc...</strong> in punishment of their wilfully shutting their eyes, (<a href="../douay/mat013.htm#verse15">Matthew 13:15</a>), <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> withdrew those lights and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, which otherwise he would have given them, for their effectual <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he saith to them: Are you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>? And how shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He that soweth, soweth the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And these are they by the way side, where the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a> is sown, and as soon as they have heard, immediately <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> cometh and taketh away the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a> that was sown in their hearts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground: who when they have heard the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>, immediately receive it with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time: and then when tribulation and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ariseth for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a> they are presently <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And others there are who are sown among thorns: these are they that hear the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made fruitless.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And these are they who are sown upon the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ground, who hear the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he said to them: Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? And not to be set on a candlestick?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have ears to hear, let him hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he said to them: Take heed what you hear. In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he said: So is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, as if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should cast seed into the earth,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he said: To what shall we liken the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>? Or to what <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> shall we compare it?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> It is as a grain of mustard seed: which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And with many such <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, he spoke to them the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>, according as they were able to hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And without <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And he saith to them that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship: and there were other ships with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him: Master, doth it not concern thee that we perish?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased: and there was made a great calm.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And he said to them: Why are you fearful? Have you not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> yet? And they feared exceedingly: and they said one to another: Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him?</span></p>
