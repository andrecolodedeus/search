<div class="h1a">Christ casts out a legion of devils: he heals the issue of blood, and raises the daughter of Jairus to life.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And they came over the strait of the sea, into the country of the <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">Gerasens</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And as he went out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the monuments a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Who had his dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> now could bind him, not even with chains.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For having been often bound with fetters and chains, he had burst the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces, and no one could tame him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he was always day and night in the monuments and in the mountains, crying and cutting himself with stones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And seeing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> afar off, he ran and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And crying with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the most high God</a>? I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> thee by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that thou torment me not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For he said unto him: <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">Go out</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, thou <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he asked him: What is thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>? And he saith to him: My <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is Legion, for we are many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he besought him much, that he would not <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">drive him away</a> out of the country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine, feeding.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirits</a> besought him, saying: Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> immediately gave them leave. And the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">going out</a>, entered into the swine: and the herd with great <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> was carried headlong into the sea, being about two thousand, were stifled in the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the fields. And they went out to see what was done:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they came to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and they see him that was troubled with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, sitting, clothed, and well in his wits, and they were afraid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they that had seen it, told them, in what manner he had been dealt with who had the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and concerning the swine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they began to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> him that he would depart from their coasts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And when he went up into the ship, he that had been troubled with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, began to beseech him that he might be with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he admitted him not, but saith to him: Go into thy house to thy friends, and tell them how great things the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath done for thee, and hath had mercy on thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he went his way, and began to publish in <a href="../cathen/04664b.htm">Decapolis</a> how great things <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had done for him: and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> wondered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had passed again in the ship over the strait, a great multitude assembled together unto him, and he was nigh unto the sea.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And there cometh one of the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Jairus: and seeing him, falleth down at his feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he besought him much, saying: My daughter is at the point of death, come, lay thy hand upon her, that she may be safe, and may live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was under an issue of blood twelve years,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And had suffered many things from many physicians; and had spent all that she had, and was nothing the better, but rather worse,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> When she had heard of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, came in the crowd behind him, and touched his garment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For she said: If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And immediately <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing in himself</a> the virtue that had proceeded from him, turning to the multitude, said: Who hath touched my garments?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> said to him: Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou who hath touched me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he looked about to see her who had done this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> fearing and trembling, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And he said to her: Daughter, thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> hath made thee whole: go in peace, and be thou whole of thy disease.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> While he was yet speaking, some come from the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue's</a> house, saying: Thy daughter is dead: why dost thou trouble the master any further?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> having heard the word that was spoken, saith to the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: Fear not, only <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And he admitted not any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to follow him, but <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> the brother of <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And they come to the house of the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>; and he seeth a tumult, and people weeping and wailing much.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And going in, he saith to them Why make you this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they laughed him to scorn. But he having put them all out, taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And taking the damsel by the hand, he saith to her: <em>Talitha cumi</em>, which is, being interpreted: Damsel (I say to thee) arise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And immediately the damsel rose up, and walked: and she was twelve years old: and they were astonished with a great astonishment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And he charged them strictly that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it: and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</span></p>
