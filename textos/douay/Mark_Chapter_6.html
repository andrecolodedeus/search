<h1>Mark Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ teaches at Nazareth: he sends forth the twelve apostles: he feeds five thousand with five loaves; and walks upon the sea.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And going out from thence, he went into his own country; and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was come, he began to teach in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: and many hearing him were in admiration at his doctrine, saying: How came this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by all these things? and what wisdom is this that is given to him, and such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">mighty works</a> as are wrought by his hands?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother</a> of <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, and Joseph, and <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a>, and Simon? are not also his <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">sisters</a> here with us? And they were <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> in regard of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is not without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but in his own country, and in his own house, and among his own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">kindred</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he could not do any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> there, only that he cured a few that were sick, laying his hands upon them. <span class="stiki"><strong>He could not...</strong> Not for want of power, but because he would not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in favour of obstinate and incredulous people, who were unworthy of such favours.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he wondered because of their unbelief, and he went through the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> round about teaching.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he called the twelve; and began to send them two and two, and gave them power over <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, but a staff only; no scrip, no bread, nor money in their purse,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But to be shod with sandals, and that they should not put on two coats.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to them: Wheresoever you shall enter into an house, there abide till you depart from that place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you; going forth from thence, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And going forth they preached <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And they <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> many <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">anointed with oil</a> many that were sick, and healed them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">king Herod</a> heard, (for his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was made manifest), and he said: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> is <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">risen again from the dead</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">mighty works</a> show forth themselves in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And others said: It is <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>. But others said: It is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, as one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Which <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> hearing, said: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> whom I beheaded, he is <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">risen again from the dead</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> himself had sent and apprehended <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, and bound him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a> the wife of Philip his brother, because he had <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> said to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>: It is not <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">lawful</a> for thee to have thy brother's wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a> laid snares for him: and was desirous to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put him to death</a> and could not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> feared <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> him to be a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and kept him, and when he heard him, did many things: and he heard him willingly. <span class="stiki"><strong>And kept him...</strong> That is, from the designs of <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>; and for fear of the people, would not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put him to death</a>, though she sought it; and through her daughter she effected her wish.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when a convenient day was come, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> made a supper for his birthday, for the princes, and tribunes, and chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/13403a.htm">daughter</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a> had come in, and had <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">danced</a>, and pleased <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and them that were at table with him, the king said to the damsel: Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to her: Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee, though it be the half of my kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Who when she was gone out, said to her mother, What shall I ask? But her mother said: The head of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying: I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish, the head of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the king was struck sad. Yet because of his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and because of them that were with him at table, he would not displease her:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But sending an executioner, he commanded that his head should be brought in a dish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he beheaded him in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and brought his head in a dish: and gave to the damsel, and the damsel gave it her mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Which his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> hearing came, and took his body, and laid it in a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> coming together unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, related to him all things that they had done and taught.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he said to them: Come apart into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a>, and rest a little. For there were many coming and going: and they had not so much as time to eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And going up into a ship, they went into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a> apart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they saw them going away, and many <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>: and they ran flocking thither foot from all the cities, and were there before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> going out saw a great multitude: and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when the day was now far spent, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to him, saying: This is a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a>, and the hour is now past:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Send them away, that going into the next <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> and towns, they may buy themselves meat to eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And he answering said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said to him: Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence, and we will give them to eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And he saith to them: How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, they say: Five, and two fishes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes: looking up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, and broke the loaves, and gave to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to set before them: and the two fishes he divided among them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And they all did eat, and had their fill.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And they took up the leavings, twelve full baskets of fragments, and of the fishes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And they that did eat, were five thousand men.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And immediately he obliged his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to go up into the ship, that they might go before him over the water to <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a>, whilst he dismissed the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And when he had dismissed them, he went up to the mountain to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them), and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition, and they cried out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> For they all saw him, and were troubled bled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them: Have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> heart, it is I, fear ye not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were far more astonished within themselves:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And when they had passed over, they came into the <a href="../cathen/06415a.htm">land of Genezareth</a>, and set to the shore.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</span></p>
