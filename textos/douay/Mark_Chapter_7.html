<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots and of brazen vessels and of beds.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to them: Well do you make void the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandment of God</a>, that you may keep your own tradition.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a>, came in and fell down at his feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, a Syrophenician born.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But she answered and said to him: Yea, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he said to her: For this saying, go thy way. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is gone out of thy daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed and that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was gone out.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And again going out of the coasts of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, he came by <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">sea of Galilee</a>, through the midst of the coasts of <a href="../cathen/04664b.htm">Decapolis</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they bring to him one deaf and dumb: and they besought him that he would <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">lay his hand</a> upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears: and spitting, he touched his tongue.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And looking up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he groaned and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And immediately his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And he charged them that they should tell no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well. He hath made both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.</span></p>
