<h1>Mark Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ feeds four thousand. He gives sight to a blind man. He foretells his passion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In those days again, when there was great multitude and they had nothing to eat; calling his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> together, he saith to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And if I shall send them away <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to their home, they will faint in the way: for some of them came from afar off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> answered him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground. And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke and gave to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for to set before them. And they set them before the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they had a few little fishes: and he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them and commanded them to be set before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they did eat and were filled: and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they that had eaten were about four thousand. And he sent them away.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And immediately going up into a ship with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he came into the parts of <a href="../cathen/09523a.htm">Dalmanutha</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> came forth and began to question with him, asking him a sign from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, tempting him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And sighing deeply in spirit, he saith: Why doth this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> seek a sign? <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, I say to you, a sign shall not be given to this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And leaving them, he went up again into the ship and passed to the other side of the water.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they forgot to take bread: and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he charged them saying: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and of the leaven of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they reasoned among themselves, saying: Because we have no bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a>, saith to them: Why do you reason, because you have no bread? Do you not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nor understand? Have you still your heart blinded?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Having eyes, see you not? And having ears, hear you not? Neither do you remember?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> When I broke the five <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loves</a> among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They say to him: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Twelve<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> When also the seven loaves among four thousand, how many baskets of fragments took you up? And they say to him: Seven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he said to them: How do you not yet understand?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they came to <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a>: and they bring to him a blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And they besought him that he would touch him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And taking the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by the hand, he led him out of the town. And spitting upon his eyes, laying his hands on him, he asked him if he saw any thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And looking up, he said: I see <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as it were trees, walking.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> After that again he <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laid his hands</a> upon his eyes: and he began to see and was restored, so that he saw all things clearly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he sent him into his house, saying: Go into thy house, and if thou enter into the town, tell nobody.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went out, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> into the towns of <a href="../cathen/03135a.htm">Caesarea Philippi</a>. And in the way, he asked his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, saying to them: Whom do <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> say that I am?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Who answered him, saying: <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>; but some <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and others as one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then he saith to them: But whom do you say that I am? <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> answering said to him: Thou art the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he strictly charged them that they should not tell any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he began to teach them that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must suffer many things and be rejected by the ancients and by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>: and be killed and after three days <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he spoke the word openly. And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> taking him began to rebuke him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Who turning about and seeing his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, threatened <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, saying: Go behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, because thou savourest not the things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but that are of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And calling the multitude together with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he said to them: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will follow me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> shall save it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For what shall it profit a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Or what shall a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> give in exchange for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>: the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> also will be ashamed of him, when he shall come in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he said to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you that there are some of them that stand here who shall not taste death till they see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> coming in power.</span></p>
