<div class="h1a">Christ is transfigured. He casts out the dumb spirit. He teaches humility and to avoid scandal.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after six days, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> taketh with him <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and James and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves, and was <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfigured</a> before them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller upon earth can make white.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And there appeared to them <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: and they were talking with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> answering, said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: Rabbi, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here. And let us make three <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->tabernacles<!--</a>-->, one for thee, and one for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and one for <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what he said: for they were struck with fear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And there was a cloud overshadowing them. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my most beloved Son. Hear ye him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And immediately looking about, they saw no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> any more, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> only with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them not to tell any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> what things they had seen, till the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again from the dead</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they kept the word to themselves; questioning together what that should mean, when he shall be risen from the dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they asked him, saying: Why then do the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> say that <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> must come first?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who answering, said to then: <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, when he shall come first, shall restore all things; and as it is written of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> that he must suffer many things and be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But I say to you that <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> also is come (and they have done to him whatsoever they would), as it is written of him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And coming to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> he saw a great multitude about them and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> disputing with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And presently all the people, seeing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, were astonished and struck with fear: and running to him, they saluted him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he asked them: What do you question about among you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And one of the multitude, answering, said: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, I have brought my son to thee, having a dumb spirit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Who, wheresoever he taketh him, dasheth him: and he foameth and gnasheth with the teeth and pineth away. And I spoke to thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to cast him out: and they could not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Who answering them, said: O incredulous <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they brought him. And when he had seen him, immediately the spirit troubled him and being thrown down upon the ground, he rolled about foaming.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he asked his father: How long time is it since this hath happened unto him? But he sad: From his infancy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any thing, help us, having compassion on us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: If thou canst <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, all things are possible to him that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And immediately the father of the boy crying out, with tears said: I do <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->. Help my unbelief.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saw the multitude running together, he threatened the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a>, saying to him: Deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, go out of him and enter not any more into him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And crying out and greatly tearing him, he went our of him. And he became as dead, so that many said: He is dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> taking him by the hand, lifted him up. And he arose.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when he was come into the house, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> secretly asked him: Why could not we cast him out?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing, but by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And departing from thence, they passed through <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>: and he would not that any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he taught his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and said to them: The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed into the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a> the third day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But they understood not the word: and they were afraid to ask him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And they came to <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>. And when they were in the house, he asked them: What did you treat of in the way?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> But they held their peace, for in the way they had disputed among themselves, which of them should be the greatest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And sitting down, he called the twelve and saith to them: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> desire to be first, he shall be the last of all and be minister of all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them. Whom when he had embraced, he saith to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> receiveth me. And whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> answered him, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Master<!--</a>-->, we saw one casting out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, who followeth not us: and we forbade him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: Do not forbid him. For there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that doth a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and can soon speak ill of me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> For he that is not against you is for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, because you belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a> I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> one of these little ones that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me: it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And if thy hand <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life, maimed, than having two hands to go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, into unquenchable fire:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And if thy foot <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter lame into life everlasting than having two feet to be cast into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell of unquenchable fire</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And if thy eye <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee with one eye to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> than having two eyes to be cast into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell of fire</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> For every one shall be salted with fire: and every victim shall be salted with <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>.</span>
