<h1>Matthew</h1>

<h2>The Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to St. Matthew</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">Saint Matthew</a>, one of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, who from being a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, that is, a taxgatherer, was called by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a>: in that profession his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is Levi. (<a href="../douay/luk005.htm#verse27">Luke 5:27</a>, and <a href="../douay/mar002.htm#verse14">Mark 2:14</a>.) He was the first of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> that wrote the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and that in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> or Syro-Chaldaic which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Palestine spoke at that time. The original is not now extant; but it was translated in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> into Greek, that version was of equal authority. He wrote about six years after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Lord's Ascension</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">GOSPEL OF MATTHEW</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/mat001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> The genealogy of Christ: he is conceived and born of a virgin.
<br><a href="../douay/mat002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> The offerings of the wise men: the flight into Egypt: the massacre of the Innocents.
<br><a href="../douay/mat003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> The preaching of John: Christ is baptized.
<br><a href="../douay/mat004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Christ's fast of forty days: He is tempted. He begins to preach, to call disciples to him, and to work miracles.
<br><a href="../douay/mat005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> Christ's sermon upon the mount. The eight beatitudes.
<br><a href="../douay/mat006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> A continuation of the sermon on the mount.
<br><a href="../douay/mat007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> The third part of the sermon on the mount.
<br><a href="../douay/mat008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> Christ cleanses the leper, heals the centurion's servant, Peter's mother-in-law, and many others: he stills the storm at sea, drives the devils out of two men possessed, and suffers them to go into the swine.
<br><a href="../douay/mat009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> Christ heals one sick of palsy: calls Matthew: cures the issue of blood: raises to life the daughter of Jairus: gives sight to two blind men: and heals a dumb man possessed by the devil.
<br><a href="../douay/mat010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> Christ sends out his twelve apostles, with the power of miracles. The lessons he gives them.
<br><a href="../douay/mat011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> John sends his disciples to Christ, who upbraids the Jews for their incredulity, and calls to him such as are sensible of their burdens.
<br><a href="../douay/mat012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> Christ reproves the blindness of the Pharisees, and confutes their attributing his miracles to Satan.
<br><a href="../douay/mat013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> The parables of the sower and the cockle: of the mustard seed, etc.
<br><a href="../douay/mat014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> Herod puts John to death. Christ feeds five thousand in the desert. He walks upon the sea, and heals all the diseased with the touch of his garment.
<br><a href="../douay/mat015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> Christ reproves the Scribes. He cures the daughter of the woman of Canaan: and many others: and feeds four thousand with seven loaves.
<br><a href="../douay/mat016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> Christ refuses to show the Pharisees a sign from heaven. Peter's confession is rewarded. He is rebuked for opposing Christ's passion. All his followers must deny themselves.
<br><a href="../douay/mat017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> The Transfiguration of Christ: He cures the lunatic child: foretells his passion; and pays the didrachma.
<br><a href="../douay/mat018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> Christ teaches humility, to beware of scandal, and to flee the occasions of sin: to denounce to the church incorrigible sinners, and to look upon such as refuse to hear the church as heathens. He promises to his disciples the power of binding and loosing: and that he will be in the midst of their assemblies. No forgiveness for them that will not forgive.
<br><a href="../douay/mat019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> Christ declares matrimony to be indissoluble: he recommends the making one's self an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven; and parting with all things for him. He shows the danger of riches, and the reward of leaving all to follow him.
<br><a href="../douay/mat020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> The parable of the labourers in the vineyard. The ambition of the two sons of Zebedee. Christ gives sight to two blind men.
<br><a href="../douay/mat021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> Christ rides into Jerusalem upon an ass. He casts the buyers and sellers out of the temple, curses the fig tree and puts to silence the priests and scribes.
<br><a href="../douay/mat022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> The parable of the marriage feast. Christ orders tribute to be paid to Caesar. He confutes the Sadducees, shows which is the first commandment in the law and puzzles the Pharisees.
<br><a href="../douay/mat023.htm"><strong>Chapter 23.</strong></a> Christ admonishes the people to follow the good doctrine, not the bad example of the scribes and Pharisees. He warns his disciples not to imitate their ambition and denounces divers woes against them for their hypocrisy and blindness.
<br><a href="../douay/mat024.htm"><strong>Chapter 24.</strong></a> Christ foretells the destruction of the temple, with the signs that shall come before it and before the last judgment. We must always watch.
<br><a href="../douay/mat025.htm"><strong>Chapter 25.</strong></a> The parable of the ten virgins and of the talents. The description of the last judgment.
<br><a href="../douay/mat026.htm"><strong>Chapter 26.</strong></a> The Jews conspire against Christ. He is anointed by Mary. The treason of Judas. The last supper. The prayer in the garden. The apprehension of our Lord. His treatment in the house of Caiphas.
<br><a href="../douay/mat027.htm"><strong>Chapter 27.</strong></a> The continuation of the history of the passion of Christ. His death and burial.
<br><a href="../douay/mat028.htm"><strong>Chapter 28.</strong></a> The resurrection of Christ. His commission to his disciples.
