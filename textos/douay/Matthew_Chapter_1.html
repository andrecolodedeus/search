<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in this wise.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Whereupon <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph her husband</a>, being a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not willing publicly to expose her, was minded to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put her away</a> privately.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But while he thought on these things, behold the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angel of the Lord</a> appeared to him in his sleep, saying: <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, fear not to take unto thee <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And she shall bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">Jesus</a>. For he shall save his people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke by the <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">prophet</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Behold a <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">virgin</a> shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which being interpreted is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> rising up from sleep, did as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> had commanded him, and took unto him his wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he knew her not till she brought forth her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first born son</a>: and he called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">Jesus</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Till she brought forth her firstborn son...</strong> From these words Helvidius and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> most impiously inferred that the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">blessed Virgin Mary</a> had other children besides <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> shows, by divers examples, that this expression of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> was a manner of speaking usual among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, to denote by the word <em>until</em>, only what is done, without any regard to the future. Thus it is said, <a href="../douay/gen008.htm#verse6">Genesis 8:6</a> and <a href="../douay/gen008.htm#verse7">8:7</a>, that <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> sent forth a raven, which went forth, and did not return till the waters were dried up on the earth. That is, did not return any more. Also <a href="../douay/isa046.htm#verse4">Isaias 46:4</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> says: I am till you grow old. Who dare infer that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should then cease to be: Also in the <a href="../douay/1ma005.htm#verse54">1 Maccabees 5:54</a>, And they went up to mount Sion with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy and gladness</a>, and offered <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, because not one of them was slain till they had returned in peace. That is, not one was slain before or after they had returned. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saith to his <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">divine Son</a>: Sit on my right hand till I make thy enemies thy footstool. Shall he sit no longer after his enemies are subdued? Yea and for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> also proves by <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> examples, that an only begotten son, was also called <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, or first begotten: because according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> males were to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; Sanctify unto me, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, every <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> that openeth the womb among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, etc. <a href="../douay/exo013.htm#verse2">Exodus 13:2</a>.</span></span></p>
