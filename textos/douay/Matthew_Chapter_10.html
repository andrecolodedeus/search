<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Do not think that I came to send peace upon earth: I came not to send peace, but the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> For I came to set a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. <span class="stiki"><strong>I came to set a man at variance, etc...</strong> Not that this was the end or design of the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>; but that his coming and his doctrine would have this effect, by reason of the obstinate resistance that many would make, and of their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> all such as should adhere to him.</span></span>
