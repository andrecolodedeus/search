<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> seeing them, said to him: Behold thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> do that which is not lawful to do on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But he said to them: Have you not read what <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> did when he was hungry, and they that were with him:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Or have ye not read in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, that on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> break the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and are without blame?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But I tell you that there is here a greater than the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what this meaneth: I will have <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">mercy</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>: you would never have condemned the innocent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is Lord even of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when he had passed from thence, he came into their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And behold there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a>? that they might accuse him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But he said to them: What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall there be among you, that hath one sheep: and if the same fall into a pit on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>, will he not take hold on it and lift it up?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> How much better is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do a good deed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath days</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then he saith to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: Stretch forth thy hand; and he stretched it forth, and it was restored to health even as the other.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> going out made a consultation against him, how they might <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">destroy</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> it, retired from thence: and many followed him, and he healed them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he charged them that they should not make him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a>, saying:</span></p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He shall not contend, nor cry out, neither shall any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hear his voice in the streets.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And in his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall hope.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then was offered to him one <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, blind and dumb: and he healed him, so that he spoke and saw.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And all the multitudes were amazed, and said: Is not this the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">son of David</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> hearing it, said: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">casteth</a> not out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> but by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> the prince of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate: and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And if <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, he is divided against himself: how then shall his kingdom stand?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And if I by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, by whom do your children <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast them out</a>?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But if I by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, then is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> come upon you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong, and rifle his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>, unless he first bind the strong? and then he will rifle his house.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Therefore I say to you: Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> shall not be forgiven. <span class="stiki"><strong>The blasphemy of the Spirit...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> here spoken of is that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> attributed the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, wrought by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> the prince of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world, nor in the world to come. <span class="stiki"><strong>Nor in the world to come...</strong> From these words <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (De Civ.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Either make the tree <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and its fruit <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: or make the tree <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and its fruit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> O <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> of vipers, how can you speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, whereas you are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> out of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> treasure bringeth forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things: and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> out of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure bringeth forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But I say unto you, that every idle word that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall speak, they shall render an account for it in the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Every idle word...</strong> This shows there must be a <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">place of temporal punishment</a> hereafter where these slighter faults shall be punished.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, and shall condemn it: because they did <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> at the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08497b.htm">Jonah</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> The queen of the <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">south</a> shall rise in judgment with this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, and shall condemn it: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and behold a greater than <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And when an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a> is gone out of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> he walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Then he saith: I will return into my house from whence I came out. And coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirits</a> more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made worse than the first.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother</a> and his <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren</a> stood without, seeking to speak to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And one said unto him: Behold thy <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">mother</a> and thy <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren</a> stand without, seeking thee.</span>
