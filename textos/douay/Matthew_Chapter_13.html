<div class="h1a">The parables of the sower and the cockle: of the mustard seed, etc.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The same day <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> going out of the house, sat by the sea side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a boat and sat: and all the multitude stood on the shore.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he spoke to them many things in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, saying: Behold the sower went forth to sow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And whilst he soweth some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate them up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And other some fell upon stony ground, where they had not much earth: and they sprung up immediately, because they had no deepness of earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when the sun was up they were scorched: and because they had not root, they withered away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And others fell among thorns: and the thorns grew up and choked them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And others fell upon <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ground: and they brought forth fruit, some an hundred fold, some sixty fold, and some thirty fold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came and said to him: Why speakest thou to them in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who answered and said to them: Because to you it is given to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: but to them it is not given.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For he that hath, to him shall be given, and he shall abound: but he that hath not, from him shall be taken away that also which he hath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Therefore do I speak to them in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>: because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a> is fulfilled in them, who saith:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand: and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears they have been dull of hearing, and their eyes they have shut: lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and I should heal them.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, I say to you, many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them: and to hear the things that you hear and have not heard them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Hear you therefore the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the sower.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> When any one heareth the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word of the kingdom</a>, and understandeth it not, there cometh the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">wicked one</a>, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart: this is he that received the seed by the way side.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he that received the seed upon stony ground, is he that heareth the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>, and immediately receiveth it with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Yet hath he not root in himself, but is only for a time: and when there ariseth tribulation and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> because of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>, he is presently <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he that received the seed among thorns, is he that heareth the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>, and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">riches</a> choketh up the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>, and he becometh fruitless.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he that received the seed upon <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ground, is he that heareth the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">word</a>, and understandeth, and beareth fruit, and yieldeth the one an hundredfold, and another sixty, and another thirty.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Another <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> he proposed to them, saying: The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is likened to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that sowed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> seed in his field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But while <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were asleep, his enemy came and oversowed cockle among the wheat and went his way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when the blade was sprung up, and had brought forth fruit, then appeared also the cockle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the servants of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of the house coming said to him. Sir, didst thou not sow <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> seed in thy field? Whence then hath it cockle?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And he said to them: An enemy hath done this. And the servants said to him: Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he said: No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Another <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> he proposed unto them, saying: The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> took and sowed in his field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Another <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> he spoke to them: The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like to leaven, which a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> All these things <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> to the multitudes: and without <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> he did not speak to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying: I will open my mouth in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Then having sent away the multitudes, he came into the house, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to him, saying: Expound to us the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the cockle of the field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Who made answer and said to them: He that soweth the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> seed is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And the field is the world. And the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> seed are the children of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>. And the cockle are the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">wicked one</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And the enemy that sowed them, is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But the harvest is the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>. And the reapers are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Even as cockle therefore is gathered up, and burnt with fire: so shall it be at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall send his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and they shall gather out of his <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> all <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>, and them that work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And shall cast them into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">furnace of fire</a>: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Then shall the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> shine as the sun, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of their Father</a>. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like unto a treasure hidden in a field. Which a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> having found, hid it, and for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Again the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like to a merchant seeking <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> pearls.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Who when he had found one pearl of great price, went his way, and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> Again the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like to a net cast into the sea, and gathering together of all kinds of fishes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> Which, when it was filled, they drew out, and sitting by the shore, they chose out the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> into vessels, but the bad they cast forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> So shall it be at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall go out, and shall separate the wicked from among the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And shall cast them into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">furnace of fire</a>: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> Have ye understood all these things? They say to him: Yes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> He said unto them: Therefore every <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a> instructed in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, is like to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And it came to pass: when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had finished these <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, he passed from thence.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And coming into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">his own country</a>, he taught them in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, so that they wondered and said: How came this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by this wisdom and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> Is not this the <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">carpenter's</a> son? Is not his mother called <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren</a> <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">James</a>, and Joseph, and <a href="../cathen/13796b.htm">Simon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>His brethren...</strong> These were the children of <a href="../cathen/09748b.htm">Mary the wife of Cleophas</a>, sister to our <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Lady</a>, (<a href="../douay/mat027.htm#verse56">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="../douay/joh019.htm#verse25">John 19:25</a>), and therefore, according to the usual style of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, they were called <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brethren</a>, that is, near relations to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> And his <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">sisters</a>, are they not all with us? Whence therefore hath he all these things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And they were <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> in his regard. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is not without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And he wrought not many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> there, because of their unbelief.</span></p>
