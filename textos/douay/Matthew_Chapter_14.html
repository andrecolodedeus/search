<div class="h1a">Herod puts John to death. Christ feeds five thousand in the desert. He walks upon the sea, and heals all the diseased with the touch of his garment.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> At that time <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Tetrarch</a> heard the fame of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Tetrarch...</strong> This word, derived from the Greek, signifies one that rules over the fourth part of a kingdom: as <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> then ruled over <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, which was but the fourth part of the kingdom of his father.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said to his servants: This is <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>: he is <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">risen from the dead</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">mighty works</a> show forth themselves in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> had apprehended <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> and bound him, and put him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, because of <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>, his brother's wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> said to him: It is not lawful for thee to have her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And having a mind to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put him to death</a>, he feared the people: because they esteemed him as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But on <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> birthday, the <a href="../cathen/13403a.htm">daughter of Herodias</a> <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">danced</a> before them: and pleased <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Whereupon he promised with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But she being instructed before by her mother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the king was struck sad: yet because of his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he sent, and beheaded <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> in the prison.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And his head was brought in a dish: and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came and took the body, and buried it, and came and told <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Which when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had heard, he retired from thence by a boat, into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a> apart, and the multitudes having heard of it, followed him on foot out of the cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he coming forth saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when it was evening, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to him, saying: This is a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a>, and the hour is now past: send away the multitudes, that going into the towns, they may buy themselves victuals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them, They have no need to go: give you them to eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> They answered him: We have not here, but five loaves, and two fishes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Who said to them: Bring them hither to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And when he had commanded the multitude to sit down upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, and brake, and gave the loaves to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to the multitudes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they did all eat, and were filled. And they took up what remained, twelve full baskets of fragments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the number of them that did eat, was five thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, besides <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And forthwith <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> obliged his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to go up into the boat, and to go before him over the water, till he dismissed the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And having dismissed the multitude, he went into a mountain alone to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. And when it was evening, he was there alone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves: for the wind was contrary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking upon the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they seeing him walking upon the sea, were troubled, saying: It is an <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a>. And they cried out for fear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And immediately <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke to them, saying: Be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> heart: it is I, fear ye not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> making answer, said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he said: Come. And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> going down out of the boat walked upon the water to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and when he began to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And immediately <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> stretching forth his hand took hold of him, and said to him: O thou of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, why didst thou <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when they were come up into the boat, the wind ceased.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they that were in the boat came and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him, saying: Indeed thou art the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And having passed the water, they came into the <a href="../cathen/06415a.htm">country of Genesar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of that place had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him, they sent into all that country, and brought to him all that were diseased.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And they besought him that they might touch but the <a href="../cathen/06307b.htm">hem of his garment</a>. And as many as touched, were made whole.</span></p>
