<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then came to him from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Why do thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> transgress the tradition of the ancients? For they <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash not their hands</a> when they eat bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandment of God</a> for your tradition? For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">Honour</a> thy <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>: And: He that shall <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father or mother</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">die the death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But you say: Whosoever shall say to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father or mother</a>, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee. <span class="stiki"><strong>The gift, etc...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> that I shall make to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall be instead of that which should be expended for thy profit. This tradition of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> was calculated to enrich themselves; by exempting children from giving any further assistance to their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, if they once offered to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that which should have been the support of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. But this was a violation of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">nature</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a> here condemns.</span></span>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And in vain do they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worship</a> me, teaching doctrines and commandments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Commandments of men...</strong> The doctrines and commandments here reprehended are such as are either contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, (as that of neglecting <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, under pretence of giving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>), or at least are frivolous, unprofitable, and no ways conducing to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> piety, as that of often <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washing hands</a>, etc., without regard to the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">purity of the heart</a>. But as to the <a href="../cathen/04154a.htm">rules and ordinances of the holy church</a>, touching <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festivals</a>, etc., these are no ways repugnant to, but highly agreeable to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">God's holy word</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> piety: neither are they to be counted among the doctrines and commandments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; because they proceed not from mere <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">human authority</a>; but from that which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has established in his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>; whose <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> he has commanded us to hear and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, even as himself. <a href="../douay/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke 10:16</a>; <a href="../douay/mat018.htm#verse17">Matthew 18:17</a>.</span></span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Not that which goeth into, etc...</strong> No <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> in meat, nor any dirt contracted by eating it with unwashed hands, can defile the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone; or a disobedience of the heart to the ordinance and <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus when <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> took the forbidden fruit, it was not the apple, which entered into the mouth, but the disobedience to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a> which defiled him. The same is to be said if a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, in the time of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">old law</a>, had eaten swine's flesh; or a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a>, in the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, contrary to their ordinance, had eaten blood; or if any of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> at present should transgress the <a href="../cathen/04154a.htm">ordinance of God's church</a>, by breaking the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>: for in all these cases the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be defiled; not indeed by that which goeth into the mouth; but by the disobedience of the heart, in wilfully transgressing the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">ordinance of God</a>, or of those who have their authority from him.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then came his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and said to him: Dost thou <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, when they heard this word, were <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But he answering, said: Every plant which my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">heavenly Father</a> hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the pit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> answering, said to him: Expound to us this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But he said: Are you also yet without understanding?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">heart</a>, and those things defile a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">heart</a> come forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adulteries</a>, fornications, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thefts</a>, <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">false testimonies</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went from thence, and retired into the coast of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and <a href="../cathen/13776a.htm">Sidon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And behold a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaan</a> who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">son of David</a>: my daughter is <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">grievously troubled</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Who answered her not a word. And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she crieth after us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he answering, said: I was not sent but to the sheep, that are lost of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But she came and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him, saying: Lord, help me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Who answering, said: It is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to her: O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, great is thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from that hour.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had passed away from thence, he came nigh the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">sea of Galilee</a>: and going up into a mountain, he sat there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others: and they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk, the blind see: and they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> called together his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and said: I have compassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, lest they faint in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> say unto him: Whence then should we have so many loaves in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, as to fill so great a multitude?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: How many loaves have you? But they said: Seven, and a few little fishes.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> gave to the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And they did all eat, and had their fill. And they took up seven baskets full, of what remained of the fragments.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and came into the coasts of <a href="../cathen/09523a.htm">Magedan</a>.</span></p>
