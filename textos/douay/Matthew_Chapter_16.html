<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And there came to him the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> tempting: and they asked him to show them a sign from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But he answered and said to them: When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And in the morning: Today there will be a storm, for the sky is red and lowering. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> then how to discern the face of the sky: and can you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the signs of the times?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> A <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and adulterous <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> seeketh after a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. And he left them, and went away.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were come over the water, they had forgotten to take bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Who said to them: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But they thought within themselves, saying: Because we have taken no bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> it, said: Why do you think within yourselves, O ye of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for that you have no bread?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Do you not yet understand, neither do you remember the five loaves among five thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and how many baskets you took up?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Nor the seven loaves, among four thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and how many baskets you took up?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Why do you not understand that it was not concerning bread I said to you: Beware of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then they understood that he said not that they should beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came into the quarters of <a href="../cathen/03135a.htm">Caesarea Philippi</a>: and he asked his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, saying: Whom do <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> say that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But they said: Some <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, and other some <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and others <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah</a>, or one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: But whom do you say that I am?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a> answered and said: Thou art <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the living God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering said to him: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> art thou, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Bar-Jona</a>: because flesh and blood hath not <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> it to thee, but my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I say to thee: That thou art <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>; and upon this <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">rock</a> I will build my <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thou art Peter, etc...</strong> As <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divine revelation</a>, here made a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> profession of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; so in recompense of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and profession, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> here declares to him the dignity to which he is pleased to raise him: viz., that he to whom he had already given the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <em>Peter</em>, signifying a rock, <a href="../douay/joh001.htm#verse42">John 1:42</a>, should be a rock indeed, of invincible strength, for the support of the building of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>; in which building he should be, next to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself, the chief foundation stone, in quality of chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, ruler, and governor; and should have accordingly all fulness of ecclesiastical power, signified by the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">keys of the kingdom of heaven</a>. <strong>Upon this rock, etc...</strong> The words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, spoken in the vulgar language of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> made use of, were the same as if he had said in English, <em>Thou art a Rock, and upon this rock I will build my <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a></em>. So that, by the plain course of the words, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> is here declared to be the rock, upon which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> was to be built: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself being both the principal foundation and founder of the same. Where also note, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by building his house, that is, his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, upon a rock, has thereby secured it against all storms and floods, like the wise builder, <a href="../douay/mat007.htm#verse24">Matthew 7:24-25</a>. <strong>The gates of hell, etc...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">powers of darkness</a>, and whatever <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> can do, either by himself, or his agents. For as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> is here likened to a house, or fortress, built on a rock; so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">adverse powers</a> are likened to a contrary house or fortress, the gates of which, that is, the whole strength, and all the efforts it can make, will never be able to prevail over the city or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of Christ</a>. By this <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> we are fully assured, that neither <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, nor any pernicious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> whatsoever shall at any time prevail over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of Christ</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I will give to thee the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">keys of the kingdom of heaven</a>. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Loose on earth...</strong> The loosing the bands of temporal punishments due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is called an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>; the power of which is here granted.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Then he commanded his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they should tell no one that he was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> From that time <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to show to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that he must go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and suffer many things from the ancients and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and the third day <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> taking him, began to rebuke him, saying: Lord, be it far from thee, this shall not be unto thee. <span class="stiki"><strong>And Peter taking him...</strong> That is, taking him aside, out of a tender <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, respect and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for his <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord and Master's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, began to expostulate with him, as it were to rebuke him, saying, <em>Lord, far be it from thee to suffer death</em>; but the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, <a href="../douay/mat016.htm#verse23">verse 23</a>, Go behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. These words may signify, <em>Begone from me</em>; but the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">holy Fathers</a> expound them otherwise, that is, come after me, or follow me; and by these words the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> would have <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> to follow him in his suffering, and not to oppose the divine <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by contradiction; for the word <em>satan</em> means in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> an adversary, or one that opposes.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Who turning, said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: Go behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, thou art a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> unto me: because thou savourest not the things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the things that are of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will come after me, let him <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">deny himself</a>, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For he that will save his life, shall lose it: and he that shall lose his life for my sake, shall find it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For what doth it profit a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?
