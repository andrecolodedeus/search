<div class="h1a">The Transfiguration of Christ: He cures the lunatic child: foretells his passion; and pays the didrachma.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after six days <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> taketh unto him <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he was <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">transfigured</a> before them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And behold there appeared to them <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> talking with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> answering, said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: Lord, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and one for <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> hearing fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came and touched them: and said to them: Arise, and fear not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they lifting up their eyes, saw no one, but only <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And as they came down from the mountain, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, till the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen from the dead</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> asked him, saying: Why then do the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> say that <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> must come first?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But he answering, said to them: <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> indeed shall come, and restore all things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But I say to you, that <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> is already come, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall suffer from them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> understood, that he had spoken to them of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> falling down on his knees before him saying: Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">lunatic</a>, and suffereth much: for he falleth often into the fire, and often into the water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I brought him to thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and they could not cure him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> rebuked him, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then came the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> secretly, and said: Why could not we cast him out?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: Because of your unbelief. For, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a> I say to you, if you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain: Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible to you. <span class="stiki"><strong>As a grain of mustard seed...</strong> That is, a perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; which in its properties, and its fruits, resembles the grain of mustard seed, in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, <a href="../douay/mat013.htm#verse31">Matthew 13:31</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But this kind is not <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> but by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when they abode together in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed into the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they shall <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him, and the third day he shall <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>. And they were troubled exceedingly.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when they were come to <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, they that received the didrachmas, came to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and said to him: Doth not your master pay the didrachmas? <span class="stiki"><strong>The didrachmas...</strong> A didrachma was half a sicle, or half a stater; that is, about 15d. English: which was a tax laid upon every head for the service of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He said: Yes. And when he was come into the house, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> prevented him, saying: What is thy opinion, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon</a>? The kings of the earth, of whom do they receive tribute or custom, of their own children, or of strangers?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And he said: Of strangers. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Then the children are free.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But that we may not <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook: and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened it's mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee.</span></p>
