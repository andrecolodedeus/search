<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> At that hour the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, saying: Who, thinkest thou, is the greater in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, calling unto him a little child, set him in the midst of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a> I say to you, unless you be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Whosoever therefore shall <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself as this little child, he is the greater in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he that shall receive one such little child in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, receiveth me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But he that shall <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> one of these little ones that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me, it were better for him that a millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea. <span class="stiki"><strong>Shall scandalize...</strong> That is, shall put a stumbling block in their way, and cause them to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Woe to the world because of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And if thy hand, or thy foot, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> See that you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> not one of these little ones: for I say to you, that <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">their angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> always <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">see the face</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> What think you? If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have an hundred sheep, and one of them should go astray: doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and goeth to seek that which is gone astray?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And if it so be that he find it: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, he rejoiceth more for that, than for the ninety-nine that went not astray.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Even so it is not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, that one of these little ones should perish.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But if thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more: that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And if he will not hear them: tell the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. And if he will not hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, let him be to thee as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Again I say to you, that if two of you shall consent upon earth, concerning anything whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be done to them by my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For where there are two or three gathered together in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, there am I in the midst of them. <span class="stiki"><strong>There am I in the midst of them...</strong> This is understood of such assemblies only as are gathered in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and in <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, De Unitate Ecclesiae.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then came <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> unto him and said: Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven times.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Therefore is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> likened to a king, who would take an account of his servants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And when he had begun to take the account, one was brought to him, that owed him ten thousand talents. <span class="stiki"><strong>Talents...</strong> A talent was seven hundred and fifty ounces of silver, which at the rate of five shillings to the ounce is a hundred and eighty-seven pounds ten shillings sterling.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And as he had not wherewith to pay it, his lord commanded that he should be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But that servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the lord of that servant being moved with pity, let him go and forgave him the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But when that servant was gone out, he found one of his fellow-servants that owed him an hundred pence: and laying hold of him, he throttled him, saying: Pay what thou owest. <span class="stiki"><strong>Pence...</strong> The Roman penny was the eighth part of an ounce, that is, about sevenpence half-penny English.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And his fellow-servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And he would not: but went and cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, till he paid the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much grieved, and they came, and told their lord all that was done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Then his lord called him: and said to him: Thou <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servant, I forgave thee all the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, because thou besoughtest me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Shouldst not thou then have had compassion also on thy fellow servant, even as I had compassion on thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And his lord being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, delivered him to the torturers until he paid all the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> So also shall my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">heavenly Father</a> do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.</span></p>
