<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had ended these words, he departed from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and came into the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, beyond <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And great multitudes followed him: and he healed them there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And there came to him the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> tempting him, saying: Is it lawful for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife for every cause?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Who answering, said to them: Have ye not read, that he who made <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the beginning, made them male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>? And he said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For this cause shall a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> leave <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. What therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath joined together, let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put asunder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They say to him: Why then did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> command to give a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He saith to them: Because <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by reason of the hardness of your heart permitted you to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> your wives: but from the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">beginning</a> it was not so.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I say to you, that whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry another</a>, committeth <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: and he that shall <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> her that is <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a>, committeth <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Except it be, etc...</strong> In the case of fornication, that is, of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, the wife may be put away: but even then the husband cannot <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry another</a> as long as the wife is living.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> say unto him: If the case of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his wife be so, it is not expedient to <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who said to them: All <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> take not this word, but they to whom it is given. <span class="stiki"><strong>All men take not this word...</strong> That is, all receive not the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">living singly and chastely</a>, unless they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to enable them to live so, and for some it may be necessary to that end to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: and to those it is given from above.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For there are eunuchs, who were born so from their mothers womb: and there are eunuchs, who were made so by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and there are eunuchs, who have <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">made themselves eunuchs</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. He that can take, let him take it. <span class="stiki"><strong>There are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs, for the kingdom of heaven...</strong> This text is not to be taken in the literal sense; but means, that there are such, who have taken a firm and commendable resolution of leading a <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">single and chaste life</a>, in order to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a more <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> state than those who <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>: as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> clearly shows. <a href="../douay/1co007.htm#verse37">1 Corinthians 7:37-38</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then were little children presented to him, that he should <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">impose hands</a> upon them and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> rebuked them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me: for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is for such.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And when he had <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposed hands</a> upon them, he departed from thence.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And behold one came and said to him: <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a> master, what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> shall I do that I may have <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">life everlasting</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Who said to him: Why askest thou me concerning <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? One is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if thou wilt enter into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">life</a>, keep the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He said to him: Which? And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: Thou shalt do no <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, Thou shalt not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, Thou shalt not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>, Thou shalt not bear <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">false witness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">Honour</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">thy father and thy mother</a>: and, Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thy neighbor as thyself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The young man saith to him: All these have I kept from my youth, what is yet wanting to me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: If thou wilt be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>, go sell what thou hast, and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">give</a> to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and come, follow me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when the young man had heard this word, he went away sad: for he had great <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, I say to you, that a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall hardly enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when they had heard this, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> wondered much, saying: Who then can be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> beholding, said to them: With <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> this is impossible: but with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all things are possible.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Then <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> answering, said to him: Behold we have left all things, and have followed thee: what therefore shall we have?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, that you who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall sit on the seat of his majesty, you also shall sit on twelve seats judging the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">twelve tribes of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And every one that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">mother</a>, or wife, or children, or lands for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall possess <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">life everlasting</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And many that are first, shall be last: and the last shall be first.</span></p>
