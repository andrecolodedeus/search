<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Saying: Where is he that is born king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">king Herod</a> hearing this, was troubled, and all <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And assembling together all the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> of the people, he inquired of them where <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> should be born.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But they said to him: In <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem of Juda</a>. For so it is written by the <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">prophet</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And thou <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem the land of Juda</a> art not the least among the princes of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: for out of thee shall come forth the <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a> that shall rule my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></blockquote>
<span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, privately calling the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">wise men</a> learned diligently of them the time of the star which appeared to them;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And sending them into <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, said: Go and diligently inquire after the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they had seen in the East, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And entering into the house, they found the child with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> his mother, and falling down they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him: and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And having received an answer in <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">sleep</a> that they should not return to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, they went back another way into their country.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And after they were departed, behold an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> appeared <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">in sleep</a> to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a>, saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and fly into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and be there until I shall tell thee. For it will come to pass that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> will seek the child to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">destroy</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Who arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and retired into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and he was there until the death of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> That it might be fulfilled which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying: Out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have I called my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> perceiving that he was deluded by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">wise men</a>, was exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: and sending <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> all the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">menchildren</a> that were in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">wise men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and great mourning; <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a> bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</span></blockquote>
<span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was dead, behold an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> appeared <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">in sleep</a> to <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. For they are dead that sought the life of the child.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But hearing that Archelaus reigned in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> in the room of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> his father, he was afraid to go thither: and being warned <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">in sleep</a> retired into the quarters of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And coming he dwelt in a city called <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>: that it might be fulfilled which was said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: That he shall be called a <a href="../cathen/10724b.htm">Nazarene</a>.</span></p>
