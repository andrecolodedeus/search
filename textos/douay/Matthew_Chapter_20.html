<h1>Matthew Chapter 20</h1>
<div class="h1a">The parable of the labourers in the vineyard. The ambition of the two sons of Zebedee. Christ gives sight to two blind men.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like to an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And going out about the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, he saw others standing in the marketplace idle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they went their way. And again he went out about the <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a>, and did in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They say to him: Because no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath hired us. He saith to them: Go ye also into my vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> When therefore they were come that came about the eleventh hour, they received every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a penny.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: And they also received every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a penny.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Saying: These last have worked but one hour and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But he answering said to one of them: friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? Is thy eye <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because I am <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? <span class="stiki"><strong>What I will...</strong> Viz., with my own, and in matters that depend on my own bounty.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So shall the last be first and the first last. For many are <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">called</a> but few chosen.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> going up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, took the twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> apart and said to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Behold we go up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>: and they shall condemn him to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And shall deliver him to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to be mocked and scourged and crucified: and the third day he shall <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoring</a> and asking something of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what you ask. Can you drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> He saith to them: My <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the ten, hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> called them to him and said: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the princes of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> lord it over them; and that they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> It shall not be so among you: but whosoever is the greater among you, let him be your <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he that will be first among you shall be your servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Even as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> a <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> for many.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And when they went out from <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, a great multitude followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And behold two blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> sitting by the way side heard that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> passed by. And they cried out, saying: O Lord, thou <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">son of David</a>, have mercy on us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace. But they cried out the more, saying: O Lord, thou <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">son of David</a>, have mercy on us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> stood and called them and said: What will ye that I do to you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> They say to him: Lord, that our eyes be opened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> having compassion on them, touched their eyes. And immediately they saw and followed him.</span></p>
