<h1>Matthew Chapter 21</h1>
<div class="h1a">Christ rides into Jerusalem upon an ass. He casts the buyers and sellers out of the temple, curses the fig tree and puts to silence the priests and scribes.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when they drew nigh to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and were come to Bethphage, unto <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount Olivet</a>, then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> sent two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Saying to them: Go ye into the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">village</a> that is over against you: and immediately you shall find an ass tied and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall say anything to you, say ye that the Lord hath need of them. And forthwith he will let them go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Tell ye the daughter of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Sion</a>: Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt, the foal of her that is used to the yoke.</span></blockquote>
<span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> going, did as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> commanded them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they brought the ass and the colt and laid their garments upon them and made him sit thereon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way: and others cut boughs from the trees and strewed them in the way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the multitudes that went before and that followed cried, saying: <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">son of David</a>: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is he that cometh in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> in the highest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when he was come into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the whole city was moved, saying: Who is this?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the people said: This is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth of Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> and cast out all them that sold and bought in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the chairs of them that sold doves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he saith to them: It is written, My <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house</a> shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; but you have made it a den of thieves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And there came to him the blind and the lame in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and he healed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, seeing the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> and saying: <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">son of David</a>, were moved with indignation,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And said to him: Hearest thou what these say? And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: Yea, have you never read: Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">praise</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And leaving them, he went out of the city into <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a> and remained here.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And in the morning, returning into the city, he was hungry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And seeing a certain fig tree by the way side, he came to it and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he saith to it: May no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> seeing it wondered, saying: How is it presently withered away?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, I say to you, if you shall have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and stagger not, not only this of the fig tree shall you do, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Take up and cast thyself into the sea, it shall be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And all things whatsoever you shall ask in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, you shall receive.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when he was come into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, there came to him, as he was teaching, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ancients of the people, saying: By what authority dost thou these things? And who hath given thee this authority?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: I also will ask you one word, which if you shall tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, whence was it? From <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? But they thought within themselves, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> If we shall say, from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he will say to us: Why then did you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him? But if we shall say, from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, we are afraid of the multitude: for all held <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And answering <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, they said: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. He also said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But what think you? A certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had two sons: and coming to the first, he said: Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And he answering, said: I will not. But afterwards, being moved with <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a>, he went.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And coming to the other, he said in like manner. And he answering said: I go, Sir. And he went not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Which of the two did the father's will? They say to him: The first. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you that the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and the harlots shall go into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> before you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> For <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> came to you in the way of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and you did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him. But the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and the harlots <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him: but you, seeing it, did not even afterwards <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repent</a>, that you might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Hear ye another <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>. There was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, an householder, who planted a vineyard and made a hedge round about it and dug in it a press and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a strange country.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> another and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Again he sent other servants, more than the former; and they did to them in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And last of all he sent to them his son, saying: They will <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">reverence</a> my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir: come, let us <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">kill</a> him, and we shall have his inheritance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husbandmen?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> They say to him: He will bring those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end and let out his vineyard to other husbandmen that shall render him the fruit in due season.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: Have you never read in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>: The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">head of the corner</a>? By the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> this has been done; and it is wonderful in our eyes.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Therefore I say to you that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> had heard his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he spoke of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And seeking to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</span></p>
