<h1>Matthew Chapter 22</h1>
<div class="h1a">The parable of the marriage feast. Christ orders tribute to be paid to Caesar. He confutes the Sadducees, shows which is the first commandment in the law and puzzles the Pharisees.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, spoke again in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> to them, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is likened to a king who made a marriage for his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he sent his servants to call them that were invited to the marriage: and they would not come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come ye to the marriage.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But they neglected and went their ways, one to his farm and another to his merchandise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the rest laid hands on his servants and, having treated them contumeliously, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But when the king had heard of it, he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">bad</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and the marriage was filled with guests.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who had not on a wedding garment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having on a wedding garment? But he was silent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For many are <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">called</a>, but few are chosen.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they sent to him their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with the Herodians, saying: Master, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou art a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> speaker and teachest the way of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Neither carest thou for any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: for thou dost not regard the person of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Herodians...</strong> That is, some that belonged to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and that joined with him in standing up for the necessity of paying tribute to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>, that is, to the Roman emperor. Some are of opinion that there was a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> called Herodians, from their maintaining that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Tell us therefore what dost thou think? Is it lawful to give tribute to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>, or not?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, said: Why do you tempt me, ye <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Show me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> They say to him: <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a>. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a> the things that are <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a>; and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the things that are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And hearing this, they wondered and, leaving him, went their ways.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> That day there came to him the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who say there is no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>; and asked him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Saying: Master, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> die having no son, his brother shall <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> his wife and raise up issue to his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first having <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> In like manner the second and the third and so on, to the seventh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And last of all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> died also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> At the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> therefore, whose wife of the seven shall she be? For they all had her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: You <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> they shall neither <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> nor be <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a>, but shall be as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels of God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And concerning the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>, have you not read that which was spoken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying to you:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>? He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead but of the living.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And the multitudes hearing it were in admiration at his doctrine.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, hearing that he had silenced the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, came together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And one of them, a doctor of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, asked him, tempting him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Master, which is the great <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandment</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> with thy whole heart and with thy whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and with thy whole <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> This is the greatest and the first <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandment</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And the second is like to this: Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thy neighbour as thyself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> On these two <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a> dependeth the whole <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> being gathered together, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> asked them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Saying: What think you of <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>? Whose son is he? They say to him: <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David's</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> He saith to them: How then doth <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> call him Lord, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> The Lord said to my Lord: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> If <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> then call him Lord, how is he his son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was able to answer him a word: neither durst any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from that day forth ask him any more questions.</span></p>
