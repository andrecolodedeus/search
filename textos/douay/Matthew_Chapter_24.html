<div class="h1a">Christ foretells the destruction of the temple, with the signs that shall come before it and before the last judgment. We must always watch.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being come out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, went away. And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to show him the buildings of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he answering, said to them: Do you see all these things? <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, there shall not be left here a stone upon a stone that shall not be destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when he was sitting on <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount Olivet</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to him privately, saying: Tell us when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the consummation of the world?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to them: Take heed that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seduce you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For many will come in my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> saying, I am <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. And they will seduce many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And you shall hear of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and rumours of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. See that ye be not troubled. For these things must come to pass: but the end is not yet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be pestilences and famines and earthquakes in places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now all these are the beginnings of sorrows.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put you to death</a>: and you shall be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And then shall many be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> and shall betray one another and shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And many false <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> shall rise and shall seduce many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> hath abounded, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of many shall grow cold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But he that shall persevere to the end, he shall be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> shall be preached in the whole world, for a testimony to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>: and then shall the consummation come.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> When therefore you shall see the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, which was spoken of by <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel the prophet</a>, standing in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place: he that readeth let him understand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then they that are in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, let them flee to the mountains:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he that is on the housetop, let him not come down to take any thing out of his house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he that is in the field, let him not go back to take his coat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And woe to them that are with child and that give suck in those days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that your flight be not in the winter or on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For there shall be then great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, neither shall be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And unless those days had been shortened, no flesh should be saved: but for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> those days shall be shortened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Then if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall say to you, Lo here is <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, or there: do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For there shall arise <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">false Christs</a> and false <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and shall show great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a>, insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Behold I have told it to you, beforehand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> If therefore they shall say to you, Behold he is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: go ye not out. Behold he is in the closets: <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For as lightning cometh out of the east and appeareth even into the west: so shall also the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Wheresoever the body shall be, there shall the eagles also be gathered together. <span class="stiki"><strong>Wheresoever, etc...</strong> The coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall be sudden, and manifest to all the world, like lightning: and wheresoever he shall come, thither shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> be gathered to him, as eagles are gathered about a dead body.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the powers of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shall be moved. <span class="stiki"><strong>The stars...</strong> Or flaming meteors resembling stars.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And then shall appear the sign of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. And then shall all tribes of the earth mourn: and they shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> with much power and majesty. <span class="stiki"><strong>The sign, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he shall send his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with a trumpet and a great voice: and they shall gather together his <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> from the four winds, from the farthest parts of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> to the utmost bounds of them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And from the fig tree learn a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>: When the branch thereof is now tender and the leaves come forth, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that summer is nigh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> So you also, when you shall see all these things, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that it is nigh, even at the doors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you that this <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> shall not pass till all these things be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Heaven and earth shall pass: but my words shall not pass. <span class="stiki"><strong>Shall pass...</strong> Because they shall be changed at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a> into a new <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and new earth.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> But of that day and hour no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a>: no, not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> alone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And as in the days of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a>, so shall also the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> For, as in the days before the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">flood</a> they were eating and drinking, <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marrying</a> and giving in <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>, even till that day in which <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe</a> entered into the <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">ark</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not till the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">flood</a> came and took them all away: so also shall the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> Then two shall be in the field. One shall be taken and one shall be left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> shall be grinding at the mill. One shall be taken and one shall be left.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Watch ye therefore, because you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what hour your <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> will come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> But this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye, that, if the goodman of the house <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> at what hour the thief would come, he would certainly watch and would not suffer his house to be broken open.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Wherefore be you also ready, because at what hour you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> will come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to give them meat in season?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is that servant, whom when his lord shall come he shall find so doing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you: he shall place him over all his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> But if that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> servant shall say in his heart: My lord is long a coming:</span>
