<div class="h1a">The parable of the ten virgins and of the talents. The description of the last judgment.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then shall the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> be like to ten <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And five of them were foolish and five wise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh. Go ye forth to meet him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then all those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> arose and trimmed their lamps.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now whilst they went to buy the bridegroom came: and they that were ready went in with him to the <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>. And the door was shut.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But at last came also the other <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But he answering said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, I <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> you not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Watch ye therefore, because you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the day nor the hour.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For even as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> going into a far country called his servants and delivered to them his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he that had received the five talents went his way and traded with the same and gained other five.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And in like manner he that had received the two gained other two.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But he that had received the one, going his way, digged into the earth and hid his lord's money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But after a long time the lord of those servants came and reckoned with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents. Behold I have gained other five over and above.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> His lord said to him: Well done, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things. Enter thou into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of thy lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me. Behold I have gained other two.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> His lord said to him: Well done, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things. Enter thou into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of thy lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that thou art a hard <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; thou reapest where thou hast not sown and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And being <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">afraid</a>, I went and hid thy talent in the earth. Behold here thou hast that which is thine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And his lord answering, said to him: <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">Wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> servant, thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knewest</a> that I reap where I sow not and gather where I have not strewed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers: and at my coming I should have received my own with <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Take ye away therefore the talent from him and give it him that hath ten talents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And the unprofitable servant, cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall come in his majesty, and all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> shall be gathered together before him: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, possess you the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you came to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Then shall the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry and fed thee: thirsty and gave thee drink?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Or when did we see thee a stranger and took thee in? Or naked and covered thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Or when did we see thee sick or in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and came to thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And the king answering shall say to them: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a>, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, which was prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> For I was hungry and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty and you gave me not to drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> I was a stranger and you took me not in: naked and you covered me not: sick and in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and you did not visit me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and did not minister to thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Then he shall answer them, saying: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>: I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And these shall go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting punishment</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">life everlasting</a>.</span></p>
