<div class="h1a">The Jews conspire against Christ. He is anointed by Mary. The treason of Judas. The last supper. The prayer in the garden. The apprehension of our Lord. His treatment in the house of Caiphas.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had ended all these words, he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that after two days shall be the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be delivered up to be crucified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then were gathered together the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ancients of the people, into the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, who was called <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they consulted together that by subtilty they might apprehend <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and put him to death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But they said: Not on the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">festival day</a>, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was in <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethania</a>, in the house of Simon the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> There came to him a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> having an alabaster box of precious <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> and poured it on his head as he was at table.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> seeing it had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For this might have been sold for much and given to the poor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> it, said to them: Why do you trouble this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? For she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always. <span class="stiki"><strong>Me you have not always...</strong> Viz., in a visible manner, as when conversant here on earth; and as we have the poor, whom we may daily assist and relieve.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For she in pouring this <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> on my body hath done it for my burial.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, wheresoever this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then went one of the twelve, who was called <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And on the first day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Azymes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>? <span class="stiki"><strong>Azymes...</strong> <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">Feast of the unleavened bread</a>. <strong>Pasch...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said: Go ye into the city to a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and say to him: The master saith, My time is near at hand. With thee I make the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> with my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> did as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appointed to them: and they prepared the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">pasch</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And whilst they were eating, he said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you that one of you is about to betray me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they being very much troubled began every one to say: Is it I, Lord?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he answering said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> indeed goeth, as it is written of him. But woe to that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> by whom the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had not been born.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> that betrayed him answering, said: Is it I, <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbi</a>? He saith to him: Thou hast said it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And whilst they were at <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">supper</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> took <a href="../cathen/02749a.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> and broke and gave to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and said: Take ye and eat. This is my <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">body</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>This is my body...</strong> He does not say, <em>This is the figure of my body</em>--but <em>This is my body</em>. (2 Council of Nice, Act. 6.) Neither does he say <em>in this</em>, or <em>with this is my body</em>; but absolutely, <em>This is my body</em>: which plainly implies <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And taking the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, he gave thanks and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this. <span class="stiki"><strong>Drink ye all of this...</strong> This was spoken to the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; who were the all then present; and they all drank of it, says <a href="../douay/mar014.htm#verse23">Mark 14:23</a>. But it no ways follows from these words spoken to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are here commanded to <a href="../cathen/15244b.htm">drink of the chalice</a>; any more than that all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are commanded to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, offer and administer this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> upon this same occasion, and at the same time, bid the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> do so; in these words, <a href="../douay/luk022.htm#verse19">Luke 22:19</a>, Do this for a commemoration of me.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For this is my <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">blood of the new testament</a>, which shall be shed for many unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Blood of the new testament...</strong> As the old testament was <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> with the blood of victims, by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in these words: This is the blood of the testament, etc. [<a href="../douay/heb009.htm#verse20">Hebrews 9:20</a>]; so here is the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> and institution of the new testament, in the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, here mystically shed by these words: This is the blood of the new testament, etc.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of my Father</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Fruit of the vine...</strong> These words, by the account of <a href="../douay/luk022.htm#verse18">Luke 22:18</a>, were not spoken of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">sacramental cup</a>, but of the wine that was drunk with the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a>. Though the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">sacramental cup</a> might also be called the fruit of the vine, because it was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> from <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, and retains the likeness, and all the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidents</a> or qualities of <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> being said, they went out unto <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">mount Olivet</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: All you shall be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd: and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed. <span class="stiki"><strong>Scandalized in me, etc...</strong> Forasmuch as my being apprehended shall make you all run away and forsake me.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But after I shall be <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>, I will go before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> answering, said to him: Although all shall be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> in thee, I will never be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to thee that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came with them into a country place which is called <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">Gethsemani</a>. And he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Sit you here, till I go yonder and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And taking with him <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Then he saith to them: My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death. Stay you here and watch with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And going a little further, he fell upon his face, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and saying: My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, if it be possible, let this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And he cometh to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and findeth them asleep. And he saith to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Watch ye: and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that ye enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Again the second time, he went and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying: My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, if this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And leaving them, he went again: and he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the third time, saying the selfsame word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Then he cometh to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and said to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest. Behold the hour is at hand: and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> Rise: let us go. Behold he is at hand that will betray me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> As he yet spoke, behold <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the ancients of the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, that is he. Hold him fast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And forthwith coming to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he said: Hail, <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbi</a>. And he <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up and laid hands on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and held him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And behold one of them that were with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the <a href="../cathen/09566b.htm">servant of the high priest</a>, cut off his ear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> How then shall the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> be fulfilled, that so it must be done?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> In that same hour, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to the multitudes: You are come out, as it were to a robber, with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and you laid not hands on me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Now all this was done that the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> might be fulfilled. Then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, all leaving him, fled.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> But they holding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> led him to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the ancients were assembled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> followed him afar off, even to the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the whole <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">council</a> sought <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witness against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that they might <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put him to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And they found not, whereas many <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witnesses:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And they said: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> said, I am able to destroy the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> and after three days to rebuild it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> held his peace. And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> said to him: I adjure thee by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, that thou tell us if thou be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> sitting on the right hand of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and coming in the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> rent his garments, saying: He hath <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>: what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> Then did they spit in his face and buffeted him. And others struck his face with the palms of their hands,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> Saying: <a href="../cathen/05497a.htm">Prophesy</a> unto us, O <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. Who is he that struck thee?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> But <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> sat without in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>. And there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus the Galilean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse70">70</span> But he denied before them all, saying: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what thou sayest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse71">71</span> And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him; and she saith to them that were there: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> also was with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse72">72</span> And again he denied with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse73">73</span> And after a little while, they came that stood by and said to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>: Surely thou also art one of them. For even thy speech doth discover thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse74">74</span> Then he began to <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> and to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And immediately the cock crew.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse75">75</span> And <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> remembered the word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.</span></p>
