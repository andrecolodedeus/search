<h1>Matthew Chapter 27</h1>
<div class="h1a">The continuation of the history of the passion of Christ. His death and burial.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when morning was come, all the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ancients of the people took counsel against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that they might <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put him to death</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they brought him bound and delivered him to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> the governor.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ancients,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Saying: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? Look thou to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And casting down the pieces of silver in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, he departed and went and <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">hanged himself</a> with an halter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">lawful</a> to put them into the <em>corbona</em>, because it is the price of blood. <span class="stiki"><strong>Corbona...</strong> A place in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> where the people put in their gifts or <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For this cause that field was called <a href="../cathen/07103b.htm"><em>Haceldama</em></a>, that is, <em>the field of blood</em>, even to this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they gave them unto the potter's field, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appointed to me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: Thou sayest it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when he was accused by the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ancients, he answered nothing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he answered him to never a word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he had then a notorious prisoner that was called Barabbas.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> They therefore being gathered together, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: Whom will you that I release to you: Barabbas, or <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that is called <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that for envy they had delivered him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for I have suffered many things this day in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> because of him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and ancients persuaded the people that they should ask Barabbas and make <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said: Barabbas.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saith to them: What shall I do then with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that is called <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>? They say all: Let him be crucified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The governor said to them: Why, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, taking water <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washed his hands</a> before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Look you to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and upon our children.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Then he released to them Barabbas: and having scourged <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, delivered him unto them to be crucified.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Then the soldiers of the governor, taking <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> into the <a href="../cathen/12404a.htm">hall</a>, gathered together unto him the whole band.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And platting a <a href="../cathen/04540b.htm">crown of thorns</a>, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bowing the knee</a> before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And spitting upon him, they took the reed and struck his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him and put on him his own garments and led him away to crucify him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And going out, they found a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of Cyrene, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Simon: him they forced to take up his <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they came to the place that is called <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Golgotha</a>, which is the place of <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Calvary</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And they gave him <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, <a href="../cathen/06375b.htm">casting lots</a>; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they <a href="../cathen/06375b.htm">cast lots</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And they sat and watched him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And they put over his head his <a href="../cathen/14745b.htm">cause</a> written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand and one on the left.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And they that passed by <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> him, wagging their heads,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self. If thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, come down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> In like manner also the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and ancients, mocking said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> He saved others: himself he cannot save. If he be the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, let him now come down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>: and we will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> He trusted in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: let him now deliver him if he will have him. For he said: I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And the selfsame thing the thieves also that were crucified with him reproached him with.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> Now from the <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sixth hour</a>, there was darkness over the whole earth, until the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And about the <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">ninth hour</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cried with a loud voice, saying: <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Eli</a>, <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Eli</a>, lamma sabacthani? That is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">My God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">My God</a>, why hast thou forsaken me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And some that stood there and heard said: This <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> calleth <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And the others said: Let be. Let us see whether <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> will come to deliver him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">ghost</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And behold the veil of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was rent in two from the top even to the bottom: and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that had slept <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">arose</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And coming out of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> after his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, came into the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a> and appeared to many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> and they that were with him watching <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, having seen the earthquake and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And there were there many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> afar off, who had followed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, ministering unto him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Among whom was <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And when it was evening, there came a certain <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of Arimathea, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph</a>, who also himself was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> He went to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and asked the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> commanded that the body should be delivered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> And <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph</a> taking the body wrapped it up in a <a href="../cathen/13762a.htm">clean linen cloth</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And laid it in his own new <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">monument</a>, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">monument</a> and went his way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And there was there <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> and the other Mary, sitting over against the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And the next day, which followed the <a href="../cathen/11476a.htm">day of preparation</a>, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> came together to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, <span class="stiki"><strong>The day of preparation...</strong> The eve of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; so called, because on that day they prepared all things necessary; not being allowed so much as to dress their meat on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rise again</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> Command therefore the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a> to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> come and steal him away and say to the people: He is <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen from the dead</a>. And the last <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> shall be worse than the first.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saith to them: You have a guard. Go, guard it as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And they departing, made the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a> sure, sealing the stone and setting guards.</span></p>
