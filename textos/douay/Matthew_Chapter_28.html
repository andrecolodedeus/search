<div class="h1a">The resurrection of Christ. His commission to his disciples.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And in the end of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> and the other Mary, to see the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And behold there was a great earthquake. For an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and coming rolled back the stone and sat upon it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And his countenance was as lightning and his raiment as snow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror and became as dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answering, said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: Fear not you: for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you seek <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who was crucified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He is not here. For he is <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen</a>, as he said. Come, and see the place where the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> was laid.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And going quickly, tell ye his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that he is <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen</a>. And behold he will go before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. There you shall see him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they went out quickly from the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a> with fear and great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, running to tell his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And behold, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> met them, saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. There they shall see me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who when they were departed, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> all things that had been done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel, gave a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">great sum of money</a> to the soldiers,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Saying: Say you, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came by night and stole him away when we were asleep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And if the governor shall hear of this, we will persuade him and secure you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So they taking the <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">money</a>, did as they were taught: and this word was spread abroad among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> even unto this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the eleven <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> went into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, unto the mountain where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had appointed them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And seeing him they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>: but some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> coming, spoke to them, saying: All power is given to me in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and in earth. <span class="stiki"><strong>All power, etc...</strong> See here the warrant and commission of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their successors, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's church</a>. He received from his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> all power in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and in earth: and in virtue of this power, he sends them (even as his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> sent him, <a href="../douay/joh020.htm#verse21">John 20:21</a>) to teach and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, not one, but all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>; and instruct them in all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>: and that he may assist them effectually in the execution of this commission, he <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a> to be with them, not for three or four hundred years only, but all days, even to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">consummation of the world</a>. How then could the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ever go astray; having always with her <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, as is here <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself, who is the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life. <a href="../douay/joh014.htm">John 14</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Going therefore, teach ye all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>: <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And behold I am with you all days, even to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">consummation of the world</a>.</span></p>
