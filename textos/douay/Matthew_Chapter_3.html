<div class="h1a">The preaching of John: Christ is baptized.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And in those days cometh <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> preaching in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And saying: Do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand. <span class="stiki"><strong>Do penance...</strong> <em>Paenitentiam agite</em>. Which word, according to the use of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">holy fathers</a>, does not only signify <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a> and amendment of life, but also punishing past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and such like <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">penitential</a> exercises.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For this is he that was spoken of by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a>, saying: A voice of one crying in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, Prepare ye the way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, make straight his paths.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the same <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> had his garment of <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">camel's hair</a>, and a leathern girdle about his loins: and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then went out to him <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and all the country about <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him in the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And seeing many of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> coming to his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he said to them: Ye brood of vipers, who hath showed you to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come? <span class="stiki"><strong>Pharisees and Sadducees...</strong> These were two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: of which the former were for the most part notorious <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a>; the latter, a kind of <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">freethinkers</a> in matters of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And think not to say within yourselves, We have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> for our father. For I tell you that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able of these stones to raise up children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in water unto <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then cometh <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, unto <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> stayed him, saying: I ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by thee, and comest thou to me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfil all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Then he suffered him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> were opened to him: and he saw the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> descending as a <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a>, and coming upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And behold a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> saying: This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased.</span></p>
