<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when he had <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">tempter</a> coming said to him: If thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Who answered and said: It is written, Not in bread alone doth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> live, but in every <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word</a> that proceedeth from the mouth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> took him up into the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>, and set him upon the pinnacle of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And said to him: If thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, cast thyself down, for it is written: That he hath given his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge over thee, and in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: It is written again: Thou shalt not tempt the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Again the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> took him up into a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of them, <span class="stiki"><strong>Showed him, etc...</strong> That is, pointed out to him where each kingdom lay; and set forth in words what was most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and admirable in each of them. Or also set before his eyes, as it were in a large map, a lively representation of all those kingdoms.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And said to him: All these will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: Begone, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: for it is written: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shalt thou <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>, and him only shalt thou serve.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> left him; and behold <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came and ministered to him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had heard that <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> was delivered up, he retired into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And leaving the city <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, he came and dwelt in <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a> on the sea coast, in the borders of <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthalim</a>;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> That it might be fulfilled which was said by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah the prophet</a>:</span></p>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> From that time <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> began to preach, and to say: Do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> walking by the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">sea of Galilee</a>, saw two brethren, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon who is called Peter</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers).</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he saith to them: Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they immediately leaving their nets, followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James the son of Zebedee</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, mending their nets: and he called them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they forthwith left their nets and <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went about all <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, teaching in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>: and healing all manner of sickness and every infirmity, among the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And his fame went throughout all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and they presented to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and such as were <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">lunatics</a>, and those that had the palsy, and he cured them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And much people followed him from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/04664b.htm">Decapolis</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and from beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span></p>
