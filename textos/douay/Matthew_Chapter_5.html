<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He therefore that shall break one of these least <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments</a>, and shall so teach <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall be called the least in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Be at agreement with thy adversary betimes, whilst thou art in the way with him: lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</span>
