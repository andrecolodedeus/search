<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Judge not, that you may not be judged.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Thou <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrite</a>, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Or what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If you then being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> gifts to your children: how much more will your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to them that ask him?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> All things therefore whatsoever you would that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should do to you, do you also to them. For this is the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Beware of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> By their fruits you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. Do <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Even so every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree bringeth forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruit, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tree bringeth forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit, neither can an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tree bring forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Every tree that bringeth not forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Wherefore by their fruits you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>: but he that doth the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, and done many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And then will I profess unto them, I never <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> you: depart from me, you that work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that built his house upon a rock,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And every one that heareth these my words and doth them not, shall be like a foolish <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that built his house upon the sand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And it came to pass when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>.</span></p>
