<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when he was come down from the <a href="../cathen/02369a.htm">mountain</a>, great multitudes followed him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And behold a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> came and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> stretching forth his hand, touched him, saying: I will, be thou made clean. And forthwith his <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> was <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">cleansed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: See thou tell no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but go, show thyself to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and offer the gift which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when he had entered into <a href="../cathen/03309a.htm">Capharnaum</a>, there came to him a <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>, beseeching him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, and is grievously tormented.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: I will come and heal him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>, making answer, said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For I also am a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">authority</a>, having under me soldiers; and I say to this, <em>Go</em>, and he goeth, and to another <em>Come</em>, and he cometh, and to my servant, <em>Do this</em>, and he doeth it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> hearing this, marvelled; and said to them that followed him. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But the children of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a> shall be cast out into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">exterior darkness</a>: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a>: Go, and as thou hast <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so be it done to thee. And the servant was healed at the same hour.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was come into <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> house, he saw his wife's mother lying, and sick of a fever;</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose and ministered to them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when evening was come, they brought to him many that were <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> with <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>: and he <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirits</a> with his word: and all that were sick he healed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">prophet Isaias</a>, saying: <em>He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases</em>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> seeing great multitudes about him, gave orders to pass over the water.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And a certain <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a> came and said to him: Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou shalt go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests; but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> hath not where to lay his head.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And another of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> said to him: Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to him: Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when he entered into the boat, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> followed him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And behold a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves, but he was asleep.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they came to him, and awaked him, saying: Lord, save us, we perish.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them: Why are you fearful, O ye of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Then rising up, he commanded the winds, and the sea, and there came a great calm.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> wondered, saying: What manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is this, for the winds and the sea <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when he was come on the other side of the water, into the country of the <a href="../cathen/06469a.htm">Gerasens</a>, there met him two that were <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> with <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, coming out of the sepulchres, exceeding fierce, so that none could pass by that way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And behold they cried out, saying: What have we to do with thee, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And there was, not far from them, a herd of many swine feeding.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> besought him, saying: If thou <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast us out</a> hence, send us into the herd of swine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And he said to them: Go. But they going out went into the swine, and behold the whole herd ran <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> down a steep place into the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">sea</a>: and they perished in the waters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they that kept them fled: and coming into the city, told every thing, and concerning them that had been <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And behold the whole city went out to meet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart from their coast.</span></p>
