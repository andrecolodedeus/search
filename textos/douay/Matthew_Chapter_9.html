<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And entering into a boat, he passed over the water and came into his own city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a bed. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, seeing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, said to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sick of the palsy: Be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> heart, son, thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And behold some of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> said within themselves: He <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemeth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your hearts?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Whether is easier, to say, Thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven thee: or to say, Arise, and walk?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> hath power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, (then said he to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sick of the palsy), <em>Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he arose, and went into his house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the multitude seeing it, feared, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that gave such power to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> passed on from thence, he saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> sitting in the custom house, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">Matthew</a>; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he arose up and followed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners came, and sat down with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> seeing it, said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Why doth your master eat with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have <a href="../cathen/10198d.htm">mercy</a> and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. For I am not come to call the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, but sinners.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then came to him the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a>, saying: Why do we and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> often, but thy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> do not <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to them: Can the children of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Can the children of the bridegroom...</strong> This, by a Hebraism, signifies the friends or companions of the bridegroom.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth unto an old garment. For it taketh away the fulness thereof from the garment, and there is made a greater rent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Neither do they put new wine into old bottles. Otherwise the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish. But new wine they put into new bottles: and both are preserved.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> As he was speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler came up, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him, saying: Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">lay thy hand</a> upon her, and she shall live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> rising up followed him, with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And behold a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the <a href="../cathen/06307b.htm">hem</a> of his garment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For she said within herself: If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> turning and seeing her, said: Be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> heart, daughter, thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> hath made thee whole. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made whole from that hour.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was come into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making a rout,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He said: Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand. And the maid arose.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> passed from thence, there followed him two blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, O <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when he was come to the house, the blind <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> came to him. And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saith to them, Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that I can do this unto you? They say to him, Yea, Lord.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, be it done unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And their eyes were opened, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> strictly charged them, saying, See that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But they going out, spread his fame abroad in all that country.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And when they were gone out, behold they brought him a dumb <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And after the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out</a>, the dumb <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> spoke, and the multitudes wondered, saying, Never was the like seen in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> said, By the <a href="../cathen/09410a.htm">prince of devils</a> he casteth out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went about all the cities and towns, teaching in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>, and healing every disease, and every infirmity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And seeing the multitudes, he had compassion on them: because they were distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Then he saith to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> ye therefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord of the harvest</a>, that he send forth labourers into his harvest.</span></p>
