<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Woe to you that devise that which is unprofitable, and work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your beds: in the morning light they execute it, because their hand is against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they have <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> fields, and taken them by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and houses they have forcibly taken away: and oppressed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and his house, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and his inheritance.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Therefore thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Behold I devise an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>: from which you shall not withdraw your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for this is a very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> time.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> In that day a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> shall be taken up upon you, and a song shall be sung with melody by them that say: We are laid waste and spoiled: the portion of my people is changed: how shall he depart from me, whereas he is returning that will divide our land? <span class="stiki"><strong>How shall he depart, etc...</strong> How do you pretend to say that the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> is departing; when indeed he is coming to divide our lands amongst his subjects?</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord of a lot in the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thou shalt have none, etc...</strong> Thou shalt have no longer any lot or inheritance in the land of the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Speak ye not, saying: It shall not drop upon these, confusion shall not take them. <span class="stiki"><strong>It shall not drop, etc...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> shall not come upon these. Such were the sentiments of the people that were unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the threats of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Jacob</a> saith: Is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> straitened or are these his thoughts? Are not my words <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him that walketh uprightly?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy: you have taken away the cloak off from the coat: and them that passed harmless you have turned to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>You have taken away, etc...</strong> You have even stripped people of their necessary garments: and have treated such as were innocently passing on the way, as if they were at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with you.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> You have cast out the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of my people from their houses, in which they took delight: you have taken my praise forever from their children. <span class="stiki"><strong>You have cast out, etc...</strong> either by depriving them of their houses: or, by your crimes, given occasion to their being carried away captives, and their children, by that means, never learning to praise the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you. For that <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a> of the land, it shall be corrupted with a grievous corruption.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> I were not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that hath the spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie: I will let drop to thee of wine, and of drunkenness: and it shall be this people upon whom it shall drop. <span class="stiki"><strong>Would God, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> could have wished, out of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to his people, that he might be deceived in denouncing to them these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that were to fall upon them: but by conforming himself to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he declares to them, that he is sent to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>, literally to let drop upon them, the wine of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> indignation, with which they should be made drunk; that is, stupefied and cast down.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>: I will bring together the remnant of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of the multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For he shall go up that shall open the way before them: they shall divide and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> at the head of them.</span></blockquote>
