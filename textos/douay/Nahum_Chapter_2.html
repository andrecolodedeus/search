<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> He is come up that shall destroy before thy face, that shall keep the siege: watch the way, fortify thy loins, strengthen thy power exceedingly.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath rendered the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: because the spoilers have laid them waste, and have marred their vine branches. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hath rendered the pride of Jacob, etc...</strong> He hath punished <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a> for his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; and therefore Ninive must not expect to escape. Or else, rendering the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a> means rewarding, that is, punishing Ninive for the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> they exercised against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The shield of his mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is like fire, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the army are clad in scarlet, the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his preparation, and the drivers are stupefied. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of his mighty men, etc...</strong> He speaks of the Chaldeans and <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> sent to destroy Ninive. -- Ibid. <strong>Stupefied...</strong> consopiti. That is, they drive on furiously like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> intoxicated with wine.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> They are in confusion in the ways, the chariots jostle one against another in the streets: their looks are like torches, like lightning running to and fro.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He will muster up his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">valiant</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they shall stumble in their march: they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof: and a covering shall be prepared. <span class="stiki"><strong>Stumble in their march...</strong> By running hastily on.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> is thrown down to the ground.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the soldier is led away captive: and her bondwomen were led away mourning as doves, murmuring in their hearts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And as for Ninive, her waters are like a great <a href="../cathen/12235a.htm">pool</a>: but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> flee away. They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that will return back.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the gold: for there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth, and the knees fail, and all the loins lose their strength: and the faces of them all are as the blackness of a kettle.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, to which the lion went, to enter in thither, the young lion, and there was none to make them afraid?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his lionesses: and he filled his holes with prey, and his den with rapine.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Behold I come against thee, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, and I will burn thy chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey out of the land, and the voice of thy messengers shall be heard no more.</span></blockquote>
