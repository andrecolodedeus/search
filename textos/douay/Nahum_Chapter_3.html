<div class="h1a">The miserable destruction of Niniveh.</div>

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Woe to thee, O city of blood, all full of lies and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: rapine shall not depart from thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the neighing horse; and of the running chariot, and of the horsemen coming up,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And of the shining sword, and of the glittering spear, and of a multitude slain, and of a grievous destruction: and there is no end of carcasses, and they shall fall down on their dead bodies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that was beautiful and agreeable, and that made use of witchcraft, that sold nations through her fornications, and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> through her witchcrafts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Behold I come against thee, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: and I will discover thy shame to thy face, and will show thy nakedness to the nations, and thy shame to kingdoms.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I will cast abominations upon thee, and will disgrace thee, and will make an example of thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And it shall come to pass that every one that shall see thee, shall flee from thee, and shall say: Ninive is laid waste: who shall bemoan thee? whence shall I seek a comforter for thee?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Art thou better than the populous Alexandria, that dwelleth among the rivers? waters are round about it: the sea is its riches: the waters are its walls. <span class="stiki"><strong>Populous Alexandria...</strong> No-Ammon. A populous city of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> destroyed by the Chaldeans, and afterwards rebuilt by <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Alexander<!--</a>-->, and called <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. Others suppose No-Ammon to be the same as <a href="../cathen/14562c.htm">Diospolis</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were the strength thereof, and there is no end: Africa and the Libyans were thy helpers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Yet she also was removed and carried into captivity: her young children were dashed in pieces at the top of every street, and they cast lots upon her nobles, and all her great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were bound in fetters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Therefore thou also shalt be made drunk, and shalt be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>: and thou shalt seek help from thy enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with their green figs: if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the eater.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Behold thy people in the midst of thee are <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open to thy enemies, the fire shall devour thy bars.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Draw thee water for the siege, build up thy bulwarks: go into the clay, and tread, work it and make brick.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> There shall the fire devour thee: thou shalt perish by the sword, it shall devour thee like the bruchus: assemble together like the bruchus, make thyself many like the locust.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thou hast multiplied thy merchandises above the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: the bruchus hath spread himself and flown away.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Thy guards are like the locusts: and thy little ones like the locusts of locusts which swarm on the hedges in the day of cold: the sun arose, and they flew away, and their place was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> where they were. <span class="stiki"><strong>Locusts of locusts...</strong> The young locusts.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Thy shepherds have slumbered, O king of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, thy princes shall be <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->buried<!--</a>-->: thy people are hid in the mountains, and there is none to gather them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Thy destruction is not hidden, thy wound is grievous: all that have heard the fame of thee, have clapped their hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> passed continually?</span></blockquote>
