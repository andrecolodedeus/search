<h1>Nehemiah Chapter 13</h1>
<div class="h1a">Divers abuses are reformed.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And on that day they read in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of Moses</a> in the hearing of the people: and therein was found written, that the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> should not come in to the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Because they met not the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> with bread and water: and they hired against them <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, to <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> them, and our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> turned the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> into <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated every stranger from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And over this thing was Eliasib the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who was set over the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of our God</a>, and was near akin to Tobias. <span class="stiki"><strong>Over this thing, etc...</strong> Or, he was faulty in this thing, or in this kind.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he made him a great storeroom, where before him they laid up gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and of the singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and of the porters, and the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But in all this time I was not in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, because in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">king of Babylon</a>, I went to the king, and after certain days I asked the king:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and I understood the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And it seemed to me exceeding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I commanded and they cleansed again the vessels of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and the frankincense.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I perceived that the portions of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> had not been given them: and that the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and the singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they that ministered were fled away every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his own country:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said: Why have we forsaken the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>? And I gathered them together, and I made them to stand in their places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And all <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> brought the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of the corn, and the wine, and the oil into the storehouses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And we set over the storehouses Selemias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Sadoc the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> Phadaia, and next to them Hanan the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were approved as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a>, and to them were committed the portions of their brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Remember me, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for this thing, and wipe not out my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> In those days I saw in <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> some treading the presses on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>. And I charged them that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares: and they sold them on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">children of Juda</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And I rebuked the chief <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">men of Juda</a>, and said to them: What is this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing that you are doing, profaning the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Did not our fathers do these things, and our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> brought all this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by violating the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And it came to pass, that when the gates of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were at rest on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I commanded that they should not open them till after the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares, stayed without <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, once or twice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on you. And from that time they came no more on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> I spoke also to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>: for this also remember me, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> In those days also I saw <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> wives, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammon</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And their children spoke half in the speech of <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, and could not speak the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Jews' language</a>, but they spoke according to the language of this and that people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And I chid them, and laid my <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> upon them. And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Did not <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in this kind of thing: and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made him king over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and yet <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of other countries brought even him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to transgress against our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a> strange <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>:</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, was son in law to Sanaballat the Horonite, and I drove him from me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Remember them, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that defile the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the law of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in his ministry:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And for the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> of wood at times appointed, and for the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a>: remember me, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
