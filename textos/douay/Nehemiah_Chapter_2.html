<h1>Nehemiah Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Nehemiah with commission from King Artaxerxes comes to Jerusalem: and exhorts the Jews to rebuild the walls.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king: that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king: and I was as one languishing away before his face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized with an exceeding great fear:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then the king said to me: For what dost thou make request? And I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I said to the king: If it seem <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him: For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I said to the king: If it seem <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the king, let him give me <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they convey me over, till I come into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, to give me timber that I may cover the gates of the tower of the house, and the walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter into. And the king gave me according to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> hand of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I came to the governors of the country beyond the river, and gave them the king's <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a>. And the king had sent with me <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captains</a> of soldiers, and horsemen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonite</a>, heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was come, who sought the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I came to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and was there three days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I arose in the night, I and some few <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with me, and I told not any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had put in my heart to do in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and before the dragon fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> which was broken down, and the gates thereof which were consumed with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall, and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and returned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are, because <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and let us be no longer a reproach.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And I showed them how the hand of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with me, and the king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said: Let us rise up, and build. And their hands were strengthened in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonite</a>, and Gossem the Arabian heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are you going to rebel against the king?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I answered them, and said to them: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you have no part, nor <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor remembrance in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span></p>
