<h1>Nehemiah Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">The building is carried on notwithstanding the opposition of their enemies.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: and being moved exceedingly he scoffed at the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And said before his brethren, and the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>: What are the silly <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> doing? Will the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> let them alone? will they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and make an end in a day? are they able to raise stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are burnt?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Tobias also the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonite</a> who was by him said: Let them build: if a fox go up, he will leap over their stone wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Hear thou our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for we are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>: turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> in a land of captivity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Cover not their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, and let not their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be blotted out from before thy face, because they have mocked thy builders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So we built the wall, and joined it all together unto the half thereof: and the heart of the people was excited to work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the Arabians, and the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotians</a> heard that the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were made up, and the breaches began to be closed, that they were exceedingly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and to fight against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and to prepare ambushes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and set watchmen upon the wall day and night against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> said: The strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed, and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to build the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And our enemies said: Let them not know, nor understand, till we come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it came to pass, that when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that dwelt by them came and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence they came to us,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I set the people in the place behind the wall round about in order, with their swords, and spears, and bows.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I looked and rose up: and I said to the chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: be not afraid of them. Remember the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your houses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the thing had been told us, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> defeated their counsel. And we returned all of us to the walls, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of their young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight, with spears, and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the rulers were behind them in all the house of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens, and that laded: with one of his hands he did the work, and with the other he held a sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his reins. And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I said to the nobles, and to the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: The work is great and wide, and we are separated on the wall one far from another:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, run all thither unto us: our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will fight for us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And let us do the work: and let one half of us hold our spears from the rising of the morning, till the stars appear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> At that time also I said to the people: Let every one with his servant stay in the midst of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and let us take our turns in the night, and by day, to work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen that followed me, did not put off our clothes: only every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> stripped himself when he was to be washed.</span></p>
