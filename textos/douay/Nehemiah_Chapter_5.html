<h1>Nehemiah Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">Nehemiah blames the rich, for their oppressing the poor. His exhortation, and bounty to his countrymen.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives against their brethren the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And there were some that said: Our sons and our daughters are very many: let us take up corn for the price of them, and let us eat and live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And there were some that said: Let us mortgage our lands, and our vineyards, and our houses, and let us take corn because of the famine.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And others said: Let us borrow money for the king's tribute, and let us give up our fields and vineyards:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren: and our children as their children. Behold we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters, and some of our daughters are bondwomen already, neither have we wherewith to <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> them, and our fields and our vineyards other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> possess.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I was exceedingly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> when I heard their cry according to these words.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And my heart thought with myself: and I rebuked the nobles and magistrates, and said to them: Do you every one exact <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> of your brethren? And I gathered together a great assembly against them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I said to them: We, as you know, have <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a> according to our ability our brethren the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that were sold to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and will you then sell your brethren, for us to <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> them? And they held their peace, and found not what to answer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I said to them: The thing you do is not <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: why walk you not in the fear of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> our enemies?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Both I and my brethren, and my servants, have lent money and corn to many: let us all agree not to call for it again; let us forgive the debt that is owing to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their vineyards, and their oliveyards, and their houses: and the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which you were wont to exact of them, give it rather for them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they said: We will restore, and we will require nothing of them: and we will do as thou sayest. And I called the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and took an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of them, to do according to what I had said.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Moreover I shook my lap, and said: So may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shake every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that shall not accomplish this word, out of his house, and out of his labours, thus may he be shaken out, and become empty. And all the multitude said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And they praised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the people did according to what was said.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And from the day, in which the king commanded me to be governor in the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my brethren did not eat the yearly allowance that was due to the governors.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the former governors that had been before me, were chargeable to the people, and took of them in bread, and wine, and in money every day forty sicles: and their officers also oppressed the people. But I did not so for the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Moreover I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no land, and all my servants were gathered together to the work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also and the magistrates to the number of one hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, were at my table, besides them that came to us from among the nations that were round about us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And there was prepared for me day be day one ox, and six choice rams, besides fowls, and once in ten days I gave store of divers wines, and many other things: yet I did not require my yearly allowance as governor: for the people were very much impoverished.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Remember me, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> according to all that I have done for this people.</span></p>
