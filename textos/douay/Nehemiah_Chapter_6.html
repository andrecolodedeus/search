<h1>Nehemiah Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">The enemies seek to terrify Nehemiah. He proceeds and finishes the wall.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Sanaballat and Gossem sent to me, saying: Come, and let us make a league together in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a>, in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I answered them after the same manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letter</a> in his hand written in this manner:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> It is reported amongst the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and Gossem hath said it, that thou and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them: for which end</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Thou hast also set up <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, to preach of thee at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying: There is a king in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. The king will hear of these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I sent to them, saying: There is no such thing done as thou sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For all these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off. Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more:</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia, the son of Metabeel privately. And he said: Let us consult together in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and let us shut the doors of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I said: Should such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as I flee? and who is there that being as I am, would go into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, to save his life? I will not go in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I understood that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had not sent him, but that he had spoken to me as if he had been <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesying</a>, and Tobias, and Sanaballat had hired him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do this thing, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and they might have some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to upbraid me withal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Remember me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to their works of this kind: and Noadias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that would have put me in fear.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Moreover in those days many <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> were sent by the principal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to Tobias, and from Tobias there came <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For there were many in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they praised him also before me, and they related my words to him: And Tobias sent <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">letters</a> to put me in fear.</span></p>
