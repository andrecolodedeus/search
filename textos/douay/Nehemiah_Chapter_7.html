<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now after the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and numbered the porters and singing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I commanded Hanani my brother, and Hananias ruler of the house of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, (for he seemed as a sincere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and one that feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above the rest),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I said to them: Let not the gates of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> be opened till the sun be hot. And while they were yet standing by the gates were shut, and barred: and I set watchmen of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, every one by their courses, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> over against his house.</span>
