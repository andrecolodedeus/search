<div class="h1a">Esdras reads the law before the people. Nehemiah comforts them. They celebrate the feast of tabernacles.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the seventh month came: and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> were in their cities. And all the people were gathered together as one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to the street which is before the water gate, and they spoke to <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, to bring the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of the law of Moses</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Then <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> brought the law before the multitude of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and all those that could understand, in the first day of the seventh month.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he read it plainly in the street that was before the water gate, from the morning until midday, before the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and all those that could understand: and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a> stood upon a step of wood, which he had made to speak upon, and there stood by him <a href="../cathen/10046b.htm">Mathathias</a>, and Semeia, and Ania, and Uria, and Helcia, and Maasia, on his right hand: and on the left, Phadaia, Misael, and Melchia, and Hasum, and Hasbadana, Zacharia and Mosollam.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> opened the book before all the people: for he was above all the people: and when he had opened it, all the people stood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and all the people answered, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>: lifting up their hands: and they bowed down, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with their faces to the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now Josue, and Bani, and Serebia, Jamin, Accub, Sephtai, Odia, Maasia, Celtia, Azarias, Jozabed, Hanan, Phalaia, the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, made silence among the people to hear the law: and the people stood in their place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they read in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of the law of God</a> distinctly and plainly to be understood: and they understood when it was read.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Nehemias (he is Athersatha) and <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> who interpreted to all the people, said: This is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>: do not mourn, nor weep: for all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said to them: Go, eat fat meats, and drink sweet wine, and send portions to them that have not prepared for themselves: because it is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and be not sad: for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is our strength.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> stilled all the people, saying: Hold your peace, for the day is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and be not sorrowful.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So all the people went to eat and drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth: because they understood the words that he had taught them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And on the second day the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of all the people, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> were gathered together to <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribe</a>, that he should interpret to them the words of the law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they found written in the law, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> should dwell in tabernacles, on the feast, in the seventh month:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And that they should proclaim and publish the word in all their cities, and in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying: Go forth to the mount, and fetch branches of olive, and branches of beautiful wood, branches of myrtle, and branches of palm, and branches of thick trees, to make tabernacles, as it is written.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the people went forth, and brought. And they made themselves tabernacles every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> on the top of his house, and in their <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">courts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And all the assembly of them that were returned from the captivity, made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles: for since the days of <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a> the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> had not done so, until that day: and there was exceeding great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he read in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">book of the law of God</a> day by day, from the first day till the last, and they kept the solemnity seven days, and in the eighth day a solemn assembly according to the manner.</span></p>
