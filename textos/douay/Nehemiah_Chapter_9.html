<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And in the four and twentieth day of the month the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> came together with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and with <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>, and earth upon them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the seed of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> separated themselves from every stranger: and they stood, and confessed their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> of their fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they rose up to stand: and they read in the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">book of the law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, four times in the day, and four times they confessed, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And there stood up upon the step of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, Josue, and Bani, and Cedmihel, Sabania, Bonni, Sarebias, Bani, and Chanani: and they cried with a loud voice to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> Josue and Cedmihel, Bonni, Hasebnia, Serebia, Oduia, Sebnia, and Phathahia, said: Arise, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a> from eternity to eternity: and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> be the high <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with all <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> and praise.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thou thyself, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> alone, thou hast made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and all the host thereof: the earth and all things that are in it: the seas and all that are therein: and thou givest life to all these things, and the host of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoreth</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Thou O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, art he who chosest <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a>, and broughtest him forth out of the fire of the Chaldeans, and gavest him the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The fire of the Chaldeans...</strong> The city of Ur in Chaldea, the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of which signifies fire. Or out of the fire of the tribulations and temptations, to which he was there exposed. The ancient <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbins</a> understood this literally, affirming that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abram</a> was cast into the fire by the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, and brought out by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> without any hurt.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And thou didst find his heart <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> before thee: and thou madest a covenant with him, to give him the land of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, and of the Pherezite, and of the Jebusite, and of the Gergezite, to give it to his seed: and thou hast fulfilled thy words, because thou art <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and thou didst hear their cry by the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And thou showedst <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a> upon <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, and upon all his servants, and upon the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a> against them: and thou madest thyself a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, as it is at this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land: but their persecutors thou threwest into the depth, as a stone into mighty waters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And in a <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of a cloud</a> thou wast their leader by day, and in a <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of fire</a> by night, that they might see the way by which they went.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Thou camest down also to <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount Sinai</a>, and didst speak with them from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and thou gavest them right judgments, and the law of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> precepts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Thou madest known to them thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, and didst prescribe to them commandments, and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, and the law by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> thy servant.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And thou gavest them bread from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock in their thirst, and thou saidst to them that they should go in, and possess the land, upon which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But they and our fathers dealt <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a>, and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they would not hear, and they remembered not thy wonders which thou hadst done for them. And they hardened their necks, and gave the head to return to their bondage, as it were by contention. But thou, a forgiving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, gracious, and merciful, longsuffering, and full of compassion, didst not forsake them. <span class="stiki"><strong>And gave the head...</strong> That is, they set their head, or were bent to return to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Yea when they had made also to themselves a <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">molten calf</a>, and had said: This is thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that brought thee out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and had committed great blasphemies:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Yet thou, in thy many mercies, didst not leave them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of the cloud</a> departed not from them by day to lead them in the way, and the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of fire</a> by night to show them the way by which they should go.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And thou gavest them thy <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">good Spirit</a> to teach them, and thy <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and thou gavest them water for their thirst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Forty years didst thou feed them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and nothing was wanting to them: their garments did not grow old, and their feet were not worn.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And thou gavest them kingdoms, and nations, and didst divide lots for them: and they possessed the land of Sehon, and the land of the king of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and the land of Og king of Basan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and broughtest them to the land concerning which thou hadst said to their fathers, that they should go in and possess it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the children came and possessed the land, and thou didst <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> before them the inhabitants of the land, the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as it pleased them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they took strong cities and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods: <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">cisterns</a> made by others, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: and they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and abounded with delight in thy great goodness.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But they provoked thee to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and departed from thee, and threw thy law behind their backs: and they killed thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who admonished them earnestly to return to thee: and they were guilty of great blasphemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and they afflicted them. And in the time of their tribulation they cried to thee, and thou heardest from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies thou gavest them saviours, to save them from the hands of their enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But after they had rest, they returned to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in thy sight: and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, and they had dominion over them. Then they returned, and cried to thee: and thou heardest from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and deliveredst them many times in thy mercies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And thou didst admonish them to return to thy law. But they dealt <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a>, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against thy judgments, which if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> do, he shall live in them: and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And thou didst forbear with them for many years, and didst testify against them by thy spirit by the hand of thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and they heard not, and thou didst deliver them into the hand of the people of the lands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Yet in thy very many mercies thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them: because thou art a merciful and gracious <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Now therefore our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, great, strong, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the labour which hath come upon us, upon our kings, and our princes, and our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and our fathers, and all the people from the days of the king of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assur</a>, until this day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And thou art <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> in all things that have come upon us: because thou hast done <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but we have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> Our kings, our princes, our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and our fathers have not kept thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy testimonies which thou hast testified among them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return from their most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> devices.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen: and the land, which thou gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things thereof, and we ourselves are servants in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou hast set over us for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And because of all this we ourselves make a covenant, and write it, and our princes, our <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sign it.</span></p>
