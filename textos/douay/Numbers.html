<h1>Numbers</h1>

<p>This fourth <!--<a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">-->Book of Moses<!--</a>--> is called <em>Numbers</em>, because it begins with the <a href="../cathen/03533a.htm">numbering</a> of the people. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>, from its first words, call it <em>Vaiedabber</em>. It contains the transactions of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> from the second month of the second year after their going out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, until the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year; that is, a history almost of thirty-nine years. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">PENTATEUCH</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/num001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> The children of Israel are numbered: the Levites are designed to serve the tabernacle.
<br><a href="../douay/num002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> The order of the tribes in their camp.
<br><a href="../douay/num003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> The Levites are numbered and their offices distinguished. They are taken in the place of the firstborn of the children of Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/num004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> The age and time of the Levites' service: their offices and burdens.
<br><a href="../douay/num005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> The unclean are removed out of the camp: confession of sins, and satisfaction: firstfruits and oblations belonging to the priests: trial of jealousy.
<br><a href="../douay/num006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> The law of the Nazarites: the form of blessing the people.
<br><a href="../douay/num007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> The offerings of the princes at the dedication of the tabernacle. God speaketh to Moses from the propitiatory.
<br><a href="../douay/num008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> The seven lamps are placed on the golden candlestick, to shine towards the loaves of proposition: the ordination of the Levites: and to what age they shall serve in the tabernacle.
<br><a href="../douay/num009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> The precept of the pasch is renewed: the unclean and travellers are to observe it the second month: the camp is guided by the pillar of the cloud.
<br><a href="../douay/num010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> The silver trumpets and their use. They march from Sinai.
<br><a href="../douay/num011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> The people murmur and are punished with fire. God appointeth seventy ancients for assistants to Moses. They prophesy. The people have their fill of flesh, but forthwith many die of the plague.
<br><a href="../douay/num012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> Mary and Aaron murmur against Moses, whom God praiseth above other prophets. Mary being struck with leprosy, Aaron confesseth his fault. Moses prayeth for her, and after seven days' separation from the camp, she is restored.
<br><a href="../douay/num013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> The twelve spies are sent to view the land. The relation they make of it.
<br><a href="../douay/num014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> The people murmur. God threateneth to destroy them. He is appeased by Moses, yet so as to exclude the murmurers from entering the promised land. The authors of the sedition are struck dead. The rest going to fight against the will of God are beaten.
<br><a href="../douay/num015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> Certain laws concerning sacrifices. Sabbath breaking is punished with death. The law of fringes on their garments.
<br><a href="../douay/num016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> The schism of Core and his adherents: their punishment.
<br><a href="../douay/num017.htm"><strong>Chapter 17.</strong></a> The priesthood is confirmed to Aaron by the miracle of the blooming of his rod, which is kept for a monument in the tabernacle.
<br><a href="../douay/num018.htm"><strong>Chapter 18.</strong></a> The charge of the priests and of the Levites, and their portion.
<br><a href="../douay/num019.htm"><strong>Chapter 19.</strong></a> The law of the sacrifice of the red cow, and the water of expiation.
<br><a href="../douay/num020.htm"><strong>Chapter 20.</strong></a> The death of Mary the sister of Moses. The people murmur for want of water: God giveth it them from the rock. The death of Aaron.
<br><a href="../douay/num021.htm"><strong>Chapter 21.</strong></a> King Arad is overcome. The people murmur and are punished with fiery serpents: they are healed by the brazen serpent. They conquer the kings Sehon and Og.
<br><a href="../douay/num022.htm"><strong>Chapter 22.</strong></a> Balac, king of Moab, sendeth twice for Balaam to curse Israel. In his way Balaam is rebuked by an angel.
<br><a href="../douay/num023.htm"><strong>Chapter 23.</strong></a> Balaam, instead of cursing Israel, is obliged to bless them, and prophesy good things of them.
<br><a href="../douay/num024.htm"><strong>Chapter 24.</strong></a> Balaam still continues to prophesy good things in favour of Israel.
<br><a href="../douay/num025.htm"><strong>Chapter 25.</strong></a> The people fall into fornication and idolatry; for which twenty-four thousand are slain. The zeal of Phinees.

<br><a href="../douay/num033.htm"><strong>Chapter 33.</strong></a> The mansions or journeys of the children of Israel towards the land of promise.
<br><a href="../douay/num034.htm"><strong>Chapter 34.</strong></a> The limits of Chanaan; with the names of the men that make the division of it.

<br><a href="../douay/num036.htm"><strong>Chapter 36.</strong></a> That the inheritances may not be alienated from one tribe to another, all are to marry within their own tribes.
