<div class="h1a">The silver trumpets and their use. They march from Sinai.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver, wherewith thou mayest call together the multitude when the camp is to be removed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when thou shalt sound the trumpets, all the multitude shall gather unto thee to the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> If thou sound but once, the princes and the heads of the multitude of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall come to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But if the sound of the trumpets be longer, and with interruptions, they that are on the east side, shall first go forward.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And at the second sounding and like noise of the trumpet, they who lie on the south side shall take up their tents. And after this manner shall the rest do, when the trumpets shall sound for a march.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But when the people is to be gathered together, the sound of the trumpets shall be plain, and they shall not make a broken sound.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall sound the trumpets: and this shall be an ordinance for ever in your <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If you go forth to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> out of your land against the enemies that fight against you, you shall sound aloud with the trumpets, and there shall be a remembrance of you before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>, that you may be delivered out of the hands of your enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> If at any time you shall have a banquet, and on your festival days, and on the first days of your months, you shall sound the trumpets over the <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of peace <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a>, that they may be to you for a remembrance of your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> The second year, in the second month, the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> marched by their troops from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Sinai</a>, and the cloud rested in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> of Pharan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the first went forward according to the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">sons of Juda</a> by their troops: whose prince was Nahasson the son of Aminadab.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> In the <a href="../cathen/08201a.htm">tribe of the sons of Issachar</a>, the prince was Nathanael the son of Suar.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> In the <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">tribe of Zabulon</a>, the prince was Eliab the son of Helon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> was taken down, and the sons of Gerson and Merari set forward, bearing it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">sons of Ruben</a> also marched, by their troops and ranks, whose prince was Helisur the son of Sedeur.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">tribe of Simeon</a>, the prince was Salamiel the son of Surisaddai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">tribe of Gad</a>, the prince was Eliasaph the son of Duel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Then the Caathites also marched carrying the sanctuary. So long was the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> carried, till they came to the place of setting it up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The sons of Ephraim also moved their camp by their troops, in whose army the prince was Elisama the son of Ammiud.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And in the tribe of the sons of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, the prince was Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>, the prince was Abidan the son of Gedeon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The last of all the camp marched the <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">sons of Dan</a> by their troops, in whose army the prince was Ahiezer the son of Ammisaddai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">tribe of the sons of Aser</a>, the prince was Phegiel the son of Ochran.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And in the <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">tribe of the sons of Nephtali</a>, the prince was Ahira the son of Enan.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> This was the order of the camps, and marches of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> by their troops, when they set forward.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to Hobab the son of Raguel the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianite</a>, his kinsman: We are going towards the place which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will give us: come with us, that we may do thee <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But he answered him: I will not go with thee, but I will return to my country, wherein I was born.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And he said: Do not leave us: for thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowest</a> in what places we should encamp in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and thou shalt be our guide.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And if thou comest with us, we will give thee what is the best of the riches which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall deliver to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> So they marched from the <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">mount of the Lord</a> three days' journey, and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of the covenant of the Lord</a> went before them, for three days providing a place for the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> The cloud also of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was over them by day when they marched.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And when the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark</a> was lifted up, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: Arise, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and let thy enemies be scattered, and let them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> thee, flee from before thy face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And when it was set down, he said: Return, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, to the multitude of the host of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></p>
