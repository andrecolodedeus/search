<div class="h1a">The people murmur and are punished with fire. God appoints seventy ancients for assistants to Moses. They prophesy. The people have their fill of flesh, but forthwith many die of the plague.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as it were repining at their fatigue. And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard it he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. And the fire of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> being kindled against them, devoured them that were at the uttermost part of the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And when the people cried to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the fire was swallowed up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place, <em>The burning</em>: for that the fire of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had been kindled against them. <span class="stiki"><strong>The burning...</strong> <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, <em>Taberah</em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For a mixt multitude of people, that came up with them, burned with desire, sitting and weeping, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> also being joined with them, and said: Who shall give us flesh to eat? <span class="stiki"><strong>A mixt multitude...</strong> These were people that came with them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who were not of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">race of Israel</a>; who, by their murmuring, drew also the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> to murmur: this should teach us the danger of associating ourselves with the children of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that is, with the lovers and admirers of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> world.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> We remember the fish that we ate in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> free cost: the cucumbers come into our mind, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is dry, our eyes behold nothing else but <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> was like coriander seed, of the colour of bdellium. <span class="stiki"><strong>Bdellium...</strong> <em>Bdellium</em>, according to Pliny, 1.21, c. 9. was of the colour of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> nail, white and bright.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made cakes thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> also fell with it.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> heard the people weeping by their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, every one at the door of his tent. And the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was exceedingly enkindled: to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also the thing seemed insupportable.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? Wherefore do I not find favour before thee? And why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them, that thou shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the land, for which thou hast sworn to their fathers?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude? They weep against me, saying: Give us flesh that we may eat.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I beseech thee to kill me, and let me find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in thy eyes, that I be not afflicted with so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Gather unto me seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the people: and thou shalt bring them to the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>, and shalt make them stand there with thee, <span class="stiki"><strong>Seventy men...</strong> This was the first institution of the council or senate, called the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>, consisting of seventy or seventy-two senators or counsellors.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> That I may come down and speak with thee: and I will take of thy <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a>, and will give to them, that they may bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou mayest not be burthened alone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And thou shalt say to the people: Be ye <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>: tomorrow you shall eat flesh: for I have heard you say: Who will give us flesh to eat? It was well with us in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. That the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may give you flesh, and you may eat:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor ten, no nor for twenty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But even for a month of days, till it come out at your nostrils, and become loathsome to you, because you have cast off the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who is in the midst of you, and have wept before him, saying: Why came we out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: There are six hundred thousand footmen of this people, and sayest thou: I will give them flesh to eat a whole month?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed, that it may suffice for their food? or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered together to fill them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> answered him: Is the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> unable? Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore came, and told the people the words of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and assembled seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and made them to stand about the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, taking away of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> that was in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and giving to the seventy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> had rested on them they <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a>, nor did they cease afterwards.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Now there remained in the camp two of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of whom one was called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a> rested; for they also had been enrolled, but were not gone forth to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when they <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesied</a> in the camp, there ran a young man, and told <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying: Eldad and Medad <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> in the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Forthwith <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>, the minister of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and chosen out of many, said: My lord <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> forbid them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But he said: Why hast thou emulation for me? O that all the people might <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> would give them his <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit</a>!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> returned, with the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, into the camp.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And a wind going out from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, taking quails up beyond the sea brought them, and cast them into the camp for the space of one day's journey, on every side of the camp round about, and they flew in the air two cubits high above the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> The people therefore rising up all that day, and night, and the next day, gathered together of quails, he that did least, ten cores: and they dried them round about the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> As yet the flesh was between their teeth, neither had that kind of meat failed: when behold the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> being provoked against the people, struck them with an exceeding great plague.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And that place was called, <em>The graves of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a></em>: for there they buried the people that had <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusted</a>. And departing from the graves of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, they came unto Haseroth, and abode there. <span class="stiki"><strong>The graves of lust...</strong> Or, the sepulchres of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>: so called from their irregular desire of flesh. In <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, <em>Kibroth. Hattaavah</em>.</span></span></p>
