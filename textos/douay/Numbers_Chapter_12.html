<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Mary and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> spoke against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, because of his wife the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a>, <span class="stiki"><strong>Ethiopian...</strong> Sephora the wife of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, which bordered upon the land of <a href="../cathen/04575c.htm">Chus</a> or <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>: where note, that the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> here spoken of is not that of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> but that of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they said: Hath the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoken by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> only? Hath he not also spoken to us in like manner? And when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard this,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> (For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> exceeding <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">meek</a> above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that dwelt upon earth) <span class="stiki"><strong>Exceeding meek...</strong> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> being the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">meekest</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, would not contend for himself; therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> him to write here his own defence: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whose dictate he wrote, obliged him to declare the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, though it was so much to his own praise.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Immediately he spoke to him, and to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and Mary: Come out you three only to the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>. And when they were come out,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> came down in a <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of the cloud</a>, and stood in the entry of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> calling to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and Mary. And when they were come,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He said to them: Hear my words: if there be among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, I will appear to him in a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>, or I will speak to him in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But it is not so with my servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who is most <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> in all my house:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For I speak to him mouth to mouth: and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Why then were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them he went away:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The cloud also that was over the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> departed: and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. And when <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> had looked on her, and saw her all covered with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which we have foolishly committed:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Let her not be as one dead, and as an <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortive</a> that is cast forth from the mother's womb. Lo, now one half of her flesh is consumed with the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, saying O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I beseech thee heal her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> answered him: If her father had spitten upon her face, ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least? Let her be separated seven days without the camp, and afterwards she shall be called again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days: and the people moved not from that place until Mary was called again.</span></p>
