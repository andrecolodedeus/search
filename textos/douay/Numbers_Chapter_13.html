<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sent them to view the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and said to them: Go you up by the south side. And when you shall come to the mountains,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> View the land, of what sort it is, and the people that are the inhabitants thereof, whether they be strong or weak: few in number or many:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The land itself, whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or bad: what manner of cities, walled or without walls:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The ground, fat or barren, woody or without trees. Be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and bring us of the fruits of the land. Now it was the time when the firstripe grapes are fit to be eaten.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when they were gone up, they viewed the land from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they went up at the south side, and came to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac. For <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> was built seven years before <a href="../cathen/14443b.htm">Tanis</a> the city of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes, they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes, which two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> carried upon a lever. They took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Which was called Nehelescol, that is to say, the torrent of the cluster of grapes, because from thence the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> had carried a cluster of grapes.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days, having gone round all the country,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And came to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and to all the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Pharan, which is in <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>. And speaking to them and to all the multitude, they showed them the fruits of the land:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they related and said: We came into the land to which thou sentest us, which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as may be known by these fruits:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> But it hath very strong inhabitants, and the cities are great and walled. We saw there the race of Enac.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a> dwelleth in the south, the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hethite</a> and the Jebusite and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a> in the mountains: but the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> abideth by the sea and near the streams of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> In the mean time <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>, to still the murmuring of the people that rose against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, said: Let us go up and possess the land, for we shall be able to conquer it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But the others, that had been with him, said: No, we are not able to go up to this people, because they are stronger than we.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they spoke ill of the land, which they had viewed, before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, saying: The land which we have viewed, devoureth its inhabitants: the people, that we beheld are of a tall stature. <span class="stiki"><strong>Spoke ill, etc...</strong> These <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who by their misrepresentations of the land of promise, discouraged the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> from attempting the conquest of it, were a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of worldlings, who, by decrying or misrepresenting <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> devotion, discourage <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from seeking in earnest and acquiring so great a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and thereby securing to themselves a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">happy eternity</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> There we saw certain monsters of the sons of Enac, of the giant kind: in comparison of whom, we seemed like locusts.</span></p>
