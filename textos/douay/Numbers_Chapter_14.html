<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> murmured against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that we had died in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: and would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we may die in this vast <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> may not bring us into this land, lest we fall by the sword, and our wives and children be led away <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">captives</a>. Is it not better to return into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they said one to another: Let us appoint a <a href="../cathen/03314c.htm">captain</a>, and let us return into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> heard this, they fell down flat upon the ground before the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb the son of Jephone</a>, who themselves also had viewed the land, rent their garments,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And said to all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>: The land which we have gone round is very <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> If the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be favourable, he will bring us into it, and give us a land flowing with milk and honey.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: How long will this people detract me? how long will they not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me for all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> that I have wrought before them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I will strike them therefore with pestilence, and will consume them: but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation, and a mightier than this is.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> May hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it were one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and may say:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He could not bring the people into the land for which he had sworn, therefore did he kill them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Let then the strength of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be magnified, as thou hast sworn, saying:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Forgive, I beseech thee, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of this people, according to the greatness of thy mercy, as thou hast been merciful to them from their going out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> unto this place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said: I have forgiven according to thy word.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But yet all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that have seen my majesty, and the signs that I have done in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> me now ten times, and have not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> my voice,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Shall not see the land for which I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to their fathers, neither shall any one of them that hath detracted me behold it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> My servant <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a>, who being full of another <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> hath followed me, I will bring into this land which he hath gone round: and his seed shall possess it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For the <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecite</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> dwell in the valleys.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> How long doth this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> multitude murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Say therefore to them: As I live, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: According as you have spoken in my hearing, so will I do to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> In the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> shall your carcasses lie. All you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, and have murmured against me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Shall not enter into the land, over which I lifted up my hand to make you dwell therein, except <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb the son of Jephone</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> But your children, of whom you said, that they should be a prey to the enemies, will I bring in: that they may see the land which you have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Your carcasses shall lie in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Your children shall wander in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> forty years, and shall bear your fornication, until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, <span class="stiki"><strong>Shall bear your fornication...</strong> That is, shall bear the punishment of your disloyalty to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> language is here called a fornication, in a spiritual sense.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> According to the number of the forty days, wherein you viewed the land: a year shall be counted for a day. And forty years you shall receive your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>, and shall know my revenge:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> For as I have spoken, so will I do to all this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> multitude, that hath risen up together against me: in this <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> shall it faint away and die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Therefore all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had sent to view the land, and who at their return had made the whole multitude to murmur against him, speaking ill of the land that it was naught,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Died and were struck in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb</a> had gone to view the land.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke all these words to all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and the people mourned exceedingly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And behold rising up very early in the morning, they went up to the top of the mountain, and said: We are ready to go up to the place, of which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken: for we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to them: Why transgress you the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>, which shall not succeed prosperously with you?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> Go not up, for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is not with you: lest you fall before your enemies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> The <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecite</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> are before you, and by their sword you shall fall, because you would not consent to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, neither will the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> But they being blinded went up to the top of the mountain.
