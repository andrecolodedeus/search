<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Rose up against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and with them two hundred and fifty others of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, leading <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and who in the time of assembly were called by <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Rose up...</strong> The crime of these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which was punished in so remarkable a manner, was that of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and of rebellion against the authority established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>; and their pretending to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> without being lawfully <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">called and sent</a>: the same is the case of all modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">sectaries</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when they had stood up against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, they said: Let it be enough for you, that all the multitude consisteth of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is among them: Why lift you up yourselves above the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> When <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> heard this, he fell flat on his face:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And speaking to <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a> and all the multitude, he said: In the morning the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will make known who belong to him, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> he will join to himself: and whom he shall choose, they shall approach to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Do this therefore: Take every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of you your <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, thou <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a>, and all thy company.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And putting fire in them tomorrow, put <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> upon it before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and whomsoever he shall choose, the same shall be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: you take too much upon you, ye <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he said again to <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a>: Hear ye <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Is it a small thing unto you, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hath spared you from all the people, and joined you to himself, that you should serve him in the service of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, and should stand before the congregation of the people, and should minister to him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">sons of Levi</a> to approach unto him, that you should challenge to yourselves the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> also,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And that all thy company should stand against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>? for what is <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> that you murmur against him?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sent to call <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Dathan and Abiron</a> the sons of Eliab. But they answered: We will not come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Is it a small matter to thee, that thou hast brought us out of a land that flowed with milk and honey, to kill us in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, except thou rule also like a lord over us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Thou hast brought us indeed into a land that floweth with rivers of milk and honey, and hast given us possessions of fields and vineyards; wilt thou also pull out our eyes? We will not come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore being very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: Respect not their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: thou knowest that I have not taken of them so much as a young ass at any time, nor have injured any of them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Very angry...</strong> This <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and an indignation at the affront offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; like that which the same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> conceived upon the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calf</a> [<a href="../douay/exo032.htm#verse19">Exodus 32:19</a>].</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a>: Do thou and thy congregation stand apart before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> tomorrow, and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> apart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Take every one of you <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, and put <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> upon them, <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> two hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>: let <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> also hold his <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> When they had done this, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> standing,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And had drawn up all the multitude against them to the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared to them all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> speaking to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may presently destroy them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> They fell flat on their face, and said: O most mighty, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> of all flesh, for one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> rage against all?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Command the whole people to separate themselves from the tents of <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core and Dathan and Abiron</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> arose, and went to <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Dathan and Abiron</a>: and the ancients of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> following him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> He said to the multitude: Depart from the tents of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when they were departed from their tents round about, <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Dathan and Abiron</a> coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions with their wives and children, and all the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said: By this you shall know that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath sent me to do all things that you see, and that I have not forged them of my own head:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> If these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> die the common death of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and if they be visited with a plague, wherewith others also are wont to be visited, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> did not send me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But if the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> do a new thing, and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down, and all things that belong to them, and they go down alive into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, you shall know that they have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And immediately as he had made an end of speaking, the earth broke asunder under their feet:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And opening her mouth, devoured them with their tents and all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">substance</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they went down alive into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, the ground closing upon them, and they perished from among the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> But all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that was standing round about, fled at the cry of them that were perishing: saying: Lest perhaps the earth swallow us up also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And a fire coming out from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, destroyed the two hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that offered the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> In the deaths of the sinners: and let him beat them into plates, and fasten them to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, because <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> hath been offered in them to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and they are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> may see them for a sign and a memorial.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Then <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> took the brazen <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a>, wherein they had offered, whom the burning fire had devoured, and beat them into plates, fastening them to the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> That the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> might have for the time to come wherewith they should be admonished, that no stranger or any one that is not of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> should come near to offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, lest he should suffer as <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a> suffered, and all his congregation, according as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> The following day all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> murmured against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, saying: You have killed the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> And when there arose a sedition, and the tumult increased,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>:</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> When <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> had done this, and had run to the midst of the multitude which the burning fire was now destroying, he offered the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>:</span>
