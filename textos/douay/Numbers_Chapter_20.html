<div class="h1a">The death of Mary the sister of Moses. The people murmur for want of water: God gives it them from the rock. The death of Aaron.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and all the multitude came into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Sin, in the first month: and the people abode in <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>. And Mary died there, and was buried in the same place.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the people wanting water, came together against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And making a sedition, they said: Would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we had perished among our brethren before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Why have you brought out the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, that both we and our cattle should die?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Why have you made us come up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and have brought us into this wretched place which cannot be sowed, nor bringeth forth figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> leaving the multitude, went into the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>, and fell flat upon the ground, and cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and said. O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, hear the cry of this people, and open to them thy treasure, a fountain of living water, that being satisfied, they may cease to murmur. And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> appeared over them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Take the rod, and assemble the people together, thou and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> thy brother, and speak to the rock before them, and it shall yield waters. And when thou hast brought forth water out of the rock, all the multitude and their cattle shall drink.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore took the rod, which was before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, as he had commanded him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And having gathered together the multitude before the rock, he said to them: Hear, ye rebellious and incredulous: Can we bring you forth water out of this rock?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> bad lifted up his hand, and struck the rock twice with the rod, there came forth water in great abundance, so that the people and their cattle drank, <span class="stiki"><strong>The rock...</strong> This rock was a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the water that issued out from the rock, of his precious blood, the source of all our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: Because you have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> me, to sanctify me before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, you shall not bring these people into the land, which I will give them. <span class="stiki"><strong>You have not believed, etc...</strong> The fault of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, on this occasion, was a certain diffidence and weakness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; not doubting of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power or veracity; but apprehending the unworthiness of that rebellious and incredulous people, and therefore speaking with some ambiguity.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> This is the <em>Water of contradiction</em>, where the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> strove with words against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> in them. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Water of contradiction...</strong> Or strife. <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, <em>Meribah</em>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> In the mean time <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sent messengers from <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a> to the king of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, to say: Thus saith thy brother <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: Thou knowest all the labour that hath come upon us:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> In what manner our fathers went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and there we dwelt a long time, and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> afflicted us and our fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And how we cried to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and he heard us, and sent an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who hath brought us out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Lo, we are now in the <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">city of Cades</a>, which is in the uttermost of thy borders,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy country. We will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, we will not drink the waters of thy <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">wells</a>, but we will go by the common highway, neither turning aside to the right hand, nor to the left, till we are past thy borders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> answered them: Thou shalt not pass by me: if thou dost I will come out armed against thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> said: We will go by the beaten way: and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters, we will give thee what is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: there shall be no difficulty in the price, only let us pass speedily.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But he answered: Thou shalt not pass. And immediately he came forth to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong hand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Neither would he condescend to their desire to grant them passage through his borders. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> turned another way from him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when they had removed the camp from <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a>, they came to mount Hor, which is in the borders of the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">land of Edom</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Where the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Let <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, saith he, go to his people: for he shall not go into the land which I have given the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, because he was incredulous to my words, at the <em>waters of contradiction</em>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Take <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and his son with him, and bring them up into mount Hor:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And when thou hast stripped the father of his <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vesture</a>, thou shalt <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vest</a> therewith <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> his son: <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> shall be gathered to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">people</a>, and die there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded: and they went up into mount Hor before all the multitude.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And when he had stripped <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, he vested <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> his son with them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> being dead in the top of the mountain, he came down with <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And all the multitude seeing that <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was dead, mourned for him thirty days throughout all their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>.</span></p>
