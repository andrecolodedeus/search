<div class="h1a">King Arad is overcome. The people murmur and are punished with fiery serpents: they are healed by the brazen serpent. They conquer the kings Sehon and Og.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when king Arad the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, who dwelt towards the south, had heard this, to wit, that <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was come by the way of the spies, he fought against them, and overcoming them carried off their spoils.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> binding himself by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, said: If thou wilt deliver thus people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and delivered up the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and they cut them off and destroyed their cities: and they called the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of that place Horma, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">Anathema</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Anathema...</strong> That is, a thing devoted to utter destruction.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, to compass the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">land of Edom</a>. And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And speaking against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, they said: Why didst thou bring us out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to die in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>? There is no bread, nor have we any waters: our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> now loatheth this very light food. <span class="stiki"><strong>Very light food...</strong> So they call the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a>: thus worldlings loathe the things of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, for which they have no relish.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> sent among the people fiery serpents, which bit them and killed many of them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Fiery serpents...</strong> They are so called, because they that were bitten by them were burnt with a violent heat.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Upon which they came to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and said; We have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, because we have spoken against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and thee: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that he may take away these serpents from us. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: Make a brazen serpent, and set it up for a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">sign</a>: whosoever being struck shall look on it, shall live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore made a brazen serpent, and set it up for a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">sign</a>: which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were healed. <span class="stiki"><strong>A brazen serpent...</strong> This was a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified, and of the efficacy of a lively <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in him, against the bites of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">hellish serpent</a>. <a href="../douay/joh003.htm#verse14">John 3:14</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> setting forwards camped in Oboth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And departing thence they pitched their tents in Jeabarim, in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, that faceth <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> toward the east.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And removing from thence, they came to the torrent Zared:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Which they left and encamped over against Arnon, which is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and standeth out on the borders of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>. For Arnon is the border of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, dividing the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Wherefore it is said in the book of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> As he did in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, so will he do in the streams of Arnon. <span class="stiki"><strong>The book of the wars, etc...</strong> An ancient book, which, like several others quoted in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>, has been lost.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in Ar, and lie down in the borders of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> When they went from that place, the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> appeared whereof the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> sung this song:</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem">Let the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a> spring up.</blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose">They sung thereto:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">well</a>, which the princes dug, and the chiefs of the people prepared by the direction of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">lawgiver</a>, and with their staves. And they marched from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> to Mathana.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> From Mathana unto Nahaliel: from Nahaliel unto Bamoth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> From Bamoth, is a valley in the country of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, to the top of <a href="../cathen/11791a.htm">Phasga</a>, which looked towards the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> sent messengers to Sehon king of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land: we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards, we will not drink waters of the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">wells</a>, we will go the king's highway, till we be past thy borders.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he would not grant that <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> should pass by his borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and came to Jasa and fought against them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the confines of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>: for the borders of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>, were kept with a strong garrison.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> So <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>, to wit, in <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a> was the city of Sehon the king of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, who fought against the king of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: and took all the land, that had been of his dominion, as far as the Arnon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Therefore it is said in the proverb:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Come into <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, let the city of Sehon be built and set up:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> A fire is gone out of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, a flame from the city of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>, and the inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Woe to thee <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>: thou art undone, O people of Chamos.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Their yoke is perished from <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a> unto <a href="../cathen/04777b.htm">Dibon</a>, they came weary to Nophe, and unto Medaba.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> dwelt in the land of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sent some to take a view of Jazer: and they took the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">villages</a> of it, and conquered the inhabitants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And they turned themselves, and went up by the way of Basan, and Og the king of Basan came against them with all his people, to fight in Edrai.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people, and his country into thy hand: and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, the inhabitant of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> So they slew him also with his sons, and all his people, not letting any one escape, and they possessed his land.</span></p>
