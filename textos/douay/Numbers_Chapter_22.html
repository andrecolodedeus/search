<div class="h1a">Balac, king of Moab, sends twice for Balaam to curse Israel. In his way Balaam is rebuked by an angel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And they went forward and encamped in the plains of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, over against where <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> is situate beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had done to the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhite</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And that the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> were in great fear of him, and were not able to sustain his assault,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He said to the elders of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>: So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He sent therefore messengers to <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam the son of Beor</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">soothsayer</a>, who dwelt by the river of the land of the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">children of Ammon</a>, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Come therefore, and <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> this people, because it is mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, and he whom thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> is <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the ancients of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, and the elders of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, went with the price of <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> in their hands. And where they were come to <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, and had told him all the words of Balac:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He answered: Tarry here this night and I will answer whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall say to me. And while they stayed with <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came and said to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> What mean these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are with thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> hath sent to me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Saying: Behold a people that is come out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, hath covered the face of the land: come and <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> them, if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>: Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt thou <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> the people: because it is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go into your country, because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath forbid me to come with you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The princes returning, said to Balac: <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> would not come with us.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Who, when they were come to <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, said: Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For I am ready to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> thee, and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt: come and <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> this people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> answered: If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to speak either more or less.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you to stay here this night also, that I may know what the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> will answer me once more. <span class="stiki"><strong>To stay...</strong> His desiring them to stay, after he had been fully informed already that it was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> he should go, came from the inclination he had to gratify Balac, for the sake of worldly gain. And this perverse disposition <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punished by permitting him to go (though not to <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> the people as he would willingly have done), and suffering him to fall still deeper and deeper into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, till he came at last to give that abominable counsel against the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which ended in his own destruction. So sad a thing it is to indulge a <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> for money.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> therefore came to <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> in the night, and said to him: If these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> be come to call thee, arise and go with them: yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. And an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> stood in the way against <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The ass seeing the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> standing in the way, with a drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went into the field. And when <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> beat her, and had a mind to bring her again to the way,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> stood in a narrow place between two walls, wherewith the vineyards were enclosed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall, and bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her again:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> going on to a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, stood to meet him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And when the ass saw the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> standing, she fell under the feet of the rider: who being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> beat her sides more vehemently with a staff.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> opened the mouth of the ass, and she said: What have I done to thee? Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third time? <span class="stiki"><strong>Opened the mouth, etc...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> moved the tongue of the ass, to utter these speeches, to rebuke, by the mouth of a brute beast, the brutal fury and folly of <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> answered: Because thou hast deserved it, and hast served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Forthwith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> opened the eyes of <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, and he saw the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">worshipped</a> him falling flat on the ground.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him: Why beatest thou thy ass these three times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse, and contrary to me: <span class="stiki"><strong>Perverse...</strong> Because thy inclinations are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in being willing for the sake of gain to <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> the people of whom I am the <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she should have lived.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> said: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, not knowing that thou didst stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I go, I will return.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said: Go with these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee. He went therefore with the princes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>, that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And he said to <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>: I sent messengers to call thee, why didst thou not come immediately to me? was it because I am not able to reward thy coming?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall put in my mouth?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> So they went on together, and came into a city, that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent presents to <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, and to the princes that were with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And when morning was come, he brought him to the high places of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and he beheld the uttermost part of the people.</span></p>
