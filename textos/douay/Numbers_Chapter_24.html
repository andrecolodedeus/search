<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> saw that it pleased the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that he should <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, he went not as he had gone before, to seek <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>: but setting his face towards the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And lifting up his eyes, he saw <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> abiding in their tents by their <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a> rushing upon him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He took up his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> and said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam the son of Beor</a> hath said: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath said, whose eye is stopped up:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The bearer of the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath said, he that hath beheld the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty</a>, he that falleth, and so his eyes are opened:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> How beautiful are thy tabernacles O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and thy tents, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>!</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> As woody valleys, as watered gardens near the rivers, as tabernacles which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath pitched, as <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a> by the waterside.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be in many waters. For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom shall be taken away.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none shall dare to rouse. He that <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesseth</a> thee, shall also himself be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>: he that <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curseth</a> thee shall be reckoned <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">accursed</a>.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Balac being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>, clapped his hands together and said: I called thee to <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> my enemies, and thou on the contrary hast <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> them three times.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Return to thy place. I had determined indeed greatly to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> thee, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath deprived thee of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> designed for thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> made answer to Balac: Did I not say to thy messengers, whom thou sentest to me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to utter any thing of my own head either <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: but whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall say, that I will speak?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Therefore taking up his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, again he said:</p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he shall possess <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Idumea</a>: the inheritance of Seir shall come to their enemies, but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall do manfully.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a> shall he come that shall rule, and shall destroy the remains of the city.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And when he saw <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, he took up his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and said: <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a> the beginning of nations, whose latter ends shall be destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> He saw also the <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cinite</a>: and took up his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and said:</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Thy habitation indeed is strong: but though thou build thy nest in a rock,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And thou be chosen of the stock of <a href="../cathen/03776b.htm">Cin</a>, how long shalt thou be able to continue?

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And taking up his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, again he said:</p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> They shall come in galleys from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, they shall overcome the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and shall waste the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Hebrews</a>, and at the last they themselves also shall perish.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> rose, and returned to his place: Balac also returned the way that he came.</span></p>
