<h1>Numbers Chapter 27</h1>
<div class="h1a">The law of inheritance. Joshua is appointed to succeed Moses.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then came the daughters of Salphaad, the son of Hepher, the son of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, who was the son of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: and their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> are Maala, and Noa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Thersa.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they stood before <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and all the princes of the people at the door of the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of the covenant</a>, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Our father died in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and was not in the sedition, that was raised against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> under <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a>, but he died in his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: and he had no male children. Why is his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> taken away out of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, because he had no son? Give us a possession among the kinsmen of our father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> referred their cause to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The daughters of Salphaad demand a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> thing: Give them a possession among their father's kindred, and let them succeed him in his inheritance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> thou shalt speak these things:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> When a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dieth without a son, his inheritance shall pass to his daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If he have no daughter, his brethren shall succeed him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And if he have no brethren, you shall give the inheritance to his father's brethren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But if he have no uncles by the father, the inheritance shall be given to them that are the next akin. And this shall be to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sacred</a> by a perpetual <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> also said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: Go up into this mountain <a href="../cathen/01006c.htm">Abarim</a>, and view from thence the land which I will give to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when thou shalt have seen it, thou also shalt go to thy people, as thy brother <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> is gone:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Because you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">offended</a> me in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Sin in the contradiction of the multitude, neither would you <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">sanctify</a> me before them at the waters. These are the <em>waters of contradiction</em> in <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cades</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Sin.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> answered him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> May the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> of all flesh provide a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that may be over this multitude:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And may go out and in before them, and may lead them out, or bring them in: lest the people of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be as sheep without a shepherd.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to him: take <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in whom is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">put thy hand</a> upon him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he shall stand before <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and all the multitude:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And thou shalt give him <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> in the sight of all, and part of thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that all the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> may hear him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> If any thing be to be done, <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall consult the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> for him. He and all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> with him, and the rest of the multitude shall go out and go in at his word.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded. And, when he had taken <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>, he set him before <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and all the assembly of the people,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying his hands</a> on his head, he repeated all things that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had commanded.</span></p>
