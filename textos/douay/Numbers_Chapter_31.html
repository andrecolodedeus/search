<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when they had fought against the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianites</a> and had overcome them, they slew all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And their kings Evi, and Recem, and Sur, and Hur, and Rebe, five princes of the nation: <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> also the son of Beor they killed with the sword.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they took their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and their children <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">captives</a>, and all their cattle, and all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>: and all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">possessions</a> they plundered:</span>
