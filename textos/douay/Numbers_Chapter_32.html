<div class="h1a">The tribes of Ruben and Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh, receive their inheritance on the east side of Jordan, upon conditions approved of by Moses.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the sons of <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> and <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a> had many flocks of cattle, and their substance in beasts was infinite. And when they saw the lands of Jazer and Galaad fit for feeding cattle,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> They came to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the princes of the multitude, and said:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Ataroth, and <a href="../cathen/04777b.htm">Dibon</a>, and Jazer, and Nemra, <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and Eleale, and Saban, and <a href="../cathen/10666a.htm">Nebo</a>, and Beon,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The land, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath conquered in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, is a very fertile soil for the feeding of beasts: and we thy servants have very much cattle:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And we pray thee, if we have found favour in thy sight, that thou give it to us thy servants in possession, and make us not pass over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> answered them: What, shall your brethren go to fight, and will you sit here?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Why do ye overturn the minds of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, that they may not dare to pass into the place which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath given them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Was it not thus your fathers did, when I sent from <a href="../cathen/03130a.htm">Cadesbarne</a> to view the land?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when they were come as far as the valley of the cluster, having viewed all the country, they overturned the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, that they should not enter into the coasts, which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that came up out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land, which I <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>: because they would not follow me,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Except <a href="../cathen/03157a.htm">Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>: these have fulfilled my <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, led them about through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> forty years, until the whole <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, that had done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his sight, was consumed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And behold, said he, you are risen up instead of your fathers, the increase and offspring of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to augment the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For if you will not follow him, he will leave the people in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, and you shall be the cause of the destruction of all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But they coming near, said: We will make sheepfolds, and stalls for our cattle, and strong cities for our children:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And we ourselves will go armed and ready for battle before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, until we bring them in unto their places. Our little ones, and all we have, shall be in walled cities, for fear of the ambushes of the inhabitants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> We will not return into our houses until the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> possess their inheritance:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Neither will we seek any thing beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, because we have already our possession on the east side thereof,</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said to them: If you do what you promise, go on well appointed for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And let every fighting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> pass over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, until the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> overthrow his enemies:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And all the land be brought under him, then shall you be blameless before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> and before <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and you shall obtain the countries that you desire, before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But if you do not what you say, no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can doubt but you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and know ye, that your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall overtake you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Build therefore cities for your children, and folds and stalls for your sheep and beasts, and accomplish what you have promised.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">children of Gad</a> and <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: We are thy servants, we will do what my lord commandeth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> We will leave our children, and our wives and sheep and cattle, in the cities of Galaad:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And we thy servants all well appointed will march on to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, as thou, my lord, speakest.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore commanded <a href="../cathen/05373b.htm">Eleazar</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua the son of Nun</a>, and the princes of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes of Israel</a>, and said to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> If the <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">children of Gad</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">children of Ruben</a> pass with you over the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, all armed for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the land be made subject to you: give them Galaad in possession.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But if they will not pass armed with you into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, let them receive places to dwell in among you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">children of Gad</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">children of Ruben</a> answered: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath spoken to his servants, so will we do:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> We will go armed before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> into the land of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and we confess that we have already received our possession beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> therefore gave to the <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">children of Gad</a> and of <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph</a>, the kingdom of Sehon king of the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, and the kingdom of Og king of Basan, and their land and the cities thereof round about.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">sons of Gad</a> built <a href="../cathen/04777b.htm">Dibon</a>, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But the <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">children of Ruben</a> built <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and Eleale, and Cariathaim,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> Moreover the children of Machir, the son of <a href="../cathen/09583c.htm">Manasses</a>, went into Galaad, and wasted it, cutting off the <a href="../cathen/01433c.htm">Amorrhites</a>, the inhabitants thereof.</span>
