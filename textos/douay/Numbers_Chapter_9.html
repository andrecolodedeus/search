<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now on the day that the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> was reared up, a cloud covered it.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> So it was always: by day the cloud covered it, and by night as it were the appearance of fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when the cloud that covered the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> was taken up, then the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> marched forward: and in the place where the cloud stood still, there they camped.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> At the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> they marched, and at his commandment they pitched the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>. All the days that the cloud abode over the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, they remained in the same place:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And if it was so that it continued over it a long time, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> kept the watches of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and marched not,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>. At the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> they pitched their tents, and at his commandment they took them down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and immediately at break of day left the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a>, they marched forward: and if it departed after a day and a night, they took down their tents.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But if it remained over the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> for two days or a month or a longer time, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> remained in the same place, and marched not: but immediately as soon as it departed, they removed the camp.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> By the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> they pitched their tents, and by his word they marched: and kept the watches of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> according to his commandment by the hand of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></p>
