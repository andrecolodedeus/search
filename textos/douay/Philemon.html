<h1>Philemon</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Epistle of St. Paul to Philemon</div>

<p>Philemon, a noble citizen of <a href="../cathen/04131a.htm">Colossa</a>, had a servant <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Onesimus, who robbed him and fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he met <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who was then a prisoner there the first time. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> took compassion on him and received him with tenderness and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> him to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for he was a <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> before. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> sends him back to his master with this Epistle in his favour: and though he beseeches Philemon to pardon him, yet the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle</a> writes with becoming dignity and authority. It contains divers profitable instructions and points out the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and humanity that masters should have for their servants. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/11797b.htm">EPISTLE TO PHILEMON</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a prisoner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> to you and peace, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God our Father</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I give thanks to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, always making a remembrance of thee in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Hearing of thy <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which thou hast in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> and towards all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> That the communication of thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">work</a> that is in you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For I have had great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and consolation in thy <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, because the bowels of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have been refreshed by thee, brother.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Wherefore, though I have much confidence in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> to command thee that which is to the purpose:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, an old <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and now a prisoner also of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee but now is profitable both to me and thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee that thou mightest receive him again for ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me. But how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And if he hath wronged thee in any thing or is in thy debt, put that to my account.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee that thou owest me thy own self also.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->! Refresh my bowels in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Trusting in thy <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, I have written to thee: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> that through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> I shall be given unto you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark</a>, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow labourers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> be with your spirit. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
