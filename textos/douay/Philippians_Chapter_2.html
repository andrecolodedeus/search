<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Fulfil ye my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that you be of one mind, having the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Let nothing be done through contention: neither by vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, let each esteem others better than themselves:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For let this <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> be in you, which was also in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Who being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not robbery to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But <a href="../cathen/08617a.htm">emptied himself</a>, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in habit found as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Emptied himself, exinanivit...</strong> made himself as of no account.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> He <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> himself, becoming <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even to the death of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For which cause, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also hath exalted him and hath given him a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> which is above all <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> That in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a> every knee should <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bow</a>, of those that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, on earth, and under the earth:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And that every tongue should confess that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, not as in my presence only but much more now in my absence) with fear and trembling work out your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>With fear, etc...</strong> This is against the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12403b.htm">presumptuous</a> security of modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">sectaries</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> That you may be blameless and sincere children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>: among whom you shine as lights in the world.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Holding forth the word of life to my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and service of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I rejoice and congratulate with you all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And for the selfsame thing, do you also rejoice and congratulate with me.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> comfort, when I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things concerning you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For I have no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For all seek the things that are their own not the things that are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ's</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of him: that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately: so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And I trust in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> that I myself also shall come to you shortly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer and fellow soldier, but your <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>: and he that hath ministered to my wants.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had mercy on him. And not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Therefore, I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Receive him therefore with all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and treat with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> such as he is.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> Because for the work of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service.</span></p>
