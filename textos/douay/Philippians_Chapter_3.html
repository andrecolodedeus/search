<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but to you is necessary.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Beware of dogs: beware of evil workers: beware of the concision.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For we are the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, who in spirit serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, not having confidence in the flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, I more:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the eighth day, of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">stock of Israel</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>, an <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrew</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Hebrews</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> According to <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: According to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that is in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, conversing without blame.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Furthermore, I count all things to be but loss for the excellent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but as dung, that I may gain <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And may be found in him, not having my <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which is of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, but that which is of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> That I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->sufferings<!--</a>-->: being made conformable to his death,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from the dead.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect: but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also apprehended by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended. But one thing I do: Forgetting the things that are behind and stretching forth myself to those that are before,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, this also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will reveal to you,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Nevertheless, whereunto we are come, that we be of the same mind, let us also continue in the same rule.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Be ye followers of me, brethren: and observe them who walk so as you have our model.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For many walk, of whom I have told you often (and now tell you weeping) that they are enemies of the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Whose end is destruction: whose <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is their belly: and whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in their shame: who mind earthly things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But our conversation is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: from whence also we look for the Saviour, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto himself.</span></p>
