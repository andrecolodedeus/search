<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Therefore my dearly beloved brethren and most desired, my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and my crown: so stand fast in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, my dearly beloved.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I beg of Evodia and I beseech Syntyche to be of one mind in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I entreat thee also, my sincere companion, help those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who have laboured with me in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, with <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement</a> and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> are in the book of life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Rejoice in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> always: again, I say, rejoice.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Let your modesty be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> is nigh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Be nothing solicitous: but in every thing, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whatsoever modest, whatsoever <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, whatsoever <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> fame, if there be any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if any praise of discipline: think on these things. <span class="stiki"><strong>For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, etc...</strong> Here the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> enumerates general <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of morality, which they ought to practise. <strong>Whatsoever things are true...</strong> in words, in promises, in lawful <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, etc., he commands rectitude of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and sincerity of heart. <strong>Whatsoever modest...</strong> by these words he prescribes gravity in manners, modesty in dress, and decency in conversation. <strong>Whatsoever just...</strong> That is, in dealing with others, in buying or selling, in trade or business, to be fair and honest. <strong>Whatsoever holy...</strong> by these words may be understood, that those who are in a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->religious state professed<!--</a>-->, or in holy orders, should lead a life of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> they make; but these words being also applied to those in the world, indicate the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life they are bound by the divine commandments to follow. <strong>Whatsoever lovely...</strong> that is, to practise those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> offices in society, that procure us the esteem and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will of our neighbours. <strong>Whatsoever of good fame...</strong> That is, that by our conduct and behaviour we should edify our neighbours, and give them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> example by our actions. <strong>If there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline...</strong> that those in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, by seeing the morality and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> discipline of the true religion, may be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>. <strong>And finally, the apostle commands, not only the Philippians, but all Christians, to think on these things...</strong> that is, to make it their study and concern that the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might be with them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, these do ye: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace shall be with you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now I rejoice in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> exceedingly that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both how to be brought low, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to abound (every where and in all things I am instructed): both to be full and to be hungry: both to abound and to suffer need.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Nevertheless, you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And you also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippians</a>, that in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, when I departed from Macedonia, no <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For unto <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> also you sent once and again for my use.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Not that I seek the gift: but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But I have all and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of sweetness, an acceptable <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And may my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> supply all your want, according to his riches in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God and our Father</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Salute ye every saint in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The brethren who are with me salute you. All the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> salute you: especially they that are of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar's</a> household.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> be with your spirit. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
