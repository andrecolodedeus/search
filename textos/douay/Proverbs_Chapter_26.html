<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> As a bird flying to other places, and a sparrow going here or there: so a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> uttered without cause shall come upon a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>As a bird, etc...</strong> The meaning is, that a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> uttered without cause shall do no harm to the person that is <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a>, but will return upon him that <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curseth</a>, as whithersoever a bird flies, it returns to its own nest.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the back of fools.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he imagine himself to be wise.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He that sendeth words by a foolish messenger, is lame of feet and drinketh <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> As a lame <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath fair legs in vain: so a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> is unseemly in the mouth of fools.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that giveth <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to a fool.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> in the mouth of fools.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> When the wood faileth, the fire shall go out: and when the talebearer is taken away, contentions shall cease.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach to the innermost parts of the belly.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthen vessel adorned with silver dross.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> An enemy is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his lips, when in his heart he entertaineth <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">deceit</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him.</span><br />
