<h1>Psalm 101</h1>
<div class="h1a">A prayer for one in affliction: the fifth penitential psalm.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 102</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa100.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 101</strong>.</span></p>


<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when he was anxious, and poured out his supplication before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hear, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: and let my cry come to thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Turn not away thy face from me: in the day when I am in trouble, incline thy ear to me. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me speedily.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are grown dry like fuel for the fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered: because I forgot to eat my bread.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Through the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my flesh.</span><br />
