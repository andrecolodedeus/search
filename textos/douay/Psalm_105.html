<h1>Psalm 105</h1>
<div class="h1a">A confession of the manifold sins and ingratitudes of the Israelites.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 106</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa104.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 105</strong>.</span></p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> And they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> their sons, and their daughters to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> Many times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their counsel: and they were brought low by their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> And he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</span><br />
