<div class="h1a">David in the person of Christ, prays against his persecutors; more especially the traitor Judas: foretelling and approving his just punishment for his obstinacy in sin and final impenitence.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 109</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa107.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 108</strong>.</span></p>


<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Unto the end, a psalm for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be not thou silent in my praise: for the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and the mouth of the deceitful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is opened against me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; and have fought against me without cause.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Instead of making me a return of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, they detracted me: but I gave myself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they repaid me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Set thou the sinner over him: and may the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> stand at his right hand. <span class="stiki"><strong>Set thou the sinner over him, etc...</strong> Give to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that arch-sinner, power over him: let him enter into him, and possess him. The imprecations, contained in the thirty <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->verses<!--</a>--> of this psalm, are opposed to the thirty pieces of silver for which <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> betrayed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>; and are to be taken as <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetic</a> denunciations of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that should befall the traitor and his <a href="../cathen/01100a.htm">accomplices</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and not properly as <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curses</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be turned to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> May his days be few: and his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> let another take.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">fatherless</a> offspring.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> May his posterity be cut off; in one <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> may his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> be blotted out.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> May the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and let not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his mother be blotted out.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> May they be before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth:
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Because he remembered not to show mercy,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and the beggar; and the broken in heart, to put him to death.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursing</a>, and it shall come unto him: and he would not have <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, and it shall be far from him. And he put on <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursing</a>, like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a girdle with which he is girded continually.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> This is the work of them who detract me before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; and who speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> against my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, do with me for thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name's</a> sake: because thy mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am shaken off as locusts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> My knees are weakened through <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>: and my flesh is changed for oil. <span class="stiki"><strong>For oil...</strong> Propter oleum. The meaning is, my flesh is changed, being perfectly emaciated and dried up, as having lost all its oil or fatness.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked their heads.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Help me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; save me; according to thy mercy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is thy hand: and that thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, hast done it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> They will <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> and thou wilt <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a>: let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with their confusion as with a double cloak.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> I will give great thanks to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with my mouth: and in the midst of many I will praise him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from persecutors.</span></blockquote>
