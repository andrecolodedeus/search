<h1>Psalm 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">A just man's prayer in tribulation against the malice of his enemy.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 17</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa015.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 16</strong>.</span></p>


<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Hear, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: attend to my supplication. Give ear unto my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which proceedeth not from deceitful lips.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast tried me by fire: and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> hath not been found in me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> That my mouth may not speak the works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not moved.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> I have cried to thee, for thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hast heard me: O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Show forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust in thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> From them that resist thy right hand keep me, as the apple of thy eye. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proudly</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Their fat...</strong> That is, their bowels of compassion: for they have none for me.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Arise, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, disappoint him and supplant him; deliver my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">wicked one</a>; thy sword</span>
<span class="poe003"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> From the enemies of thy hand. O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores. They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance. <span class="stiki"><strong>Divide them from the few, etc...</strong> That is, cut them off from the earth, and the few trifling things thereof; which they are so <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of, or divide them from the few; that is, from thy <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, who are but few; that they may no longer have it in their power to oppress them. It is not meant by way of a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> or imprecation; but, as many other the like passages in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psalms</a>, by way of a prediction, or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of what should come upon them, in punishment of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Ibid. <strong>Thy hidden stores...</strong> Thy secret treasures, out of which thou furnishest those earthly goods, which, with a bountiful hand thou hast distributed both to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and the bad.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: I shall be satisfied when thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall appear.</span></blockquote>
