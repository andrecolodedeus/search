<h1>Psalm 17</h1>
<div class="h1a">David's thanks to God for his delivery from all his enemies.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 18</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa016.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 17</strong>.</span></p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Praising, I will call upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and I shall be saved from my enemies.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> In my affliction I called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and I cried to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: And he heard my voice from his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>: and my cry before him came into his ears.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The earth shook and trembled: the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> There went up a smoke in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: and a fire flamed from his face: coals were kindled by it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He bowed the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and came down, and darkness was under his feet.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he ascended upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and he flew; he flew upon the wings of the winds.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: dark waters in the clouds of the air.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> thundered from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and the Highest gave his voice: hail and coals of fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then the fountains of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were discovered: At thy rebuke, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, at the blast of the spirit of thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He sent from on high, and took me: and received me out of many waters.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me: for they were too strong for me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> They prevented me in the day of my affliction: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> became my protector.</span><br />
