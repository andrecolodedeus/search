<h1>Psalm 36</h1>
<div class="h1a">An exhortation to despise this world; and the short prosperity of the wicked; and to trust in Providence.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 37</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa035.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 36</strong>.</span></p>
