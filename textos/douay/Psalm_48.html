<h1>Psalm 48</h1>
<div class="h1a">The folly of worldlings, who live on in sin, without thinking of death or hell.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 49</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa047.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 48</strong>.</span></p>


<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Unto the end, a psalm for the sons of <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hear these things, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> All you that are earthborn, and you sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: both rich and poor together.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> My mouth shall speak wisdom: and the meditation of my heart understanding.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> I will incline my ear to a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>; I will open my proposition on the psaltery.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Why shall I fear in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day? the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of my heel shall encompass me. <span class="stiki"><strong>The iniquity of my heel...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of my steps or ways: or the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of my <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, with which as with the heel, I have spurned and kicked at my neighbours: or the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> of my heel, that is, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> in which I shall be found in death. The meaning of this verse is, Why should I now indulge those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> affections, or commit now those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall find me?</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> They that trust in their own strength, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the multitude of their riches, <span class="stiki"><strong>They that trust, etc...</strong> As much as to say, let them <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that trust in their strength or riches: for they have great reason to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: seeing no brother or other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, how much a friend soever, can by any price or labour rescue them from death.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> No brother can <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a>, nor shall <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a>: he shall not give to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his ransom,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Nor the price of the <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redemption</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and shall labour for ever, <span class="stiki"><strong>And shall labour for ever, etc...</strong> This seems to be a continuation of the foregoing sentence: as much as to say no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can by any price or ransom prolong his <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>. Others understand it of the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal sorrows</a>, and dying life of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And shall still live unto the end.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave their riches to strangers: <span class="stiki"><strong>He shall not see destruction, etc...</strong> Or, shall he not see destruction? As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must not expect to escape; when even the wise and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> are not exempt from dying.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their dwelling places to all <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generations</a>: they have called their lands by their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>They have called, etc...</strong> That is, they have left their <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> on their graves, which alone remain of their lands.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> This way of theirs is a stumbling block to them: and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth. <span class="stiki"><strong>They shall delight in their mouth...</strong> Notwithstanding the wretched way in which they walk, they shall applaud themselves with their mouths, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their doings.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> They are laid in hell like sheep: death shall feed upon them. And the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their help shall decay in hell from their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>In the morning...</strong> That is, in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> to a new life; when the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> shall judge and condemn the wicked. Ibid. <strong>From their glory...</strong> That is, when their short-lived <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this world shall be past, and be no more.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeem</a> my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Be not thou afraid, when a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall be made rich, and when the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his house shall be increased.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> descend with him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For in his lifetime his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>: and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> He shall go in to the generations of his fathers: and he shall never see light.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Man when he was in honour did not understand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.</span></blockquote>
