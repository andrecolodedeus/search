<div class="h1a">The temptation of the weak, upon seeing the prosperity of the wicked, is overcome by the consideration of the justice of God, who will quickly render to every one according to his works.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 73</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa071.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 72</strong>.</span></p>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Because I had a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> on occasion of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, seeing the prosperity of sinners.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> They are not in the labour of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: neither shall they be scourged like other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> hath held them fast: they are covered with their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> and their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have passed into the affection of the heart. <span class="stiki"><strong>Fatness...</strong> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Abundance and temporal prosperity<!--</a>-->, which hath encouraged them in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>: and made them give themselves up to their irregular affections.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> They have thought and spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: they have spoken <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> on high.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> They have set their mouth against <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and their tongue hath passed through the earth.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> of thy children. <span class="stiki"><strong>If I said, etc...</strong> That is, if I should indulge such thoughts as these.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I studied that I might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this thing, it is a labour in my sight:</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: they have perished by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> As the dream of them that awake, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And I am brought to nothing, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with thy <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> thou hast received me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For what have I in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>? and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my heart, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that is my portion for ever.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> But it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to adhere to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to put my <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>: That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion.</span></blockquote>
