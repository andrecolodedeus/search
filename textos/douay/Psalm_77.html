<h1>Psalm 77</h1>
<div class="h1a">God's great benefits to the people of Israel, notwithstanding their ingratitude.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used in most modern Bible translations, this psalm is called <strong>Psalm 78</strong>, and the <strong><a href="../douay/psa076.htm">previous psalm</a></strong> is known as <strong>Psalm 77</strong>.</span></p>

By this it appears that the historical facts of ancient times, commemorated in this psalm, were deep and mysterious: as being <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figures</a> of great truths appertaining to the time of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> How great things have we heard and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and our fathers have told us.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he set up a testimony in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>: and made a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> That another <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>. A <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> They kept not the covenant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and in his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> they would not walk.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shown them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the field of <a href="../cathen/14443b.htm">Tanis</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He struck the rock in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: and gave them to drink, as out of the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">great deep</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And they added yet more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against him: they provoked the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a> to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in the place without water.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And they <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they spoke ill of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: they said: Can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> furnish a table in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> heard, and was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: and a fire was kindled against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> came up against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and trusted not in his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And had rained down <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Man ate the bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: he sent them provisions in <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->abundance<!--</a>-->.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> He removed the south wind from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and by his power brought in the southwest wind.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> They were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> In all these things they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> still: and they behaved not for his wondrous works.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> And they remembered that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was their helper: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most high God</a> their <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemer</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> in his covenant.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> But he is merciful, and will forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: and did not kindle all his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> How often did they provoke him in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>: and move him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in the place without water?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> And they turned back and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and grieved the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse42">42</span> They remembered not his hand, in the day that he <a href="../cathen/12681a.htm">redeemed</a> them from the hand of him that afflicted them:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse43">43</span> How he wrought his signs in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and his wonders in the field of <a href="../cathen/14443b.htm">Tanis</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse44">44</span> And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might not drink.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse45">45</span> He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse46">46</span> And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse47">47</span> And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse48">48</span> And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse49">49</span> And he sent upon them the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of his indignation: indignation and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and trouble, which he sent by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil angels</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse50">50</span> He made a way for a path to his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: he spared not their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse51">51</span> And he killed all the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of all their labour in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->tabernacles<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/03566b.htm">Cham</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse52">52</span> And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a> like a flock.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse53">53</span> And he brought them out in <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> and they feared not: and the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse54">54</span> And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse55">55</span> And he made the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> to dwell in their <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->tabernacles<!--</a>-->.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse56">56</span> Yet they <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a>, and provoked the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most high God</a>: and they kept not his testimonies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse57">57</span> And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse58">58</span> They provoked him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on their hills: and moved him to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a> with their graven things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse59">59</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> heard, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> them, and he reduced <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> exceedingly as it were to nothing.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse60">60</span> And he put away the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> of Silo, his <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> where he dwelt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse61">61</span> And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse62">62</span> And he shut up his people under the sword: and he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despised</a> his inheritance.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse63">63</span> Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse64">64</span> Their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> fell by the sword: and their <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> did not mourn.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse65">65</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that hath been surfeited with wine.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse66">66</span> And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse67">67</span> And he rejected the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/08506a.htm">Joseph</a>: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse68">68</span> But he chose the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>, mount Sion which he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse69">69</span> And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever. <span class="stiki"><strong>As of unicorns...</strong> That is, firm and strong like the horn of the unicorn.
