<h1>Psalm 9</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Church praises God for his protection against her enemies.</div>
<p><span class="stiki">Does this psalm differ from what you were expecting? Don't be confused. There are two systems for arranging the psalms: the <strong>Septuagint</strong> and the <strong>Masoretic</strong>. We use the Septuagint system here. In the Masoretic system, which is used by many popular Bible translations, this psalm is split into two parts, called <strong>Psalm 9</strong> and <strong>Psalm 10</strong>.</span></p>
