<div class="h1a">The cry of a mighty angel. He gives John a book to eat.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I saw another mighty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head: and his face, as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he had in his hand a little book, open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> saying to me: Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken. And write them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the things which are therein, and the earth and the things which are in it, and the sea and the things which are therein: That time shall be no longer.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But in the days of the voice of the seventh <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, when he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be finished, as he hath declared by his servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Declared...</strong> literally evangelized, to signify the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">good tidings</a>, agreeable to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, of the final victory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, which should be the reward of the temporal sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I heard a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, again speaking to me and saying: Go and take the book that is open, from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I went to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, saying unto him that he should give me the book. And he said to me: Take the book and eat it up. And it shall make thy belly bitter: but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I took the book from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and ate it up: and it was in my mouth, sweet as honey. And when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said to me: Thou must <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> again to many nations and peoples and tongues and kings.</span></p>
