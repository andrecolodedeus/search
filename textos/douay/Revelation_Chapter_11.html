<h1>Revelation Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">He is ordered to measure the temple. The two witnesses.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And there was given me a reed, like unto a rod. And it was said to me: Arise, and measure the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> and them that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> therein.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a> which is without the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, cast out and measure it not: because it is given unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a> they shall tread under foot, two and forty months:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I will give unto my two <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>: and they shall <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a>, a thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>My two witnesses...</strong> It is commonly understood of <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Henoch</a> and <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand before the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will hurt them, fire shall come out of their mouths and shall devour their enemies. And if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will hurt them, in this manner must he be slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> These have power to shut <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, that it rain not in the days of their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a>: And they have power over waters, to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the abyss shall make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them and shall overcome them and kill them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which is called spiritually, <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: where their <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> also was crucified.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they of the tribes and peoples and tongues and nations shall see their bodies for three days and a half: and they shall not suffer their bodies to be laid in sepulchres.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry: and shall send gifts one to another, because these two <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And after three days and a half, the <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirit<!--</a>--> of life from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> entered into them. And they stood upon their feet: and great fear fell upon them that saw them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they heard a great voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying to them: Come up hither. And they went up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in a cloud: and their enemies saw them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And at that hour there was made a great earthquake: and the tenth part of the city fell. And there were slain in the earthquake, <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, seven thousand: and the rest were cast into a fear and gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> The second woe is past: and behold the third woe will come quickly.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the seventh <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sounded the trumpet: and there were great voices in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: The kingdom of this world is become <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">our Lord's</a> and his <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ's</a>, and he shall reign for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the four and twenty ancients who sit on their seats in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fell on their faces and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> We give thee thanks, O <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Almighty, who art and who wast and who art to come: because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and thou hast reigned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the nations were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>: and thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is come. And the time of the dead, that they should be judged and that thou shouldest render reward to thy servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and to them that fear thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, little and great: and shouldest destroy them who have corrupted the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of God</a> was opened in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">ark of his testament</a> was seen in his <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>. And there were lightnings and voices and an earthquake and great hail.</span></p>
