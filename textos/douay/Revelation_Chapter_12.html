<h1>Revelation Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">The vision of the woman clothed with the sun and of the great dragon her persecutor.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And a great sign appeared in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. <span class="stiki"><strong>A woman...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of God</a>. It may also, by allusion, be applied to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">our blessed Lady</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> is clothed with the sun, that is, with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: she hath the moon, that is, the changeable things of the world, under her feet: and the twelve stars with which she is crowned, are the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: she is in labour and pain, whilst she brings forth her children, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in them, in the midst of afflictions and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And being with child, she cried travailing in birth: and was in pain to be delivered.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And there was seen another sign in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. And behold a great red <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>-->, having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven diadems.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And his tail drew the third part of the stars of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and cast them to the earth. And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>--> stood before the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was ready to be delivered: that, when she should be delivered, he might devour her son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with an iron rod. And her son was taken up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to his throne.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> fled into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>, where she had a place prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that there they should feed her, a thousand two hundred sixty days.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And there was a great battle in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Michael</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fought with the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>-->, and the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>--> fought, and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they prevailed not: neither was their place found any more in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And that great <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>--> was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, who seduceth the whole world. And he was cast unto the earth: and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were thrown down with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I heard a loud voice in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: Now is come <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and strength and the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of our God</a> and the power of his <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>: because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth, who accused them before our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> day and night.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they overcame him by the blood of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> and by the word of the testimony: and they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> not their lives unto death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Therefore, rejoice, O <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a>, and you that dwell therein. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is come down unto you, having great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he hath but a short time.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>--> saw that he was cast unto the earth, he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who brought forth the man child.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And there were given to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, unto her place, where she is nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the serpent cast out of his mouth, after the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, water, as it were a river: that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the earth helped the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>--> cast out of his mouth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>--> was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: and went to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and have the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And he stood upon the sand of the sea.</span></p>
