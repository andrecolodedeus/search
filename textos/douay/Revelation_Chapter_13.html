<h1>Revelation Chapter 13</h1>
<div class="h1a">Of the beast with seven heads and of a second beast.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I saw a beast coming up out the sea, having seven heads and ten horns: and upon his horns, ten diadems: and upon his heads, names of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>A beast...</strong> This first beast with seven heads and ten horns, is probably the whole company of <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a>, enemies and persecutors of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the beginning to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>. The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires, which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">people of God</a>; of these, five were then fallen, viz.: the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a>, Chaldean, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, and Grecian monarchies: one was present, viz., the empire of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: and the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz., the great <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> and his empire. The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard: and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his own strength and great power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death: and his death's wound was healed. And all the earth was in admiration after the beast. <span class="stiki"><strong>One of his heads, etc...</strong> Some understand this of the mortal wound, which the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of the Roman empire (signified by the sixth head) received from <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine</a>; which was, as it were, healed again by <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the dragon which gave power to the beast. And they <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the beast, saying: Who is like to the beast? And who shall be able to fight with him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>: and power was given to him to do, two and forty months.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he opened his mouth unto <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> his <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name</a> and his <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle</a> and them that dwell in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>His tabernacle, etc...</strong> That is, his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And it was given unto him to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and to overcome them. And power was given him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And all that dwell upon the earth <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> are not written in the book of life of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> which was slain from the beginning of the world. <span class="stiki"><strong>Slain from the beginning, etc...</strong> In the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and inasmuch as all mercy and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, from the beginning, was given in view of his <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">death and passion</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have an ear, let him hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He that shall lead into captivity shall go into captivity: he that shall kill by the sword must be killed by the sword. Here is the patience and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth: and he had two horns, like a lamb: and he spoke as a dragon. <span class="stiki"><strong>Another beast...</strong> This second beast with two horns, may be understood of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and magicians; the principal promoters both of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight. And he caused the earth and them that dwell therein to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the first beast, whose wound to death was healed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he did great signs, so that he made also fire to come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> unto the earth, in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, for the signs which were given him to do in the sight of the beast: saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which had the wound by the sword and lived.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And it was given him to give life to the image of the beast: and that the image of the beast should speak: and should cause that whosoever will not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the image of the beast should be slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he shall make all, both little and great, rich and poor, freemen and bondmen, to have a character in their right hand or on their foreheads:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> might buy or sell, but he that hath the character, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the <a href="../cathen/11151a.htm">number</a> of the beast. For it is the <a href="../cathen/11151a.htm">number</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/11151a.htm">number</a> of him is six hundred sixty-six. <span class="stiki"><strong>Six hundred sixty-six...</strong> The numeral letters of his name shall make up this <a href="../cathen/11151a.htm">number</a>.</span></span></p>
