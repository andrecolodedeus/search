<h1>Revelation Chapter 14</h1>
<div class="h1a">Of the Lamb and of the virgins that follow him. Of the judgments that shall fall upon the wicked.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I beheld: and lo a <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> stood upon mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> written on their foreheads.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I heard a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as the noise of many waters and as the voice of great thunder. And the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne and before the four living creatures and the ancients: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand who were purchased from the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> These are they who were not defiled with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: for they are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. These follow the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And in their mouth there was found no lie: for they are without spot before the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I saw another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> flying through the midst of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, having the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, to preach unto them that sit upon the earth and over every nation and tribe and tongue and people:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Saying with a loud voice: Fear the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> and give him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, because the hour of his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> is come. And <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> ye him that made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> followed, saying: That great <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> is fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of her fornication. <span class="stiki"><strong>Babylon...</strong> By <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> may be very probably signified all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> world in general, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will punish, and destroy after the short time of this mortal life: or it may signify every great city wherein enormous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and abominations are daily committed; and that when the measure of its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> is full, the punishments due to its crimes are poured on it. It may also be some city of the description in the text, that will exist, and be destroyed, as here described, towards the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the third <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> followed them, saying with a loud voice: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the beast and his image and receive his character in his forehead or in his hand,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He also shall drink of the wine of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is mingled with pure wine in the cup of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the smoke of their torments, shall ascend up for ever and ever: neither have they rest day nor night, who have <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the beast and his image and whoever receiveth the character of his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Here is the patience of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who keep the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I heard a voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying to me: Write: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> are the dead who die in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. From henceforth now, saith the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that they may rest from their labours. For their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> follow them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Die in the Lord...</strong> It is understood of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who die for the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I saw: and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sitting like to the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, having on his head a crown of gold and in his hand a sharp sickle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came out from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, crying with a loud voice to him that sat upon the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle and reap, because the hour is come to reap. For the harvest of the earth is ripe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth: and the earth was reaped.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, he also having a sharp sickle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came out from the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, who had power over fire. And he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying: Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth, because the grapes thereof are ripe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth and gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great press of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the press, up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</span></p>
