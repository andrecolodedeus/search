<h1>Revelation Chapter 16</h1>
<div class="h1a">The seven vials are poured out. The plagues that ensue.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I heard a great voice out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, saying to the seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: Go and pour out the seven vials of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth. And there fell a sore and grievous wound upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who had the character of the beast: and upon them that <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the image thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And the second <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> poured out his vial upon the sea. And there came blood as it were of a dead <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and every living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> died in the sea.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the fountains of waters. And there was made blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And I heard the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the waters saying: Thou art <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, O <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, who art and who wast, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For they have shed the blood of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and thou hast given them blood to drink. For they are worthy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I heard another, from the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, saying: Yea, O <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Almighty, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> are thy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgments<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the fourth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> poured out his vial upon the sun. And it was given unto him to afflict <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with heat and fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were scorched with great heat: and they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hath power over these plagues. Neither did they <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> to give him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the fifth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast. And his kingdom became dark: and they gnawed their tongues for pain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, because of their pains and wounds: and did not <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for their works.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the sixth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> poured out his vial upon that great river Euphrates and dried up the water thereof, that a way might be prepared for the kings from the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>--> of the sun.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I saw from the mouth of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->dragon<!--</a>--> and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, three <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirits</a> like frogs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For they are the spirits of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, working signs: and they go forth unto the kings of the whole earth, to gather them to battle against the great day of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Behold, I come as a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>. <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he shall gather them together into a place which in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> is called <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Armagedon<!--</a>-->. <span class="stiki"><strong>Armagedon...</strong> That is, the hill of robbers.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the seventh <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> poured out his vial upon the air. And there came a great voice out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> from the throne, saying: It is done.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And there were lightnings and voices and thunders: and there was a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the great city was divided into three parts: and the cities of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> fell. And great <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> came in remembrance before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And every island fled away: and the mountains were not found.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And great hail, like a talent, came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the plague of the hail: because it was exceeding great.</span></p>
