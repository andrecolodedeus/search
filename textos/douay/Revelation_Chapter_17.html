<h1>Revelation Chapter 17</h1>
<div class="h1a">The description of the great harlot and of the beast upon which she sits.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And there came one of the seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who had the seven vials and spoke with me, saying: Come, I will show thee the condemnation of the great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication. And they who inhabit the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he took me away in spirit into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. And I saw a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, having seven heads and ten horns.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was clothed round about with purple and scarlet, and gilt with gold and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a> and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And on her forehead a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was written: A <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> the great, the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the earth. <span class="stiki"><strong>A mystery...</strong> That is, a secret; because what follows of the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and title of the great harlot is to be taken in a mystical sense. <strong>Babylon...</strong> Either the city of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in general; or, if this place be to be understood of any particular city, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which then and for three hundred years <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>; and was the principal seat both of empire and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I saw the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> drunk with the blood of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and with the blood of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. And I wondered, when I had seen her, with great admiration.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to me: Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> The beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall come up out of the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">bottomless pit</a> and go into destruction. And the inhabitants on the earth (whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was and is not. <span class="stiki"><strong>The beast which thou sawest...</strong> This beast which supports <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, may signify the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: which was and is not, being much limited by the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but shall again exert itself under <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. The seven heads of this beast are seven mountains or empires, instruments of his tyranny; of which five were then fallen. (See <a href="../douay/rev013.htm#verse1">13:1</a>, and <a href="../douay/rev017.htm#verse10">17:10</a>.) The beast itself is said to be the eighth, and is of the seven; because they all act under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and by his instigation, so that his power is in them all, yet so as to make up, as it were, an eighth empire, distinct from them all.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And here is the understanding that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> sitteth: and they are seven kings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come: and when he is come, he must remain a short time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the beast which was and is not: the same also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom: but shall receive power as kings, one hour after the beast. <span class="stiki"><strong>Ten kings...</strong> Ten lesser kingdoms, enemies also of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of Christ</a>: which, nevertheless, shall be made instruments of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the punishment of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. Some understand this of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Goths</a>, <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, Huns, and other barbarous nations, that destroyed the empire of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> These have one design: and their strength and power they shall deliver to the beast.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> These shall fight with the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> shall overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings: and they that are with him are called and <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he said to me: The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples and nations and tongues.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast: These shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and shall burn her with fire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth him: that they give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be fulfilled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which thou sawest is the great city which hath kingdom over the kings of the earth.</span></p>
