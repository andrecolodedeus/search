<div class="h1a">The fall of Babylon. Kings and merchants lament over her.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after these things, I saw another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> come down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, having great power: and the earth was enlightened with his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> the great is fallen, is fallen: and is become the habitation of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> and the hold of every <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a> and the hold of every <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateful</a> bird:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of her fornication: and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her; And the merchants of the earth have been made rich by the power of her delicacies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I heard another voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: Go out from her, my people; that you be not partakers of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and that you receive not of her plagues.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have reached unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> hath remembered her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Render to her as she also hath rendered to you: and double unto her double, according to her works. In the cup wherein she hath mingled, mingle ye double unto her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> As much as she hath <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> herself and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her. Because she saith in her heart: I sit a queen and am no <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>: and sorrow I shall not see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Therefore, shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine. And she shall be burnt with the fire: because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is strong, who shall <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived in delicacies with her, shall weep and bewail themselves over her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Standing afar off for fear of her torments, saying: Alas! alas! that great city, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, that mighty city: for in one hour is thy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her: for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall buy their merchandise any more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Merchandise of gold and silver and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>: and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet: and all thyine wood: and all manner of vessels of ivory: and all manner of vessels of <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stone</a> and of brass and of iron and of marble:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And cinnamon and odours and <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointment</a> and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots: and slaves and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the fruits of the desire of thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are departed from thee: and all fat and goodly things are perished from thee. And they shall find them no more at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> The merchants of these things, who were made rich, shall stand afar off from her, for fear of her torments, weeping and mourning,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And saying: Alas! alas! that great city, which was clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet and was gilt with gold and <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a> and pearls.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For in one hour are so great riches come to nought. And every shipmaster and all that sail into the lake, and mariners, and as many as work in the sea, stood afar off,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And cried, seeing the place of her burning, saying: What city is like to this great city?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they cast dust upon their heads and cried, weeping and mourning, saying: Alas! alas! that great city, wherein all were made rich, that had ships at sea, by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of her prices. For, in one hour she is made desolate.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Rejoice over her, thou <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and ye <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath judged your <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> on her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And a mighty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> took up a stone, as it were a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying: With such <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> as this, shall <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, that great city, be thrown down and shall be found no more at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And the voice of harpers and of musicians and of them that play on the pipe and on the trumpet shall no more be heard at all in thee: and no craftsman of any art whatsoever shall be found any more at all in thee: and the sound of the mill shall be heard no more at all in thee:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in thee: and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee. For thy merchants were the great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the earth: for all nations have been deceived by thy enchantments.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And in her was found the blood of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and of all that were slain upon the earth.</span></p>
