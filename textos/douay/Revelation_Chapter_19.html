<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things, I heard as it were the voice of much people in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>. Salvation and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power is to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And again they said: <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>. And her smoke ascendeth for ever and ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the four and twenty ancients and the four living creatures fell down and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that sitteth upon the throne, saying: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all ye his servants: and you that fear him, little and great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunders, saying: <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>: for the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Almighty, hath reigned.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Let us be glad and rejoice and give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to him. For the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">marriage of the Lamb</a> is come: and his wife hath prepared herself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And it is granted to her that she should clothe herself with fine linen, glittering and white. For the fine linen are the justifications of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to me: Write: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> are they that are called to the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">marriage supper of the Lamb</a>. And he saith to me: These words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I fell down before his feet, to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> him. And he saith to me: See thou do it not.

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I saw <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> opened: and behold a white horse.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And his eyes were as a flame of fire: and on his head were many diadems.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood. And his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is called: <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">THE WORD OF GOD</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the armies that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> followed him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he may strike the nations.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And he hath on his garment and on his thigh written: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->KING<!--</a>--> OF <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->KINGS<!--</a>--> AND <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->LORD<!--</a>--> OF LORDS.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And I saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> standing in the sun: and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that did fly through the midst of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>: Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> That you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of tribunes and the flesh of mighty <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them: and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen and of little and of great.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with him that sat upon the horse and with his army.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the beast was taken, and with him the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who wrought signs before him, wherewith he seduced them who received the character of the beast and who <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> his image.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth upon the horse, which proceedeth out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.</span></p>
