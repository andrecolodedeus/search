<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them that are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And thou hast tried them who say they are <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and are not: and hast found them <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">liars</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And thou hast patience and hast endured for my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and hast not fainted.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen: and do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> and do the first works. Or else I come to thee and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But this thou hast, that thou <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatest</a> the deeds of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaites</a>, which I also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>: To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of my God.</span></p>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will cast some of you into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, that you may be tried: and you shall have tribulation ten days.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>: He that shall overcome shall not be hurt by the second death.</span></p>

Even in those days when Antipas was my <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> witness, who was slain among you, where <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> dwelleth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But I have against thee a few things: because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, to eat and to commit fornication.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaites</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> In like manner do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>. If not, I will come to thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But I have against thee a few things: because thou sufferest the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a>, who calleth herself a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a>, to teach and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication and to eat of things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And I gave her a time that she might do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>: and she will not repent of her fornication.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Behold, I will cast her into a bed: and they that commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> from their deeds,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And I will kill her children with death: and all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts. And I will give to every one of you according to your works. But to you I say,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And to the rest who are at <a href="../cathen/14713c.htm">Thyatira</a>: Whosoever have not this doctrine and who have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the depths of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, as they say: I will not put upon you any other burthen.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Yet that which you have, hold fast till I come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And he that shall overcome and keep my words unto the end, I will give him power over the nations. <span class="stiki"><strong>Power over the nations...</strong> This shows, that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who are with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ our Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, receive power from him to preside over nations and provinces, as patrons; and shall come with him at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a> to execute his will against those who have not kept his commandments.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken:</span>
