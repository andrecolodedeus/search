<div class="h1a">The new Jerusalem described.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I saw a new <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and a new earth. For the first <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the first earth was gone: and the sea is now no more. <span class="stiki"><strong>The first heaven and the first earth was gone,</strong> being changed, not as to their <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->substance<!--</a>-->, but in their qualities.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I, <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, saw the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>, the new <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, coming down out of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And I heard a great voice from the throne, saying: Behold the <a href="../cathen/14424b.htm">tabernacle of God</a> with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and he will dwell with them. And they shall be his people: and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself with them shall be their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more. Nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more, for the former things are passed away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And he that sat on the throne, said: Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me: Write. For these words are most <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said to me: It is done. I am <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omega</a>: the Beginning and the End. To him that thirsteth, I will give of the fountain of the water of life, freely.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> He that shall overcome shall possess these things. And I will be his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and he shall be my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murderers</a> and whoremongers and sorcerers and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> and all <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">liars</a>, they shall have their portion in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">pool burning with fire and brimstone</a>, which is the second death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And there came one of the seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who had the vials full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying: Come and I will show thee the bride, the wife of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he took me up in spirit to a great and high mountain: and he showed me the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, coming down out of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it had a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and in the gates twelve <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> written thereon, which are the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">twelve tribes of the children of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> On the east, three gates: and on the north, three gates: and on the south, three gates: and on the west, three gates.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations: And in them, the twelve <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">names</a> of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he that spoke with me had a measure of a reed of gold, to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the city lieth in a four-square: and the length thereof is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the golden reed for twelve thousand furlongs: and the length and the height and the breadth thereof are equal.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And he measured the wall thereof an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The measure of a man, i.e., According to the measure of men, and used by the angel...</strong> This seems to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of these words.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And the building of the wall thereof was of jasper stone: but the city itself pure gold like to clear glass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stones</a>. The first foundation was jasper: the second, sapphire: the third; a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->chalcedony<!--</a>-->: the fourth, an emerald:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The fifth, sardonyx: the sixth, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->sardius<!--</a>-->: the seventh, chrysolite: the eighth, beryl: the ninth, a topaz: the tenth, a chrysoprasus: the eleventh, a jacinth: the twelfth, an amethyst.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, one to each: and every several gate was of one several pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as it were, transparent glass.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And I saw no <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> therein. For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God Almighty</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> thereof, and the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it. For the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath enlightened it: and the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> is the lamp thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And the nations shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth shall bring their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> into it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the gates thereof shall not be shut by day: for there shall be no night there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And they shall bring the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the nations into it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> There shall not enter into it any thing defiled or that worketh abomination or maketh a lie: but they that are written in the book of life of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>.</span></p>
