<h1>Revelation Chapter 22</h1>
<div class="h1a">The water and tree of life. The conclusion.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> In the midst of the street thereof, and on both sides of the river, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruits every month: the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And there shall be no <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> any more: but the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> shall be in it. And his servants shall serve him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they shall see his face: and his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> shall be on their foreheads.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And night shall be no more. And they shall not need the light of the lamp, nor the light of the sun, because the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall enlighten them. And they shall reign for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he said to me: These words are most <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of the spirits of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> sent his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to show his servant the things which must be done shortly.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And: Behold I come quickly. <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is he that keepeth the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of this book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I, <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, who have heard and seen these things. And, after I had heard and seen, I fell down to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> before the feet of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who showed me these things.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to me: See thou do it not. For I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and of them that keep the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of this book. <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">Adore</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he saith to me: Seal not the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of this book. For the time is at hand. <span class="stiki"><strong>For the time is at hand...</strong> That is, when compared to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, all time and temporal things vanish, and are but of short duration. As to the time when the chief predictions should come to pass, we have no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, as appears by the different opinions, both of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">ancient fathers</a> and late interpreters. Many think that most things set down from the <a href="../douay/rev004.htm">fourth chapter</a> to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>. Others are of opinion, that a great part of them, and particularly the fall of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, happened at the destruction of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, by the destruction of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Rome, and its <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> emperors. Of these interpretations, see Aleazar, in his long commentary; see the learned <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10098a.htm">Meaux</a>, in his treatise on this Book; and P. Alleman, in his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. 12, who in his Preface says, that this, in a great measure, may be now looked upon as the opinion followed by the learned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. In fine, others think that <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John's</a> design was in a mystical way, by metaphors and allegories, to represent the attempts and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> against the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the punishments that should in a short time fall upon <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, that is, upon all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in general: the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and reward, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had reserved for the pious inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, that is, for his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->faithful<!--</a>--> servants, after their short trials and the tribulations of this mortal life. In the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may easily enough understand: but we have no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> when we apply these predictions to particular events: for as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> takes notice, the Revelation has as many <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> as words, or rather <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> in every word. <em>Apocalypsis Joannis tot habet Sacramenta quot verba -- parum dixi, in verbis singulis multiplices latent intelligentiae.</em> [Ep. ad Paulin, t. 4. p. 574. Edit. Benedict.]</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He that hurteth, let him hurt still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, let him be justified still: and he that is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, let him be sanctified still. <span class="stiki"><strong>Let him hurt still...</strong> It is not an exhortation, or license to go on in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but an intimation, that how far soever the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> may proceed, their progress shall quickly end, and then they must expect to meet with proportionable punishments.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Behold, I come quickly: and my reward is with me, to render to every, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> according to his works.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> I am <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omega</a>, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> are they that wash their robes in the blood of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>: that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in by the gates into the city.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Without are dogs and sorcerers and unchaste and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murderers</a> and servers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and every one that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> and maketh a lie.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> I, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, have sent my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, to testify to you these things in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>. I am the root and stock of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09410a.htm">bright and morning star</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the spirit and the bride say: Come. And he that heareth, let him say: Come. And he that thirsteth, let him come. And he that will, let him take the water of life, freely.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a> of this book: If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall add to these things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall add unto him the plagues written in this book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall take away from the words of the book of this <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophecy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">holy city</a>, and from these things that are written in this book.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> He that giveth testimony of these things, saith: Surely, I come quickly: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Come, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> be with you all. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
