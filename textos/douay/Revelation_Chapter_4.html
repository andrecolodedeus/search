<h1>Revelation Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">The vision of the throne of God, the twenty-four ancients and the four living creatures.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After these things I looked, and behold a door was opened in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet speaking with me, said: Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must be done hereafter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And immediately I was in the spirit. And behold, there was a throne set in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and upon the throne one sitting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he that sat was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone. And there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments. And on their heads were crowns of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the four living creatures had each of them six wings: and round about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy, Holy, Holy, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when those living creatures gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and benediction to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that sitteth on the throne and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Thou art worthy, O <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and power. Because thou hast created all things: and for thy will they were and have been created.</span></p>
