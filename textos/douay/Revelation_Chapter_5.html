<div class="h1a">The book sealed with seven seals is opened by the Lamb, who thereupon receives adoration and praise from all.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I saw, in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book, written within and without, sealed with seven seals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I saw a strong <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, proclaiming with a loud voice: Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was able, neither in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> nor on earth nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I wept much, because no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was found worthy to open the book, nor to see it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not: behold the lion of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Juda</a>, the root of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the ancients, a <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> standing, as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sent forth into all the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours, which are the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The prayers of saints...</strong> Here we see that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> offer up to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> upon earth.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art worthy, O <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, to take the book and to open the seals thereof: because thou wast slain and hast <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeemed</a> us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And hast made us to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a kingdom and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and we shall reign on the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> round about the throne and the living creatures and the ancients (and the number of them was thousands of thousands),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Saying with a loud voice: The <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> that was slain is worthy to receive power and divinity and wisdom and strength and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and benediction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And every creature which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on the earth and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne and to the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>, benediction and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power, for ever and ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the four living creatures said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And the four and twenty ancients fell down on their faces and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> him that liveth for ever and ever.</span></p>
