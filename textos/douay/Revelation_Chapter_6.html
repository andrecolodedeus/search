<h1>Revelation Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">What followed upon opening six of the seals.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I saw that the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> had opened one of the seven seals: and I heard one of the four living creatures, as it were the voice of thunder, saying: Come and see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I saw: and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth conquering that he might conquer. <span class="stiki"><strong>White horse...</strong> He that sitteth on the white horse is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, going forth to subdue the world by his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>. The other horses that follow represent the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgments<!--</a>--> and punishment that were to fall on the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. The red horse signifies <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; the black horse, famine; and the pale horse (which has Death for its rider), plagues or pestilence.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying: Come and see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And there went out another horse that was red. And to him that sat thereon, it was given that he should take peace from the earth: and that they should kill one another. And a great sword was given to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying: Come and see. And behold a black horse. And he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I heard, as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying: Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and thrice two pounds of barley for a penny: and see thou hurt not the wine and the oil.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying: Come and see.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And behold a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Death. And <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> followed him. And power was given to him over the four parts of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine and with death and with the beasts of the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain for the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and for the testimony which they held. <span class="stiki"><strong>Under the altar...</strong> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is this <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, under which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> live in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">bodies</a> are here deposited under our <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they cried with a loud voice, saying: How long, O <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> (Holy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a>), dost thou not <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> and revenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? <span class="stiki"><strong>Revenge our blood...</strong> They ask not this out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to their enemies, but out of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a desire that the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> would accelerate the general <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->, and the complete <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->beatitude<!--</a>--> of all his <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And white robes were given to every one of them one; And it was said to them that they should rest for a little time till their fellow servants and their brethren, who are to be slain even as they, should be filled up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal: and behold there was a great earthquake. And the sun became black as <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">sackcloth of hair</a>: and the whole moon became as blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the stars from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> fell upon the earth, as the fig tree casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> departed as a book folded up. And every mountain, and the islands, were moved out of their places.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the kings of the earth and the princes and tribunes and the rich and the strong and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of mountains:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they say to the mountains and the rocks: Fall upon us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne and from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For the great day of their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is come. And who shall be able to stand?</span></p>
