<div class="h1a">The seventh seal is opened. The angels with the seven trumpets.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, as it were for half an hour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And I saw seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> standing in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and there were given to them seven trumpets.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came and stood before the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a>, having a golden <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a>: and there was given to him much <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, that he should offer of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, upon the golden <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> which is before the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the smoke of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ascended up before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> took the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> and filled it with the fire of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> and cast it on the earth: and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and a great earthquake.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And the seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the trumpet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the first <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sounded the trumpet: and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood: and it was cast on the earth. And the third part of the earth was burnt up: and the third part of the trees was burnt up: and all green grass was burnt up.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the second <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sounded the trumpet: and, as it were, a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the third part of those creatures died which had life in the sea: and the third part of the ships was destroyed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And the third <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sounded the trumpet: and a great star fell from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, burning as it were a torch. And it fell on the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the star is called <a href="../cathen/01060b.htm">Wormwood</a>. And the third part of the waters became <a href="../cathen/01060b.htm">wormwood</a>. And many <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the fourth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sounded the trumpet: and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened. And the day did not shine for a third part of it: and the night in like manner.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And I beheld: and heard the voice of one eagle flying through the midst of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, saying with a loud voice: Woe, Woe, Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of the rest of the voices of the three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are yet to sound the trumpet!</span></p>
