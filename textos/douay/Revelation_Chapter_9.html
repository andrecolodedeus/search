<h1>Revelation Chapter 9</h1>
<div class="h1a">Locusts come forth from the bottomless pit. The vision of the army of horsemen.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the fifth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sounded the trumpet: and I saw a star fall from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> upon the earth. And there was given to him the key of the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">bottomless pit</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>A star fall...</strong> This may mean the fall and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> of great and learned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Or a whole nation falling into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and separating from the church, not having the sign of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their foreheads. <strong>And there was given to him the key of the bottomless pit...</strong> That is, to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, not to the fallen star. To this <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was given the power, which is here signified by a key, of opening <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he opened the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">bottomless pit</a>: and the smoke of the pit arose, as the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the earth. And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. <span class="stiki"><strong>There came out locusts...</strong> These may be <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> in <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist's</a> time, having the appearance of locusts, but large and monstrous, as here described. Or they may be real locusts, but of an extraordinary size and monstrous shape, such as were never before seen on earth, sent to torment those who have not the sign (or seal) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on their foreheads. Some commentators by these locusts understand <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and especially those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that sprung from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and with them denied the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; as Theodotus, <a href="../cathen/12344a.htm">Praxeas</a>, Noetus, <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, Sabellius, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, etc. These were great enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>; they tormented and infected the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, stinging them like scorpions, with the poison of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Others have explained these locusts, and other animals, mentioned in different places throughout this sacred and mystical book, in a most absurd, fanciful, and ridiculous manner; they make <a href="../cathen/01005a.htm">Abaddon</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, and the locusts to be <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">friars mendicant</a>, etc. Here it is thought proper, not to enter into any controversy upon that subject, as the inventors of these fancies have been already answered, and fully refuted by many controvertists: besides, those who might be imposed on by such chimerical writers, are in these days much better informed.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree: but only the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who have not the sign of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on their foreheads.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And it was given unto them that they should not kill them: but that they should torment them five months. And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And in those days, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall seek death and shall not find it. And they shall desire to die: and death shall fly from them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle. And on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold: and their faces were as the faces of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they had hair as the hair of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: and their teeth were as lions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron: and the noise of their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to battle.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And they had tails like to scorpions: and there were stings in their tails. And their power was to hurt <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, five months. And they had over them</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> A king, the <a href="../cathen/01005a.htm">angel of the bottomless pit</a> (whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name in Hebrew</a> is <a href="../cathen/01005a.htm">Abaddon</a> and in Greek <a href="../cathen/01005a.htm">Apollyon</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/01005a.htm">Exterminans</a>).</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> One woe is past: and behold there come yet two woes more hereafter.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the sixth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sounded the trumpet: and I heard a voice from the <a href="../cathen/01354a.htm">four horns</a> of the golden <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> which is before the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Saying to the sixth <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who had the trumpet: Loose the four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are bound in the great river Euphrates.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year: for to kill the third part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times ten thousand. And I heard the number of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And thus I saw the horses in the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a>. And they that sat on them had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone. And the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions: and from their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And by these three plagues was slain the third part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For, their tails are like to serpents and have heads: and with them they hurt.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the rest of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who were not slain by these plagues, did not do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> from the works of their hands, that they should not <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which neither can see nor hear nor walk:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Neither did they <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> from their <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a> nor from their sorceries nor from their fornication nor from their thefts.</span></p>
