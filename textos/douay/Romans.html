<h1>Romans</h1>

<h2>The Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote this <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a> at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, when he was preparing to go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with the charitable contributions collected in <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a> and Macedonia for the relief of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>; which was about twenty-four years after <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Our Lord's Ascension</a>. It was written in Greek; but at the same time translated into <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, for the benefit of those who did not understand that language. And though it is not the first of his Epistles in the order of time, yet it is first placed on account of sublimity of the matter contained in it, of the preeminence of the place to which it was sent, and in veneration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. (<em>For more information, see the article</em> <a href="../cathen/13156a.htm">EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS</a> <em>in the Catholic Encyclopedia</em>.)

<p><a href="../douay/rom001.htm"><strong>Chapter 1.</strong></a> He commends the faith of the Romans, whom he longs to see. The philosophy of the heathens, being void of faith and humility, betrayed them into shameful sins.
<br><a href="../douay/rom002.htm"><strong>Chapter 2.</strong></a> The Jews are censured, who make their boast of the law and keep it not. He declares who are the true Jews.
<br><a href="../douay/rom003.htm"><strong>Chapter 3.</strong></a> The advantages of the Jews. All men are sinners and none can be justified by the works of the law, but only by the grace of Christ.
<br><a href="../douay/rom004.htm"><strong>Chapter 4.</strong></a> Abraham was not justified by works done, as of himself, but by grace and by faith. And that before he was circumcised. Gentiles, by faith, are his children.
<br><a href="../douay/rom005.htm"><strong>Chapter 5.</strong></a> The grounds we have for hope in Christ. Sin and death came by Adam, grace and life by Christ.
<br><a href="../douay/rom006.htm"><strong>Chapter 6.</strong></a> The Christian must die to sin and live to God.
<br><a href="../douay/rom007.htm"><strong>Chapter 7.</strong></a> We are released by Christ from the law and from the guilt of sin, though the inclination to it still tempts us.
<br><a href="../douay/rom008.htm"><strong>Chapter 8.</strong></a> There is no condemnation to them that, being justified by Christ, walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. Their strong hope and love of God.
<br><a href="../douay/rom009.htm"><strong>Chapter 9.</strong></a> The apostle's concern for the Jews. God's election is free and not confined to their nation.
<br><a href="../douay/rom010.htm"><strong>Chapter 10.</strong></a> The end of the law is faith in Christ, which the Jews refusing to submit to, cannot be justified.
<br><a href="../douay/rom011.htm"><strong>Chapter 11.</strong></a> God hath not cast off all Israel. The Gentiles must not be proud but stand in faith and fear.
<br><a href="../douay/rom012.htm"><strong>Chapter 12.</strong></a> Lessons of Christian virtues.
<br><a href="../douay/rom013.htm"><strong>Chapter 13.</strong></a> Lessons of obedience to superiors and mutual charity.
<br><a href="../douay/rom014.htm"><strong>Chapter 14.</strong></a> The strong must bear with the weak. Cautions against judging and giving scandal.
<br><a href="../douay/rom015.htm"><strong>Chapter 15.</strong></a> He exhorts them to be all of one mind and promises to come and see them.
<br><a href="../douay/rom016.htm"><strong>Chapter 16.</strong></a> He concludes with salutations, bidding them beware of all that should oppose the doctrine they had learned.
