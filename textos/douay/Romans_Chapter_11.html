<div class="h1a">God has not cast off all Israel. The Gentiles must not be proud but stand in faith and fear.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I say then: Hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cast away his people? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid! For I also am an <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a> of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">tribe of Benjamin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not what the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> saith of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a>, how he calleth on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, they have slain thy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, they have dug down thy <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altars</a>. And I am left alone: and they seek my life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But what saith the divine answer to him? I have left me seven thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that have not <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bowed their knees</a> to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Seven thousand, etc...</strong> This is very ill alleged by some, against the perpetual visibility of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of Christ</a>; the more, because however the number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> might be abridged by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> in the kingdom of the ten tribes, the church was at the same time in a most flourishing condition (under Asa and <a href="../cathen/08502c.htm">Josaphat</a>) in the kingdom of Judah.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Even so then, at this present time also, there is a remnant saved according to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">election</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And if by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is not now by works: otherwise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>It is not now by works, etc...</strong> If <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> were to come by works, done by nature, without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> would not be a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or favour, but a debt; but such dead works are indeed of no value in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. It is not the same with regard to works done with, and by, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for to such works as these, he has <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promised</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> What then? That which <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> sought, he hath not obtained: but the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">election</a> hath obtained it. And the rest have been blinded.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> As it is written: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given them the <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirit<!--</a>--> of insensibility; eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, until this present day. <span class="stiki"><strong>God hath given them, etc...</strong> Not by his working or acting in them; but by his permission, and by withdrawing his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in punishment of their obstinacy.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> saith: Let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and bow down their back always.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I say then: Have they so stumbled, that they should fall? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid! But by their offence <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is come to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that they may be emulous of them. <span class="stiki"><strong>That they should fall...</strong> The nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is not absolutely and without remedy cast off for ever; but in part only, (many thousands of them having been at first <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>), and for a time; which fall of theirs, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has been pleased to turn to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world and the diminution of them the riches of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: how much more the fulness of them?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For I say to you, <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: As long indeed as I am the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, I will <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> my <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh and may save some of them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For if the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruit</a> be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, so is the lump also: and if the root be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, so are the branches.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And if some of the branches be broken and thou, being a wild olive, art ingrafted in them and art made partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root: but the root thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou standest by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Be not highminded, but fear. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thou standest by faith: be not highminded, but fear...</strong> We see here that he who standeth by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may fall from it; and therefore must live in fear, and not in the vain <a href="../cathen/12403a.htm">presumption</a> and security of modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">sectaries</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps also he spare not thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> See then the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and the severity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: towards them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if thou abide in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. <span class="stiki"><strong>Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are here admonished not to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, nor to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: but to take occasion rather from their fall to fear and to be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, lest they be cast off. Not that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">whole</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church of Christ</a> can ever fall from him; having been secured by so many <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">divine promises</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">holy writ</a>; but that each one in particular may fall; and therefore all in general are to be admonished to beware of that, which may happen to any one in particular.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to graft them in again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For if thou were cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, wert grafted into the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> olive tree: how much more shall they that are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For I would not have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> (lest you should be wise in your own conceits) that blindness in part has happened in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, until the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should come in.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And so all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> should be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> As concerning the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">election</a>, they are most dear for the sake of the fathers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For the gifts and the calling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are without repentance. <span class="stiki"><strong>For the gifts and the calling of God are without...</strong> his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->repenting<!--</a>--> himself of them; for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">promises of God</a> are unchangeable, nor can he repent of conferring his gifts.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For as you also in times past did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> So these also now have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all. <span class="stiki"><strong>Concluded all in unbelief...</strong> He hath found all nations, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in unbelief and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; not by his causing, but by the abuse of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; so that their calling and <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">election</a> is purely owing to his mercy.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>! How incomprehensible are his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgments<!--</a>-->, and how unsearchable his ways!</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> For who hath <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>? Or who hath been his counsellor?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</span></p>
