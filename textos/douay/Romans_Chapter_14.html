<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now him that is weak in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs. <span class="stiki"><strong>Eat all things.</strong> Viz., without observing the distinction of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean and unclean</a> meats, prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>: which was now no longer <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. Some weak <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as we here gather from the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a>, made a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> by the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->; such as swine's flesh, etc., which the stronger sort of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> did eat without scruple. Now the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a>, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> or condemn the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter, to take care not to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> their weaker brethren, either by bringing them to eat what in their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> they think they should not, or by giving them such offence, as to endanger the driving them thereby from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Let not him that eateth <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> him that eateth. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath taken him to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Who art thou that judgest another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to make him stand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For one <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgeth<!--</a>--> between day and day: and another <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgeth<!--</a>--> every day. Let every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> abound in his own sense. <span class="stiki"><strong>Between day, etc...</strong> Still observing the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a> and festivals of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->. And he that eateth eateth to the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->: for he giveth thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he that eateth not, to the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> he eateth not and giveth thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For none of us liveth to himself: and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> dieth to himself.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For whether we live, we live unto the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->: or whether we die, we die unto the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->. Therefore, whether we live or whether we die, we are the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord's<!--</a>-->.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For to this end <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose again</a>: that he might be <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> both of the dead and of the living.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? Or thou, why dost thou <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For it is written: As I live, saith the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Therefore every one of us shall render account to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for himself.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Let us not therefore <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> one another any more. But <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>--> this rather, that you put not a stumbling block or a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> in your brother's way.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and am confident in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, that nothing is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>, to him it is <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Let not then our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is not meat and drink: but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For he that in this serveth <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> pleaseth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is approved of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Therefore, let us follow after the things that are of peace and keep the things that are of edification, one towards another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Destroy not the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who eateth with offence.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to eat flesh and not to drink wine: nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> or made weak.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Hast thou <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Have it to thyself before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For all that is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Discerneth...</strong> That is, distinguisheth between meats, and eateth against his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, what he deems <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a>. <strong>Of faith...</strong> By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is here understood <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: to act against which is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></span></p>
