<div class="h1a">He exhorts them to be all of one mind and promises to come and see them.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now, we that are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Let every one of you please his neighbour unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to edification.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not please himself: but, as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For what things soever were written were written for our learning: that, through patience and the comfort of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptures</a>, we might have <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind, one towards another, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> That with one mind and with one mouth you may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Wherefore, receive one another, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also hath received you, unto the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For I say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> was minister of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to confirm the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a> made unto the fathers: <span class="stiki"><strong>Minister of the circumcision...</strong> That is, executed his office and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the people of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and will sing to thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And again he saith: rejoice ye <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, with his people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And again: praise the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>-->, all ye <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and magnify him, all ye people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And again, <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a> saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in him the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> fill you with all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and peace in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>: that you may abound in <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> and in the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you that you also are full of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, replenished with all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that you are able to admonish one another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind, because of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is given me from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> That I should be the minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: sanctifying the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> may be made acceptable and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> I have therefore <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For I dare not to speak of any of those things which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> worketh not by me, for the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, by word and deed,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> By the virtue of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs and wonders</a>, in the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so that from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> round about, as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And I have so preached this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>, not where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was named, lest I should build upon another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a foundation.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For which cause also, I was hindered very much from coming to you and have been kept away till now.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But now, having no more place in these countries and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> When I shall begin to take my journey into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, I <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> that, as I pass, I shall see you and be brought on my way thither by you: if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But now I shall go to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to minister unto the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a> to make a contribution for the poor of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that are in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For it hath pleased them: and they are their debtors. For, if the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> When therefore I shall have accomplished this and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that when I come to you I shall come in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->abundance<!--</a>--> of the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> I beseech you therefore, brethren, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that you help me in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for me to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and that the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">oblation</a> of my service may be acceptable in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> That I may come to you with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and may be refreshed with you.</span>
