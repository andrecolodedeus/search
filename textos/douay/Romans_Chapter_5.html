<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> confoundeth not: because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> who is given to us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For why did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For scarce for a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will one die: yet perhaps for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> some one would dare to die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commendeth his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> towards us: because when as yet we were sinners according to the time.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for us. Much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> through him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the death of his <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</span>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Wherefore as by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death: and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>By one man...</strong> <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, from whom we all contracted original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For until the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was in the world: but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not imputed, when the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> was not. <span class="stiki"><strong>Not imputed...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, or made no account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was it imputed to them, in the manner it was afterwards, when they transgressed the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">written law of God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But death reigned from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, even over them also who have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, after the similitude of the transgression of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, who is a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">figure</a> of him who was to come.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died: much more the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the gift, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, hath abounded unto many.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And not as it was by one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation: but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is of many offences unto justification.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For if by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->abundance<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and of the gift and of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall reign in life through one, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation: so also by the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of one, unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to justification of life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For as by the disobedience of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, many were made sinners: so also by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of one, many shall be made <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> entered in that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might abound. And where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did more abound. <span class="stiki"><strong>That sin might abound...</strong> Not as if the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> were given on purpose for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to abound: but that it so happened through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> perversity, taking <a href="../cathen/11196a.htm">occasion</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> more, from the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> That as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> hath reigned to death: so also <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> might reign by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> unto life everlasting, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ our Lord</a>.</span></p>
