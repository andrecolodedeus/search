<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Know</a> you not, brethren (for I speak to them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->) that the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> hath dominion over a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as long as it liveth? <span class="stiki"><strong>As long as it liveth...</strong> or, as long as he liveth.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that hath an husband, whilst her husband liveth is bound to the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> of her husband: so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, by the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: that you may belong to another, who is <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again from the dead</a> that we may bring forth fruit to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For when we were in the flesh, the passions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which were by the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But now we are loosed from the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> of death wherein we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> What shall we say, then?

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I lived some time without the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->. But when the commandment came, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> revived,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me: and by it killed me.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For that which I work, I understand not.

But these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> motions, (though they are called the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they come from original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempt</a> and incline to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>), as long as the will does not consent to them, are not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because they are not voluntary.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it: but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwelleth in me.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For I am delighted with the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, according to the inward <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>:</span>
