<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who walk not according to the flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> of the <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirit<!--</a>--> of life, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, hath delivered me from the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of death.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For what the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sending his own Son in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh and of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, hath condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> That the justification of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For they that are according to the flesh mind the things that are of the flesh: but they that are according to the spirit mind the things that are of the spirit.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For the wisdom of the flesh is death: but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>: neither can it be.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And they who are in the flesh cannot please <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But you are not in the flesh, but the spirit, if so be that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwell in you. Now if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of Christ</a>, he is none of his.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but the spirit liveth, because of justification.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And if the Spirit of him that <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised up Jesus from the dead</a> dwell in you; he that <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised up Jesus Christ from the dead</a> shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For whosoever are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">sons of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For you have not received the <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirit<!--</a>--> of bondage again in fear: but you have received the <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirit<!--</a>--> of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm">Abba (Father)</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit that we are the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">sons of God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Spirit himself, etc...</strong> By the inward motions of divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the peace of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> experience, they have a kind of testimony of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> favour; by which they are much strengthened in their <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of their justification and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance: which is not usually granted in this mortal life: during which we are taught to work out our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with fear and trembling. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Phil<!--</a>-->. <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->2<!--</a>-->.12. And that he that thinketh himself to stand, must take heed lest he fall. <a href="../douay/1co010.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And if <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">sons</a>, heirs also; heirs indeed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and joint heirs with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with him.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For I reckon that the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->sufferings<!--</a>--> of this time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come that shall be revealed in us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">sons of God</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The expectation of the creature, etc...</strong> He speaks of the corporeal creation, made for the use and service of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and, by occasion of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, made subject to vanity, that is, to a perpetual instability, tending to corruption and other defects; so that by a figure of speech it is here said to groan and be in labour, and to long for its deliverance, which is then to come, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall reign no more; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall raise the bodies and unite them to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> never more to separate, and to be in everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For the creature was made subject to vanity: not willingly, but by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of him that made it subject, in <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">children of God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of the Spirit: even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">adoption of the sons of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of our body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For we are saved by <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> that is seen is not <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>. For what a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> seeth, why doth he <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> for?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> But if we <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought: but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings, <span class="stiki"><strong>Asketh for us...</strong> The Spirit is said to ask, and desire for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in us; inasmuch as he inspireth <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and teacheth us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And he that searcheth the hearts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knoweth</a> what the Spirit desireth: because he asketh for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> And we know that to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all things work together unto <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For whom he foreknew, he also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be made conformable to the image of his <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>: that he might be the Firstborn amongst many brethren. <span class="stiki"><strong>He also predestinated, etc...</strong> That is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">preordained</a> that all his <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> should be conformable to the image of his <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> And whom he <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> What shall we then say to these things? If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be for us, who is against us?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Who shall accuse against the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is he that justifieth:</span>
