As when, of two equally criminal, the king is pleased out of pure mercy to pardon one, whilst he <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->suffers<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to take place in the execution of the other.</span></span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will.

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> What if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, willing to show his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and to make his power <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, endured with much patience vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, fitted for destruction,</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For he shall finish his word and cut it short in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: because a short word shall the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Lord<!--</a>--> make upon the earth.</span>
