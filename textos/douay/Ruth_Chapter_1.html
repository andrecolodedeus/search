<h1>Ruth Chapter 1</h1>
<div class="h1a">Elimelech of Bethlehem going with his wife Naomi, and two sons, into the land of Moab, dies there. His sons marry wives of that country and die without issue. Naomi returns home with her daughter in law Ruth, who refuses to part with her.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> In the days of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a famine in the land. And a certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem Juda</a>, went to sojourn in the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> with his wife and his two sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He was <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Elimelech, and his wife Noemi: and his two sons, the one Mahalon, and the other Chelion, <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Ephrathites</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem Juda</a>. And entering into the country of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, they abode there.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died: and she remained with her sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And they took wives of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>, of which one was called Orpha, and the other Ruth. And they dwelt their ten years,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was left alone, having lost both her sons and her husband.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And she arose to go from the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> to her own country, with both her daughters in law: for she had heard that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> had looked upon his people, and had given them food.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with both her daughters in law: and being now in the way to return into the land of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> She said to them: Go ye home to your mothers, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> deal mercifully with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands whom you shall take. And she <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> them. And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And to say: We will go on with thee to thy people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But she answered them: Return, my daughters: why come ye with me? have I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Return again, my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent with age, and not fit for <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">wedlock</a>. Although I might conceive this night, and bear children,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> estate, you would be old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> before you <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marry</a>. Do not so, my daughters, I beseech you: for I am grieved the more for your distress, and the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> is gone out against me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again: Orpha <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> her mother in law, and returned: Ruth stuck close to her mother in law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people, and to her gods, go thou with her. <span class="stiki"><strong>To her gods, etc...</strong> Noemi did not mean to persuade Ruth to return to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">false gods</a> she had formerly <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">worshipped</a>: but by this manner of speech, insinuated to her, that if she would go with her, she must renounce her <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">false gods</a> and return to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> She answered: Be not against me, to desire that I should leave thee and depart: for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go: and where thou shalt dwell, I also will dwell. Thy people shall be my people, and thy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die: and there will I be buried. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> do so and so to me, and add more also, if aught but death part me and thee. <span class="stiki"><strong>The Lord do so and so, etc...</strong> A form of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swearing</a> usual in the history of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, by which the person wished such and such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to fall upon them, if they did not do what they said.</span></span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her friends:</span>
<p class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">l9</span> So they went together, and came to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. And when they were come into the city, the report was quickly spread among all: and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> said: This is that Noemi.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But she said to them: Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful), but call me Mara (that is, bitter), for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty</a> hath quite filled me with bitterness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I went out full and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath brought me back empty. Why then do you call me Noemi, whom the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty</a> hath afflicted?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So Noemi came with Ruth, the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabitess</a>, her daughter in law, from the land of her sojournment: and returned into <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, in the beginning of the barley harvest.</span></p>
