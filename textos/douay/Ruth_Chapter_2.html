<h1>Ruth Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Ruth gleans in the field of Boaz, who shows her favour.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and very rich, whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> was Booz.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Ruth, the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabitess</a>, said to her mother in law: If thou wilt, I will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with a householder, that will be favourable to me. And she answered her: Go, my daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> She went, therefore, and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And behold, he came out of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and said to the reapers: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> be with you. And they answered him: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers: Whose maid is this?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And he answered him: This is the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabitess</a>, who came with Noemi, from the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain, following the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink.</span>
<p class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> She fell on her face, and worshipping upon the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> before thy eyes, and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of another country?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and the land wherein thou wast born, and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> render unto thee for thy work, and mayst thou receive a full reward of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to whom thou art come, and under whose wings thou art fled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And she said: I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in thy eyes, my lord, who hast comforted me, and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not like to one of thy maids.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Booz said to her: At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate and was filled, and took the leavings.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before. And Booz commanded his servants, saying: If she would even reap with you, hinder her not:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them, that she may gather them without shame, and let no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> rebuke her when she gathereth them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out with a rod, and threshing what she had gleaned, she found about the measure of an ephi of barley, that is, three bushels:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Which she took up, and returned into the city, and showed it to her mother in law: moreover, she brought out, and gave her of the remains of her meat, wherewith she had been filled.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And her mother in law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned today, and where hast thou wrought? <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> be he that hath had pity on thee. And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she told the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, that he was called Booz.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And Noemi answered her: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be he of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: because the same kindness which he showed to the living, he hath kept also to the dead. And again she said: The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is our kinsman.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Ruth said: He also charged me, that I should keep close to his reapers, till all the corn should be reaped.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And her mother in law said to her: It is better for thee, my daughter, to go out to reap with his maids, lest in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> field some one may resist thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean with them, till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns.</span></p>
