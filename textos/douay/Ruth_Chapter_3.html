<h1>Ruth Chapter 3</h1>
<div class="h1a">Ruth instructed by her mother in law lies at Boaz's feet, claiming him for her husband by the law of affinity: she receives a good answer, and six measures of barley.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My daughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be well with thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our near kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the threshingfloor.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> see thee, till he shall have done eating and drinking.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell thee what thou must do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in law had bid her.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly, and uncovering his feet, laid herself down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And behold, when it was now midnight the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> was afraid, and troubled: and he saw a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> lying at his feet,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to her: Who art thou? And she answered: I am Ruth, thy handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near kinsman.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And he said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> art thou of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young men either poor or <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>Thy latter kindness, viz...</strong> to thy husband deceased in seeking to keep up his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marrying</a> his relation according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>, and not following after young men. For Booz, it seems, was then in years.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know that thou art a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another nearer than I.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, so the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> liveth: sleep till the morning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> could know one another, and Booz said: Beware lest any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> know that thou camest hither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it, and went into the city,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou done, daughter? And she told her all that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> had done to her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of barley: for he said: I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Noemi said: Wait, my daughter, till we see what end the thing will have. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said.</span></p>
