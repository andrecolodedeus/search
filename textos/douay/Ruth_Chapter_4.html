<h1>Ruth Chapter 4</h1>
<div class="h1a">Upon the refusal of the nearer kinsman, Boaz marries Ruth, who brings forth Obed, the grandfather of David.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Booz went up to the gate, and sat there. And when he had seen the kinsman going by, of whom he had spoken before, he said to him, calling him by his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: Turn aside for a little while, and sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Booz, taking ten <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the ancients of the city, said to them: Sit ye down here.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned from the country of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of kindred: buy it, and possess it: but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> hand, thou must take also Ruth, the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabitess</a>, who was the wife of the deceased: to raise up the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of thy kinsman in his inheritance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He answered: I yield up my <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of next akin: for I must not cut off the posterity of my own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Do thou make use of my <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a>, which I profess I do willingly forego.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now this in former times was the manner in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> between kinsmen, that if at any time one yielded his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to another: that the grant might be sure, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> put off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour; this was a testimony of cession of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And immediately he took it off from his foot.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he said to the ancients, and to all the people: You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and Chelion's, and Mahalon's, of the hand of Noemi:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And have <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">taken to wife</a> Ruth, the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabitess</a>, the wife of Mahalon, to raise up the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the deceased in his inheritance lest his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> be cut off, from among his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and his brethren and his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients, answered: We are witnesses: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> make this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who cometh into thy house, like <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>, and Lia, who built up the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>: that she may be an example of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Ephrata</a>, and may have a famous <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>: <span class="stiki"><strong>Ephrata...</strong> Another <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And that the house may be, as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore unto <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>, of the seed which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall give thee of this young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Booz therefore took Ruth, and <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> her: and went in unto her, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> gave her to conceive, and to bear a son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> said to Noemi: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who hath not suffered thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to want a successor: that his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> should be preserved in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Noemi taking the child, laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, her neighbours, congratulating with her, and saying, There is a son born to Noemi, called his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">David</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> These are the <a href="../cathen/06408a.htm">generations</a> of Phares: Phares begot Esron,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Esron begot Aram, Aram begot Aminadab,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Aminadab begot Nahasson, Nahasson begot Salmon,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Salmon begot Booz, Booz begot Obed,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Obed begot Isai, Isai begot <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">David</a>.</span></p>
