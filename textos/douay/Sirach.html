<h1>Sirach</h1>

<h2>The Book of Ecclesiasticus, also called Sirach</h2>

<p>This book is so called from a Greek word that signifies a preacher: because, like an excellent preacher, it gives admirable lessons of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. The author was Jesus the son of Sirach of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who flourished about two hundred years before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As it was written after the time of <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a>, it is not in the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">canon</a>; but is received as <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">canonical</a> and divine by the Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, instructed by <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">apostolical tradition</a>, and directed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a>. It was first written in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, but afterwards translated into Greek, by another Jesus, the grandson of the author, whose prologue to this book is the following:

<p><strong>The Prologue.</strong> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many and great things hath been shown us by the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and others that have followed them: for which things <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom, because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means become most learned. My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and other books, that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom; that such as are desirous to learn, and are made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> in these things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a>. I entreat you therefore to come with benevolence, and to read with attention, and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem, while we follow the image of wisdom, to come short in the composition of words; for the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> words have not the same force in them when translated into another tongue. And not only these, but the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> also itself, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time, I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible learning. Therefore I thought it <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book; and with much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.
