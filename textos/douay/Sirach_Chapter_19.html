<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Rehearse not again a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and harsh word, and thou shalt not fare the worse.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But the learning of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is not wisdom: and the device of sinners is not <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> There is a subtle <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and the same is detestable: and there is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is foolish, wanting in wisdom.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And there is one that uttereth an exact word telling the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And there is one that submitteth himself exceedingly with a great lowliness: and there is one that casteth down his countenance, and maketh as if he did not see that which is unknown:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And if he be hindered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> for want of power, if he shall find opportunity to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he will do it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his look, and a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when thou meetest him, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his countenance.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> The attire of the body, and the laughter of the teeth, and the gait of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, show what he is.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> There is a lying rebuke in the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of an injurious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>: and there is a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> that is not allowed to be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>: and there is one that holdeth his peace, he is wise.</span></blockquote>
