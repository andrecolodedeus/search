<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> So also a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool shall not resist against the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of fear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> As a fearful heart in the thought of a fool at all times will not fear, so neither shall he that continueth always in the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> He that pricketh the eye, bringeth out tears: and he that pricketh the heart, bringeth forth resentment.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> He that flingeth a stone at birds, shall drive them away: so he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Although thou hast drawn a sword at a friend, despair not: for there may be a returning. To a friend,</span>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty, that in his prosperity also thou mayst rejoice.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> As the vapour of a chimney, and the smoke of the fire goeth up before the fire: so also injurious words, and reproaches, and threats, before blood.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> I will not be ashamed to salute a friend, neither will I hide myself from his face: and if any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> happen to me by him, I will bear it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> But every one that shall hear it, will beware of him.</span></blockquote>
