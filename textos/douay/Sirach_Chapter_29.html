<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> He that showeth mercy, lendeth to his neighbour: and he that is stronger in hand, keepeth the commandments. <span class="stiki"><strong>And he that is stronger in hand...</strong> That is, he that is hearty and bountiful in lending to his neighbour in his necessity.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Lend to thy neighbour in the time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due time.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him: and thou shalt always find that which is necessary for thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found, and have given trouble to them that helped them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Till they receive, they <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the hands of the lender, and in promises they <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> their voice:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But when they should repay, they will ask time, and will return tedious and murmuring words, and will complain of the time:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And if he be able to pay, he will stand off, he will scarce pay one half, and will count it as if he had found it:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But if not, he will <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">defraud</a> him of his money, and he shall get him for an enemy without cause.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And he will pay him with reproaches and <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curses</a>, and instead of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> turn will repay him injuries.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Many have refused to lend, not out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but they were afraid to be defrauded without cause.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But yet towards the poor be thou more hearty, and delay not to show him mercy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Help the poor because of the commandment: and send him not away empty handed because of his poverty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend: and hide it not under a stone to be lost.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Place thy treasure in the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments of the most High</a>, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Shut up <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in the heart of the poor, and it shall obtain help for thee against all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Better than the shield of the mighty, and better than the spear:</span>
<span class="poe003"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> It shall fight for thee against thy enemy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is surety for his neighbour: and he that hath lost shame, will leave him to himself.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Forget not the kindness of thy surety: for he hath given his life for thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The sinner and the <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> fleeth from his surety.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> A sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety: and he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is surety for his neighbour: and when he hath lost all shame, he shall forsake him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Evil suretyship hath undone many of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> estate, and hath tossed them as a wave of the sea.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> It hath made powerful <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to go from place to place round about, and they have wandered in strange countries.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> A sinner that transgresseth the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, shall fall into an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suretyship: and he that undertaketh many things, shall fall into <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Recover thy neighbour according to thy power, and take heed to thyself that thou fall not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> The chief thing for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life is water and bread, and clothing, and a house to cover shame.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> Better is the poor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fare under a roof of boards, than sumptuous cheer abroad in another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> house.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Be contented with little instead of much, and thou shalt not hear the reproach of going abroad.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> It is a miserable life to go as a guest from house to house: for where a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is a stranger, he shall not deal confidently, nor open his mouth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> He shall entertain and feed, and give drink to the unthankful, and moreover he shall hear bitter words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Go, stranger, and furnish the table, and give others to eat what thou hast in thy hand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> Give place to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->presence<!--</a>--> of my friends: for I want my house, my brother being to be lodged with me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> These things are grievous to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of understanding: the upbraiding of houseroom, and the reproaching of the lender.</span></blockquote>
