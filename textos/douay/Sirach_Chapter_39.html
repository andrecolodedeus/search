<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> All the works of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> are exceeding <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> Even as he turned the waters into a dry land, and the earth was made dry: and his ways were made plain for their journey: so to sinners they are stumbling blocks in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a> things were <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> from the beginning, so for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> The principal things necessary for the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, are water, fire, and iron, <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, milk, and bread of flour, and honey, and the cluster of the grape, and oil, and clothing.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> All these things shall be for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, so to the sinners and the ungodly they shall be turned into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> There are spirits that are created for vengeance, and in their fury they lay on grievous torments.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> In the time of destruction they shall pour out their force: and they shall appease the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of him that made them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Fire, hail, famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> The teeth of beasts, and scorpions, and serpents, and the sword taking vengeance upon the ungodly unto destruction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> In his commandments they shall feast, and they shall be ready upon earth when need is, and when their time is come they shall not transgress his word.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse38">38</span> Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, and I have meditated, and thought on these things and left them in writing,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse39">39</span> All the works of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and he will furnish every work in due time.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse40">40</span> It is not to be said: This is worse than that: for all shall be well approved in their time.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse41">41</span> Now therefore with the whole heart and mouth praise ye him, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></blockquote>
