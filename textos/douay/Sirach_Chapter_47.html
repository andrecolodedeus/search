<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And as the fat taken away from the flesh, so was <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> chosen from among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He played with lions as with lambs: and with bears he did in like manner as with the lambs of the flock, in his youth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Did not he kill the giant, and take away reproach from his people?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> In lifting up his hand, with the stone in the sling he beat down the boasting of Goliath:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For he called upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> the Almighty, and he gave strength in his right hand, to take away the mighty warrior, and to set up the horn of his nation.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So in ten thousand did he <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> him, and praised him in the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, in <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> to him a crown of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and extirpated the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> the adversaries unto this day: he broke their horn for ever.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> In all his works he gave thanks to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one, and to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>, with words of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> With his whole heart he praised the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that made him: and he gave him power against his enemies:</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And to the festivals he added beauty, and set in order the solemn times even to the end of his life, that they should praise the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and magnify the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the morning.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> took away his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and exalted his horn for ever: and he gave him a covenant of the kingdom, and a throne of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span></blockquote>

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> That thou shouldst make the kingdom to be divided, and out of Ephraim a rebellious kingdom to rule.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Wherefore he gave a remnant to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> of the same stock.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had an end with his fathers.</span></blockquote>
