<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> By him also the height of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was founded, the double building and the high walls of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> In his days the <a href="../cathen/15581a.htm">wells</a> of water flowed out, and they were filled as the sea above measure.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> He took care of his nation, and delivered it from destruction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> He prevailed to enlarge the city, and obtained <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his conversation with the people: and enlarged the entrance of the house and the <a href="../cathen/04445a.htm">court</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> He shone in his days as the <a href="../cathen/09410a.htm">morning star</a> in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And as the rainbow giving light in bright clouds, and as the flower of roses in the days of the spring, and as the lilies that are on the brink of the water, and as the sweet smelling frankincense in the time of summer.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> As a bright fire, and frankincense burning in the fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> As a massy vessel of gold, adorned with every <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stone</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> As an olive tree budding forth, and a cypress tree rearing itself on high, when he put on the robe of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and was clothed with the perfection of power. <span class="stiki"><strong>Clothed with the perfection of power...</strong> That is, with all the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> denoting his dignity and authority.</span></span><br />

And about him was the ring of his brethren: and as the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a> planted in mount <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a>,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And as branches of palm trees, they stood round about him, and all the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> in their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> He stretched forth his hand to make a libation, and offered of the blood of the grape.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> He poured out at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/01360a.htm">altar</a> a divine odour to the most high <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Prince<!--</a>-->.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Then the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> shouted, they sounded with beaten trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Then all the people together made haste, and fell down to the earth upon their faces, to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God the most High</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the singers lifted up their voices, and in the great house the sound of sweet melody was increased.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the people in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> besought the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord the most High</a>, until the worship of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was perfected, and they had finished their office.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then coming down, he lifted up his hands over all the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with his lips, and to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And he repeated his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, willing to show the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> ye to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, who hath done great things in all the earth, who hath increased our days from our mother's womb, and hath done with us according to his mercy.</span><br />
