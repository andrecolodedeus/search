<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I will give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: for thou hast been a helper and protector to me.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the snare of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my helper.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, from them that did roar, prepared to devour.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of afflictions, which compassed me about:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me, and in the midst of the fire I was not burnt.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> tongue, and from lying words, from an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> king, and from a slanderous tongue:</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast delivered me from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> time.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> I directed my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to her, and in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> I found her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> I possessed my heart with her from the beginning: therefore I shall not be forsaken.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse32">32</span> Why are ye slow and what do you say of these things? your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are exceeding thirsty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse33">33</span> I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: buy her for yourselves without silver,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse34">34</span> And submit your neck to the yoke, and let your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receive discipline: for she is near at hand to be found.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little, and have found much rest to myself.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money, and possess abundance of gold by her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Let your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rejoice in his mercy and you shall not be confounded in his praise.</span><br />
