<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse35">35</span> Stand in the multitude of ancients that are wise, and join thyself from thy heart to their wisdom, that thou mayst hear every discourse of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the sayings of praise may not escape thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse36">36</span> And if thou see a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of understanding, go to him early in the morning, and let thy foot wear the steps of his doors.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse37">37</span> Let thy thoughts be upon the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and meditate continually on his commandments: and he will give thee a heart, and the desire of wisdom shall be given to thee.</span></blockquote>
