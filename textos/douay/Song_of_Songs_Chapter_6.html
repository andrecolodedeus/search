<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> I to my beloved, and my beloved to me, who feedeth among the lilies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Thou art beautiful, O my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, sweet and comely as <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> terrible as an army set in array.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have made me flee away. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from Galaad.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Thy cheeks are as the bark of a pomegranate, beside what is hidden within thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> There are threescore queens, and fourscore <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>, and young maidens without number.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> One is my <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a>, my perfect one is but one, she is the only one of her mother, the chosen of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and declared her most <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>: the queens and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>, and they praised her. <span class="stiki"><strong>One is my dove, etc...</strong> That is, my church is one, and she only is perfect and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Who is she that cometh forth as the morning <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>-->, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army set in array? <span class="stiki"><strong>Who is she, etc...</strong> Here is a beautiful metaphor describing the church from the beginning. As, the morning <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->rising<!--</a>-->, signifying the church before the written <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->; fair as the moon, showing her under the light of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>: and terrible as an army, the power of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's church</a> against its enemies.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valleys, and to look if the vineyard had flourished, and the pomegranates budded.</span><br />
