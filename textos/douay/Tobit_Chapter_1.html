<div class="h1a">Tobias' early piety: his works of mercy, particularly in burying the dead.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Tobias of the tribe and city of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a>, (which is in the upper parts of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> above Naasson, beyond the way that leadeth to the west, having on the right hand the city of Sephet),</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> When he was made captive in the days of Salmanasar king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, even in his captivity, forsook not the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But every day gave all he could get to his brethren his fellow captives, that were of his kindred.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And when he was younger than any of the <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">tribe of Nephtali</a>, yet did he no childish thing in his work.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Moreover when all went to the golden calves which <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had made, he alone fled the company of all,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And went to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>, and there <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> faithfully all his <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So that in the third year he gave all his <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a>, and strangers.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> These and such like things did he observe when but a boy according to the <a href="../cathen/14779c.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But when he was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">took to wife</a> <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> of his own tribe, and had a son by her, whom he called after his own <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And from his infancy he taught him to fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to abstain from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And when by the captivity he with his wife and his son and all his tribe was come to the city of Ninive,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> (When all ate of the meats of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>) he kept his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and never was defiled with their meats.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And because he was mindful of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> with all his heart, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave him favour in the sight of Salmanasar the king.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He therefore went to all that were in captivity, and gave them wholesome admonitions.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when he was come to Rages a city of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>, and had ten talents of silver of that with which he had been honoured by the king:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And when amongst a great multitude of his kindred, he saw Gabelus in want, who was one of his tribe, taking a note of his hand he gave him the aforesaid sum of money.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But after a long time, Salmanasar the king being dead, when Sennacherib his son, who reigned in his place, had a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Tobias daily went among all his kindred and comforted them, and distributed to every one as he was able, out of his goods:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> He fed the hungry, and gave clothes to the naked, and was careful to bury the dead, and they that were slain.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when king Sennacherib was come back, fleeing from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> by reason of the slaughter that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had made about him for his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> slew many of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, Tobias buried their bodies.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But when it was told the king, he commanded him to be slain, and took away all his substance.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But Tobias fleeing naked away with his son and with his wife, lay concealed, for many <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But after forty-five days, the king was killed by his own sons.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And Tobias returned to his house, and all his substance was restored to him.</span></p>
