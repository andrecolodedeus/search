<h1>Tobit Chapter 10</h1>
<div class="h1a">The parents lament the long absence of their son Tobias. He sets out to return.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But as Tobias made longer stay upon occasion of the marriage, Tobias his father was solicitous, saying: Why thinkest thou doth my son tarry, or why is he detained there?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Is Gabelus dead, thinkest thou, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> will pay him the money?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he began to be exceeding sad, both he and <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> his wife with him: and they began both to weep together, because their son did not return to them on the day appointed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But his mother wept and was quite disconsolate, and said: Woe, woe is me, my son; why did we send thee to go to a strange country, the light of our eyes, the staff of our old age, the comfort of our life, the hope of our posterity?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> We having all things together in thee alone, ought not to have let thee go from us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And Tobias said to her: Hold thy peace, and be not troubled, our son is safe: that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with whom we sent him is very trusty.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But she could by no means be comforted, but daily running out looked round about, and went into all the ways by which there seemed any hope he might return, that she might if possible see him coming afar off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But Raguel said to his son in law: Stay here, and I will send a messenger to Tobias thy father, that thou art in health.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Tobias said to him: I know that my father and mother now count the days, and their spirit is grievously afflicted within them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And when Raguel had pressed Tobias with many words, and he by no means would hearken to him, he delivered Sara unto him, and half of all his substance in menservants, and womenservants, in cattle, in camels, and in kine, and in much money, and sent him away safe and joyful from him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Saying: The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> be with you in your journey, and bring you through safe, and that you may find all things well about your parents, and my eyes may see your children before I die.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And the parents taking their daughter <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> her, and let her go:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Admonishing her to honour her father and mother in law, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her husband, to take care of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to govern the house, and to behave herself irreprehensibly.</span></p>
