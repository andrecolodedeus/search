<h1>Tobit Chapter 11</h1>
<div class="h1a">Tobias anoints his father's eyes with the fish's gall, and he recovers his sight.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And as they were returning they came to Charan, which is in the midway to Ninive, the eleventh day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said: Brother Tobias, thou knowest how thou didst leave thy father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> If it please thee therefore, let us go before, and let the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> follow softly after us, together with thy wife, and with the beasts.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And as this their going pleased him, Raphael said to Tobias: Take with thee of the gall of the fish, for it will be necessary. So Tobias took some of that gall and departed.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> sat beside the way daily, on the top of a hill, from whence she might see afar off.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And while she watched his coming from that place, she saw him afar off, and presently perceived it was her son coming: and returning she told her husband, saying: Behold thy son cometh.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Raphael said to Tobias: As soon as thou shalt come into thy house, forthwith <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>: and giving thanks to him, go to thy father, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And immediately anoint his eyes with this gall of the fish, which thou carriest with thee. For be assured that his eyes shall be presently opened, and thy father shall see the light of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and shall rejoice in the sight of thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Then the dog, which had been with them in the way, ran before, and coming as if he had brought the news, showed his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by his fawning and wagging his tail. <span class="stiki"><strong>The dog, etc...</strong> This may seem a very minute circumstance to be recorded in sacred history: but as we learn from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, <a href="../douay/mat005.htm#verse18">Matthew 5:18</a>, there are iotas and tittles in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: that is to say, things that appear minute, but which have indeed a deep and mysterious meaning in them.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And his father that was blind, rising up, began to run stumbling with his feet: and giving a servant his hand, went to meet his son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And receiving him <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him, as did also his wife, and they began to weep for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And when they had <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and given him thanks, they sat down together.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then Tobias taking of the gall of the fish, anointed his father's eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And he stayed about half an hour: and a white skin began to come out of his eyes, like the skin of an egg.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And Tobias took hold of it, and drew it from his eyes, and recovered his sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both he and his wife and all that knew him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Tobias said: I <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because thou hast chastised me, and thou hast saved me and behold I see Tobias my son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And after seven days Sara his son's wife and all the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> arrived safe, and the cattle, and the camels, and an abundance of money of his wife's: and that money also which he had received of Gabelus,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And he told his parents all the benefits of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he had done to him by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that conducted him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And <a href="../cathen/01102b.htm">Achior</a> and Nabath the kinsmen of Tobias came, rejoicing for Tobias, and congratulating with him for all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had done for him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And for seven days they feasted and rejoiced all with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span></p>
