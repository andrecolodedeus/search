<h1>Tobit Chapter 12</h1>
<div class="h1a">Raphael makes himself known.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Tobias called to him his son and said to him: What can we give to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is come with thee?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Tobias answering, said to his father: Father, what wages shall we give him? or what can be worthy of his benefits?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> He conducted me and brought me safe again, he received the money of Gabelus, he caused me to have my wife, and he chased from her the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a>, he gave <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to her parents, myself he delivered from being devoured by the fish, thee also he hath made to see the light of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and we are filled with all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things through him. What can we give him sufficient for these things?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to accept of one half of all things that have been brought.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> So the father and the son calling him, took him aside: and began to desire him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had brought,</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Then he said to them secretly, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Bless</a> ye the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to him in the sight of all that live, because he hath shown his mercy to you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to hide the secret of a king: to reveal and confess the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> more than to lay up treasures of gold.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But they that commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a>, are enemies to their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> I discover then the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> unto you, and I will not hide the secret from you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> When thou didst <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And because thou wast acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it was necessary that temptation should prove thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath sent me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara thy son's wife from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For I am the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And when they had heard these things, they were troubled, and being seized with fear they fell upon the ground on their face.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to them: Peace be to you, fear not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For when I was with you, I was there by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> ye him, and sing praises to him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> I seemed indeed to eat and to drink with you but I use an invisible meat and drink, which cannot be seen by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> It is time therefore that I return to him that sent me: but <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> ye <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and publish all his wonderful works.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when he had said these things, he was taken from their sight, and they could see him no more.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and rising up, they told all his wonderful works.</span></p>
