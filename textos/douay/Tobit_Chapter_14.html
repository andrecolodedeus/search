<h1>Tobit Chapter 14</h1>
<div class="h1a">Old Tobias dies at the age of 102 years, after exhorting his son and grandsons to piety, foreshowing that Niniveh shall be destroyed, and Jerusalem rebuilt. The younger Tobias returns with his family to Raguel, and dies happily as he had lived.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And the words of Tobias were ended. And after Tobias was restored to his sight, he lived two and forty years, and saw the children of his grandchildren.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And after he had lived a hundred and two years, he was buried honorably in Ninive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For he was six and fifty years old when he lost the sight of his eyes, and sixty when he recovered it again.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the rest of his life was in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and with great increase of the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he departed in peace.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And at the hour of his death he called unto him his son Tobias and his children, seven young men, his grandsons, and said to them:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> The destruction of Ninive is at hand: for the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> must be fulfilled: and our brethren, that are scattered abroad from the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, shall return to it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And all the land thereof that is <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> shall be filled with people, and the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a> which is burnt in it, shall again be rebuilt: and all that fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall return thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall leave their idols, and shall come into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and shall dwell in it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And all the kings of the earth shall rejoice in it, adoring the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">King of Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Hearken therefore, my children, to your father: serve the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and seek to do the things that please him:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And command your children that they do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, and that they be mindful of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> him at all times in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and with all their power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And now, children, hear me, and do not stay here: but as soon as you shall bury your mother by me in one sepulchre, without delay direct your steps to depart hence:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For I see that its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> will bring it to destruction.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And it came to pass that after the death of his mother, Tobias departed out of Ninive with his wife, and children, and children's children, and returned to his father and mother in law.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And he found them in health in a good old age: and he took care of them, and he closed their eyes: and all the inheritance of Raguel's house came to him: and he saw his children's children to the fifth <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And after he had lived ninety-nine years in the fear of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> they buried him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And all his kindred, and all his <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> continued in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> life, and in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> conversation, so that they were acceptable both to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to all that dwelt in the land.</span></p>
