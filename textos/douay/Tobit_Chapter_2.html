<h1>Tobit Chapter 2</h1>
<div class="h1a">Tobias leaves his dinner to bury the dead: he loses his sight by God's permission, for manifestation of his patience.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But after this, when there was a festival of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> dinner was prepared in Tobias' house,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> He said to his son: Go, and bring some of our tribe that fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to feast with us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when he had gone, returning he told him, that one of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> lay slain in the street. And he forthwith leaped up from his place at the table, and left his dinner, and came <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to the body.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And taking it up carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Remembering the word which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke by Amos the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: Your festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So when the sun was down, he went and buried him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying: once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But Tobias fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Now it happened one day that being wearied with burying, he came to his house, and cast himself down by the wall and slept,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And as he was sleeping, hot dung out of a swallow's nest fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Now this trial the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> therefore permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For whereas he had always feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from his infancy, and kept his commandments, he repined not against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of blindness had befallen him,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> But continued immoveable in the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all the days of his life.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For as the kings insulted over <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job: so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying: <span class="stiki"><strong>Kings...</strong> So Job's three friends are here called, because they were princes in their respective territories.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and buriedst the dead?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speak not so:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For we are the children of saints, and look for that life which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will give to those that never change their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Now <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> his wife went daily to weaving work, and she brought home what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Whereby it came to pass, that she received a young kid, and brought it home:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And when her husband heard it bleating, he said: Take heed, lest perhaps it be stolen: restore ye it to its owners, for it is not lawful for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> At these words his wife being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> answered: It is evident the hope is come to nothing, and thy <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> now appear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And with these and other, such like words she upbraided him.</span></p>
