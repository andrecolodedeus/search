<div class="h1a">The prayer of Tobias, and of Sarah, in their several afflictions, are heard by God, and the angel Raphael is sent to relieve them.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Tobias sighed, and began to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with tears,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Saying,</p>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"> Thou art <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and all thy judgments are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and all thy ways mercy, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and judgment:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And now, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, think of me, and take not revenge of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, neither remember my offences, nor those of my parents.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For we have not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> thy commandments, therefore are we delivered to spoil and to captivity, and death, and are made a fable, and a reproach to all nations, amongst which thou hast scattered us.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And now, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, great are thy judgments, because we have not done according to thy precepts, and have not walked sincerely before thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And now, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, do with me according to thy will, and command my spirit to be received in peace: for it is better for me to die, than to live.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Now it happened on the same day, that Sara daughter of Raguel, in Rages a city of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>, received a reproach from one of her father's servant maids, <span class="stiki"><strong>Rages...</strong> In the Greek it is <em>Ecbatana</em>, which was also called <em>Rages</em>. For there were two cities in <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of <em>Rages</em>. Raguel dwelt in one of them, and Gabelus in the other.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Because she had been given to seven husbands and a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> <a href="../cathen/01792c.htm">Asmodeus</a> had killed them, at their first going in unto her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> So when she reproved the maid for her fault, she answered her, saying: May we never see son, or daughter of thee upon the earth, thou murderer of thy husbands.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Wilt thou kill me also, as thou hast already killed seven husbands? At these words, she went into an upper chamber of her house: and for three days and three nights did neither eat nor drink:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But continuing in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with tears besought <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he would deliver her from this reproach.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And it came to pass on the third day when she was making an end of her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> She said: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> is thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, who when thou hast been <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, wilt show mercy, and in the time of tribulation forgivest the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of them that call upon thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> To thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, I turn my face, to thee I direct my eyes.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> I beg, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach, or else take me away from the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Thou knowest, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that I never <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> a husband, and have kept my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> clean from all <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Never have I joined myself with them that play: neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But a husband I consented to take, with thy fear, not with my <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And either I was unworthy of them, or they perhaps were not worthy of me: because perhaps thou hast kept me for another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For thy counsel is not in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> But this every one is sure of that worshippeth thee, that his life, if it be under trial, shall be crowned and if it be under tribulation, it shall be delivered: and if it be under correction, it shall be allowed to come to thy mercy.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For thou art not delighted in our being lost, because after a storm thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou pourest in joyfulness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Be thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> for ever,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> At that time the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of them both were heard in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a>, Raphael was sent to heal them both, whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span></p>
