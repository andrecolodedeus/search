<div class="h1a">Tobias thinking he shall die, gives his son godly admonitions: and tells him of money he had lent to a friend.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Therefore when Tobias thought that his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was heard that he might die, he called to him Tobias his son,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And said to him: Hear, my son, the words of my mouth, and lay them as a foundation in thy heart.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall take my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, thou shalt bury my body: and thou shalt honour thy mother all the days of her life:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For thou must be mindful what and how great perils she suffered for thee in her womb.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And when she also shall have ended the time of her life, bury her by me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And all the days of thy life have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in thy mind: and take heed thou never consent to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor transgress the commandments of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> out of thy substance, and turn not away thy face from any poor person: for so it shall come to pass that the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall not be turned from thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> According to thy ability be merciful.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> If thou have much give abundantly: if thou have little, take care even so to bestow willingly a little.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For thus thou storest up to thyself a <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">good reward</a> for the day of necessity.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> deliver from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and from death, and will not suffer the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to go into darkness.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Alms shall be a great confidence before the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to all them that give it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Take heed to keep thyself, my son, from all fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know a crime.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Never suffer <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to reign in thy mind, or in thy words: for from it all perdition took its beginning.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath done any work for thee, immediately pay him his hire, and let not the wages of thy hired servant stay with thee at all.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> See thou never do to another what thou wouldst <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> to have done to thee by another.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Eat thy bread with the hungry and the needy, and with thy garments cover the naked,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Lay out thy bread, and thy wine upon the burial of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and do not eat and drink thereof with the wicked.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Seek counsel always of a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Bless</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at all times: and desire of him to direct thy ways, and that all thy counsels may abide in him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> I tell thee also, my son, that I lent ten talents of silver, while thou wast yet a child, to Gabelus, in Rages a city of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>, and I have a note of his hand with me:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Now therefore inquire how thou mayst go to him, and receive of him the foresaid sum of money, and restore to him the note of his hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Fear not, my son: we lead indeed a poor life, but we shall have many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things if we fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and depart from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</span></p>
