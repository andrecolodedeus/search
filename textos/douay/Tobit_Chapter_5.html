<h1>Tobit Chapter 5</h1>
<div class="h1a">Young Tobias seeking a guide for his journey, the angel Raphael, in shape of a man, undertakes this office.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then Tobias answered his father, and said: I will do all things, father, which thou hast commanded me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell; he knoweth not me, and I know not him: what token shall I give him? nor did I ever know the way which leadeth thither.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then his father answered him, and said: I have a note of his hand with me, which when thou shalt show him, he will presently pay it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But go now, and seek thee out some <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faithful</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to go with thee for his hire: that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And not knowing that he was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>, he saluted him, and said: From whence art thou, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> young man?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But he answered: Of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>. And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he answered: I know it: and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who dwelleth at Rages a city of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And Tobias said to him: Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father. Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> So going in he saluted him, and said: Joy be to thee always.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And Tobias said: What manner of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> shall be to me, who sit in darkness and see not the light of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the young man said to him: Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, thy cure from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is at hand.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And Tobias said to him: Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus at Rages, a city of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>? and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him: I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And Tobias said to him: I pray thee, tell me, of what <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, or what tribe art thou?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And Raphael the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answered: Dost thou seek the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias. <span class="stiki"><strong>Azarias...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> took the form of Azarias: and therefore might call himself by the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whom he personated. Azarias, in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, signifies the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Ananias the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. But I pray thee be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> that I desired to know thy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And Tobias answering, said: May you have a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> journey, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be with you in your way, and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> accompany you.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For our poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a> doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace.</span></p>
