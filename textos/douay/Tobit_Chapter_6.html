<h1>Tobit Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">By the angel's advice young Tobias takes hold on a fish that assaults him. Reserves the heart, the gall, and the liver for medicines. They lodge at the house of Raguel, whose daughter Sarah, Tobias is to marry; she had before been married to seven husbands, who were all slain by a devil.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And Tobias went forward, and the dog followed him, and he lodged the first night by the river of Tigris.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he went out to <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">wash his feet</a>, and behold a monstrous fish came up to devour him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And Tobias being afraid of him, cried out with a loud voice, saying: Sir, he cometh upon me.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him: Take him by the gill, and draw him to thee. And when he had done so, he drew him out upon the land, and he began to pant before his feet.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him: Take out the entrails of this fish, and lay up his heart, and his gall, and his liver for thee: for these are necessary for useful medicines.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when he had done so, he roasted the flesh thereof, and they took it with them in the way: the rest they salted as much as might serve them, till they came to Rages the city of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Then Tobias asked the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and said to him: I beseech thee, brother Azarias, tell me what remedies are these things good for, which thou hast bid me keep of the fish?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, answering, said to him: If thou put a little piece of its heart upon coals, the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, either from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> or from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, so that they come no more to them. <span class="stiki"><strong>Its heart, etc. The liver (verse 19)...</strong> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was pleased to give these things a virtue against those <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirits</a>, to make them, who affected to be like the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Most High</a>, subject to such mean corporeal creatures as instruments of his power.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the gall is good for anointing the eyes, in which there is a white speck, and they shall be cured.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And Tobias said to him: Where wilt thou that we lodge?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answering, said: Here is one whose <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> is Raguel, a near kinsman of thy tribe, and he hath a daughter <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">named</a> Sara, but he hath no son nor any other daughter beside her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> All his substance is due to thee, and thou must take her to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Ask her therefore of her father, and he will give her thee to wife.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Then Tobias answered, and said: I hear that she hath been given to seven husbands, and they all died: moreover I have heard, that a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> killed them.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Now I am afraid, lest the same thing should happen to me also: and whereas I am the only child of my parents, I should bring down their old age with sorrow to hell. <span class="stiki"><strong>Hell...</strong> That is, to the place where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">good</a> were kept before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Raphael said to him: Hear me, and I will show thee who they are, over whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can prevail.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For they who in such manner receive matrimony, as to shut out <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from themselves, and from their mind, and to give themselves to their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, as the horse and mule, which have not understanding, over them the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> hath power.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But thou when thou shalt take her, go into the chamber, and for three days keep thyself continent from her, and give thyself to nothing else but to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And on that night lay the liver of the fish on the fire, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> shall be driven away.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But the second night thou shalt be admitted into the society of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarchs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And the third night thou shalt obtain a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> that sound children may be born of you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And when the third night is past, thou shalt take the virgin with the fear of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, moved rather for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of children than for <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, that in the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thou mayst obtain a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> in children.</span></p>
