<h1>Tobit Chapter 7</h1>
<div class="h1a">They are kindly entertained by Raguel. Tobias demands Sarah to wife.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And they went in to Raguel, and Raguel received them with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Raguel looking upon Tobias, said to <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> his wife: How like is this young man to my cousin?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And when he had spoken these words, he said: Whence are ye young men our brethren?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> But they said: We are of the <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">tribe of Nephtali</a>, of the captivity of Ninive.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And Raguel said to them: Do you know Tobias my brother? And they said: We know him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when he was speaking many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of him, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to Raguel: Tobias concerning whom thou inquirest is this young <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> father.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Raguel went to him, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> him with tears and weeping upon his neck, said: A <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> be upon thee, my son, because thou art the son of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and most virtuous <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> his wife, and Sara their daughter wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And after they had spoken, Raguel commanded a sheep to be killed, and a feast to be prepared. And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Tobias said: I will not eat nor drink here this day, unless thou first grant me my petition, and promise to give me Sara thy daughter.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now when Raguel heard this he was afraid, knowing what had happened to those seven husbands, that went in unto her: and he began to fear lest it might happen to him also in like manner: and as he was in suspense, and gave no answer to his petition,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him: Be not afraid to give her to this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for to him who feareth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is thy daughter due to be his wife: therefore another could not have her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Then Raguel said: I doubt not but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath regarded my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and tears in his sight.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> he hath therefore made you come to me, that this maid might be <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a> to one of her own kindred, according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>: and now doubt not but I will give her to thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And taking the right hand of his daughter, he gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying: The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> be with you, and may he join you together, and fulfil his <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> in you.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And taking paper they made a writing of the marriage.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And afterwards they made merry, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And Raguel called to him <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> his wife, and bade her to prepare another chamber.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And she brought Sara her daughter in thither, and she wept.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And she said to her: Be of good cheer, my daughter: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> give thee <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the trouble thou hast undergone.</span></p>
