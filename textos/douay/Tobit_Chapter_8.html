<h1>Tobit Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="h1a">Tobias burns part of the fish's liver, and Raphael binds the devil. Tobias and Sarah pray.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And after they had supped, they brought in the young man to her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And Tobias remembering the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> word, took out of his bag part of the liver, and laid it upon burning coals.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Raphael took the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and bound him in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Then Tobias exhorted the virgin, and said to her: Sara, arise, and let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to day, and tomorrow, and the next day: because for these three nights we are joined to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and when the third night is over, we will be in our own wedlock.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For we are the children of saints, and we must not be joined together like <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> that know not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> So they both arose, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> earnestly both together that health might be given them,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And Tobias said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of our fathers, may the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavens</a> and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all thy creatures that are in them, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Thou madest <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> of the slime of the earth, and gavest him <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> for a helper.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And now, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, thou knowest, that not for fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> do I take my sister to wife, but only for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of posterity, in which thy <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> may be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> for ever and ever.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Sara also said: Have mercy on us, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, have mercy on us, and let us grow old both together in health.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it came to pass about the cockcrowing, Raguel ordered his servants to be called for, and they went with him together to dig a grave.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For he said: Lest perhaps it may have happened to him, in like manner as it did to the other seven husbands, that went in unto her.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And when they had prepared the pit, Raguel went back to his wife, and said to her:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Send one of thy maids, and let her see if he be dead, that I may bury him before it be day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> So she sent one of her maidservants, who went into the chamber, and found them safe and sound, sleeping both together.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> And returning she brought the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> news: and Raguel and <a href="../cathen/01530c.htm">Anna</a> his wife <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And said: We <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because it hath not happened as we suspected.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For thou hast shown thy mercy to us, and hast shut out from us the enemy that persecuted us.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And thou hast taken pity upon two only children. Make them, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee more fully: and to offer up to thee a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of thy praise, and of their health, that all nations may know, that thou alone art <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And immediately Raguel commanded his servants, to fill up the pit they had made, before it was day.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he spoke to his wife to make ready a feast, and prepare all kind of provisions that are necessary for such as go a journey.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> He caused also two fat kine, and four wethers to be killed, and a banquet to be prepared for all his neighbours, and all his friends,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And Raguel adjured Tobias, to abide with him two weeks.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> And of all things which Raguel possessed, he gave one half to Tobias, and made a writing, that the half that remained should after their decease come also to Tobias.</span></p>
