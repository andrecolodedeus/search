<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And she brought them through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, and carried them over through a great water.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And they sung to thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and they praised with one accord thy victorious hand.</span><br />
