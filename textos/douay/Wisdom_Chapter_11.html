<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> She prospered their works in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The holy prophet...</strong> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> They went through <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wildernesses</a> that were not inhabited, and in <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert places</a> they pitched their tents.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> They stood against their enemies, and revenged themselves of their adversaries. <span class="stiki"><strong>Their enemies...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalecites</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> They were thirsty, and they called upon thee, and water was given them out of the high rock, and a refreshment of their thirst out of the hard stone.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For by what things their enemies were punished, when their drink failed them, while the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> abounded therewith, and rejoiced: <span class="stiki"><strong>By what things, etc...</strong> The meaning is, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who wrought a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to punish the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> by thirst, when he turned all their waters into blood, (at which time the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, who were exempt from those plagues, had plenty of water), wrought another <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in favour of his own people in their thirst, by giving them water out of the rock.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> By the same things they in their need were benefited.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For instead of a fountain of an ever running river, thou gavest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood to the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And whilst they were diminished for a manifest reproof of their murdering the infants, thou gavest to thine abundant water unlooked for:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Showing by the thirst that was then, how thou didst exalt thine, and didst kill their adversaries.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For when they were tried, and chastised with mercy, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> were judged with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and tormented.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For thou didst admonish and try them as a father: but the others, as a severe king, thou didst examine and condemn.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For whether absent or present, they were tormented alike.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For a double affliction came upon them, and a groaning for the remembrance of things past.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For when they heard that by their punishments the others were benefited, they remembered the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, wondering at the end of what was come to pass. <span class="stiki"><strong>By their punishments, etc...</strong> That is, that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> had been benefited and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> favoured in the same kind, in which they had been punished.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For whom they scorned before, when he was thrown out at the time of his being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedly</a> exposed to perish, him they admired in the end, when they saw the event: their thirsting being unlike to that of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But for the foolish devices of their iniquity, because some being deceived worshipped dumb serpents and worthless beasts, thou didst send upon them a multitude of dumb beasts for vengeance: <span class="stiki"><strong>Dumb beasts...</strong> Viz., frogs, sciniphs, flies, and locusts.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> That they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that by what things a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, by the same also he is tormented.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For thy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->almighty<!--</a>--> hand, which made the world of matter without form, was not unable to send upon them a multitude of bears, or fierce lions,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Or unknown beasts of a new kind, full of rage; either breathing out a fiery vapour, or sending forth a stinking smoke, or shooting horrible sparks out of their eyes:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Whereof not only the hurt might be able to destroy them, but also the very sight might kill them through fear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Yea, and without these, they might have been slain with one blast, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by their own deeds, and scattered by the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For great power always belonged to thee alone: and who shall resist the strength of thy arm?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For the whole world before thee is as the least grain of the balance, and as a drop of the morning dew, that falleth down upon the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But thou hast mercy upon all, because thou canst do all things, and overlookest the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for the sake of repentance.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For thou <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> all things that are, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatest</a> none of the things which thou hast <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">made</a>: for thou didst not appoint, or make any thing <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hating</a> it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> And how could any thing endure, if thou wouldst not? or be preserved, if not called by thee?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> But thou sparest all: because they are thine, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovest</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span></blockquote>
