<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> For those ancient inhabitants of thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land, whom thou didst abhor,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Because they did works <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateful</a> to thee by their sorceries, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>,</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> That the land which of all is most dear to thee, might receive a worthy colony of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Yet even those thou sparedst as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and didst send wasps forerunners of thy host, to destroy them by little and little.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Not that thou wast unable to bring the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, or by cruel beasts, or with one rough word to destroy them at once:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But executing thy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgments<!--</a>--> by degrees, thou gavest them place of repentance, not being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that they were a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> natural, and that their thought could never be changed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For it was a <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a> seed from the beginning: neither didst thou for fear of any one give pardon to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For who shall say to thee: What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->? or who shall come before thee to be a revenger of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? or who shall accuse thee, if the nations perish, which thou hast made?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but thou, who hast care of all, that thou shouldst show that thou dost not give <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Neither shall king, nor tyrant, in thy sight inquire about them whom thou hast destroyed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For so much then, as thou art <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, thou orderest all things <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>: thinking it not agreeable to the power, to condemn him who deserveth not to be punished.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For thy power is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: and because thou art <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of all, thou makest thyself gracious to all.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For thou showest thy power, when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> thee to be absolute in power, and thou convincest the boldness of them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thee not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> But thou being master of power, judgest with tranquillity, and with great favour disposest of us: for thy power is at hand when thou wilt.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> But thou hast taught thy people by such works, that they must be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and humane, and hast made thy children to be of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>: because in <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judging<!--</a>-->, thou givest place for repentance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy servants, and that deserved to die, with so great deliberation, giving them time and place whereby they might be changed from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> With what circumspection hast thou judged thy own children, to whose <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> thou hast sworn, and made covenants of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> promises?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Therefore whereas thou chastisest us, thou scourgest our enemies very many ways, to the end that when we judge we may think on thy <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>: and when we are judged, we may <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> for thy mercy.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Wherefore thou hast also greatly tormented them, who, in their life, have lived foolishly and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, by the same things which they <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->worshipped<!--</a>-->.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For they went astray for a long time in the ways of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, holding those things for gods which are the most worthless among beasts, living after the manner of children without understanding.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Therefore thou hast sent a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> upon them, as senseless children, to mock them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> But they that were not amended by mockeries and reprehensions, experienced the worthy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For seeing, with indignation, that they suffered by those very things which they took for gods, when they were destroyed by the same, they acknowledged him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom in time past they denied that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>: for which cause the end also of their condemnation came upon them.</span></blockquote>
