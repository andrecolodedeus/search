<div class="h1a">Idolaters are inexcusable: and those most of all that worship for gods the works of the hands of men.</div>

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are vain, in whom there is not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and who by these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that are seen, could not understand him that is, neither by attending to the works have acknowledged who was the workman:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> But have <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the great water, or the sun and moon, to be the gods that rule the world.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> With whose beauty, if they, being delighted, took them to be gods: let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of them is more beautiful than they: for the first author of beauty made all those things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Or if they admired their power, and their effects, let them understand by them, that he that made them, is mightier than they:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For by the greatness of the beauty, and of the creature, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">creator</a> of them may be seen, so as to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> thereby.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But yet as to these they are less to be blamed. For they perhaps <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, seeking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and desirous to find him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For being conversant among his works, they search: and they are persuaded that the things are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which are seen.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But then again they are not to be pardoned.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For if they were able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> so much as to make a judgment of the world: how did they not more easily find out the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> thereof?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But unhappy are they, and their <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> is among the dead, who have called gods the works of the hand of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, gold and silver, the inventions of art, and the resemblances of beasts, or an unprofitable stone the work of an ancient hand.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Or if an artist, a carpenter, hath cut down a tree proper for his use in the wood, and skilfully taken off all the bark thereof, and with his art, diligently formeth a vessel profitable for the common uses of life,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And useth the chips of his work to dress his meat:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And taking what was left thereof, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for nothing, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, carveth it diligently when he hath nothing else to do, and by the skill of his art fashioneth it, and maketh it like the image of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Or the resemblance of some beast, laying it over with vermilion, and painting it red, and covering every spot that is in it:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And maketh a convenient dwelling place for it, and setting it in a wall, and fastening it with iron,</span>
<span class="poe003"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Providing for it, lest it should fall, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is unable to help itself: for it is an image, and hath need of help.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And then maketh <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to it, enquiring concerning his <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->substance<!--</a>-->, and his children, or his marriage. And he is not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And for health he maketh supplication to the weak, and for life <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayeth</a> to that which is dead, and for help calleth upon that which is unprofitable:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> journey he petitioneth him that cannot walk: and for getting, and for working, and for the event of all things he asketh him that is unable to do any thing.</span></blockquote>
