<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Again, another designing to sail, and beginning to make his voyage through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more frail than the wood that carrieth him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For this the desire of gain devised, and the workman built it by his skill.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But thy <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, governeth it: for thou hast made a way even in the sea, and a most sure path among the waves,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Showing that thou art able to save out of all things, yea, though a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> went to sea without art.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> But that the works of thy wisdom might not be idle: therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also trust their lives even to a little wood, and passing over the sea by ship, are saved.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And from the beginning also, when the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> giants perished, the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the world fleeing to a vessel, which was governed by thy hand, left to the world seed of generation.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> is the wood, by which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> cometh</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> But the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a> that is made by hands, is <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">cursed</a>, as well it, as he that made it: he because he made it; and it because being frail it is called a god.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are hateful alike.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For that which is made, together with him that made it, shall suffer torments.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Therefore there shall be no respect had even to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: because the creatures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are turned to an abomination, and a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For the beginning of fornication is the devising of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: and the invention of them is the corruption of life.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For by the vanity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> they came into the world: and therefore they shall be found to come shortly to an end.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For a father being afflicted with bitter grief, made to himself the image of his son, who was quickly taken away: and him who then had died as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he began now to worship as a god, and appointed him rites and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> among his servants.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> Then, in process of time, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> custom prevailing, this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was kept as a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, and statues were worshipped by the commandment of tyrants.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And those whom <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> could not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in presence, because they dwelt far off, they brought their resemblance from afar, and made an express image of the king, whom they had a mind to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: that by this their diligence, they might <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as present, him that was absent.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And to the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->worshipping<!--</a>--> of these, the singular diligence also of the artificer helped to set forward the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For he being willing to please him that employed him, laboured with all his art to make the resemblance in the best manner.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And the multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, carried away by the beauty of the work, took him now for a god, that little before was but <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And this was the occasion of deceiving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life: for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> serving either their affection, or their kings, gave the incommunicable <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> to stones and wood.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And it was not enough for them to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> about the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but whereas they lived in a great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, they call so many and so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> peace.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For either they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> their own children, or use hidden <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, or keep watches full of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> So that now they neither keep life, nor marriage undefiled, but one killeth another through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, or grieveth him by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And all things are mingled together, blood, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">theft</a>, and dissimulation, corruption and unfaithfulness, tumults and <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, disquieting of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Forgetfulness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, defiling of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, changing of nature, disorder in marriage, and the irregularity of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">uncleanness</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For the worship of abominable <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> is the cause, and the beginning and end of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For either they are mad when they are merry: or they <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophesy</a> lies, or they live <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, or easily forswear themselves.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For whilst they trust in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, which are without life, though they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> amiss, they look not to be hurt.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> But for both these things they shall be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished, because they have thought not well of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, giving heed to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and have sworn <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, in guile despising <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse31">31</span> For it is not the power of them, by whom they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> vengeance of sinners always punisheth the transgression of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</span></blockquote>
