<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> The potter also tempering soft earth, with labour fashioneth every vessel for our service, and of the same clay he maketh both vessels that are for clean uses, and likewise such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of these vessels, the potter is the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judge<!--</a>-->.</span><br />

<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But his care is, not that he shall labour, nor that his life is short, but he striveth with the goldsmiths and silversmiths: and he endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to make vain things.</span><br />
