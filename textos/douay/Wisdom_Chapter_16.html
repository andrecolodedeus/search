<div class="h1a">God's different dealings with the Egyptians and with his own people.</div>

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> For these things, and by the like things to these, they were worthily punished, and were destroyed by a multitude of beasts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Instead of which punishment, dealing well with thy people, thou gavest them their desire of delicious food, of a new taste, preparing for them quails for their meat:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> To the end, that they indeed desiring food, by means of those things that were shown and sent among them, might loath even that which was necessary to satisfy their desire. But these, after <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->suffering<!--</a>--> want for a short time, tasted a new meat. <span class="stiki"><strong>They indeed desiring food, etc...</strong> He means the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>; who were restrained even from that food which was necessary, by the frogs and the flies that were sent amongst them, and spoiled all their meats. -- Ibid. <strong>But these...</strong> Viz., the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For it was requisite that inevitable destruction should come upon them that exercised tyranny: but to these it should only be shown how their enemies were destroyed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For when the fierce rage of beasts came upon these, they were destroyed by the bitings of crooked serpents.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> endured not for ever, but they were troubled for a short time for their correction, having a sign of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->. <span class="stiki"><strong>Sign of salvation...</strong> The brazen serpent, an emblem of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ our Saviour</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For he that turned to it, was not healed by that which he saw, but by thee, the Saviour of all.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And in this thou didst show to our enemies, that thou art he who deliverest from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For the bitings of locusts, and of flies, killed them, and there was found no remedy for their life: because they were worthy to be destroyed by such things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But not even the teeth of venomous serpents overcame thy children: for thy mercy came and healed them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For they were examined for the remembrance of thy words, and were quickly healed, lest falling into deep forgetfulness, they might not be able to use thy help.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaster, that healed them, but thy word, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, which healeth all things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For it is thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, that hast power of life and death, and leadest down to the gates of death, and bringest back again:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> indeed killeth through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and when the spirit is gone forth, it shall not return, neither shall he call back the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is received:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> But it is impossible to escape thy hand:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> that denied to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thee, were scourged by the strength of thy arm, being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by strange waters, and hail, and rain, and consumed by fire.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> And which was wonderful, in water, which extinguisheth all things, the fire had more force: for the world fighteth for the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>The fire had more force...</strong> Viz., when the fire and hail mingled together laid waste the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <a href="../douay/exo009.htm">Exodus 9</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For at one time the fire was mitigated, that the beasts which were sent against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> might not be burnt, but that they might see, and perceive that they were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And at another time the fire, above its own power, burnt in the midst of water, to destroy the fruits of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> land.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Instead of which things, thou didst feed thy people with the food of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and gavest them bread from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, prepared without labour; having in it all that is delicious, and the sweetness of every taste.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For thy sustenance showed thy sweetness to thy children, and serving every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will, it was turned to what every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> liked.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> But snow and ice endured the force of fire, and melted not: that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the fire, burning in the hail, and flashing in the rain, destroyed the fruits of the enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> But this same again, that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> might be nourished, did even forget its own strength.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For the creature serving thee, the Creator, is made fierce against the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for their punishment: and abateth its strength for the benefit of them that trust in thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Therefore even then it was transformed into all things, and was <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to thy <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that nourisheth all, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of them that desired it of thee:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> That thy children, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, whom thou <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">lovedst</a>, might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but thy word preserveth them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in thee.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> For that which could not be destroyed by fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam, presently melted away:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> That it might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, that we ought to prevent the sun to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> thee, and <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> thee at the dawning of the light.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter's ice, and shall run off as unprofitable water.</span></blockquote>
