<h1>Wisdom Chapter 17</h1>
<div class="h1a">The Egyptian darkness.</div>

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> For thy judgments, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, are great, and thy words cannot be expressed: therefore undisciplined <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For while the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thought to be able to have dominion over the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->holy nation<!--</a>-->, they themselves being fettered with the bonds of darkness, and a long night, shut up in their houses, lay there exiled from the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">eternal providence</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And while they thought to lie hid in their obscure <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfullness, being horribly afraid, and troubled with exceeding great astonishment.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For neither did the den that held them, keep them from fear: for noises coming down troubled them, and sad visions appearing to them, affrighted them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And no power of fire could give them light, neither could the bright flames of the stars enlighten that horrible night.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> But there appeared to them a sudden fire, very dreadful: and being struck with the fear of that face, which was not seen, they thought the things which they saw to be worse:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And the delusions of their magic art were put down, and their boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a sick <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, were sick themselves of a fear worthy to be laughed at.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For though no terrible thing disturbed them: yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear and denying that they saw the air, which could by no means be avoided.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For whereas <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is fearful, it beareth witness of its condemnation: for a troubled <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> always forecasteth grievous things.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And while there is less expectation from within, the greater doth it count the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of that cause which bringeth the torment.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> But they that during that night, in which nothing could be done, and which came upon them from the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">lowest and deepest hell</a>, slept the same sleep,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters, sometimes fainted away, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> failing them: for a sudden and unlooked for fear was come upon them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Moreover, if any of them had fallen down, he was kept shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> without irons.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For if any one were a husbandman, or a shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he endured a necessity from which he could not fly.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For the whole world was enlightened, with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But over them only was spread a heavy night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.</span></blockquote>
