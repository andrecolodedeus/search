<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> But thy <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> had a very great light, and they heard their voice indeed, but did not see their shape. And because they also did not suffer the same things, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> thee:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And they that before had been wronged, gave thanks, because they were not hurt now: and asked this gift, that there might be a difference.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Therefore they received a burning <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of fire</a> for a guide of the way which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, and thou gavest them a harmless sun of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> entertainment. <span class="stiki"><strong>A harmless sun...</strong> A light that should not hurt or molest them; but that should be an agreeable guest to them.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> The others indeed were worthy to be deprived of light, and imprisoned in darkness, who kept thy children shut up, by whom the pure light of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> was to be given to the world.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And whereas they thought to kill the babes of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>: one child being cast forth, and saved to reprove them, thou tookest away a multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water. <span class="stiki"><strong>One child...</strong> Viz., <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For that night was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> before by our fathers, that assuredly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> they had trusted to, they might be of better <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> So thy people received the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and destruction of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For as thou didst punish the adversaries so thou didst also encourage and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorify</a> us.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> For the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> children of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> secretly, and they unanimously ordered a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> should receive both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> alike, singing now the praises of the fathers. <span class="stiki"><strong>Of good men...</strong> Viz., of the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarchs</a>. Their children, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, offered in private the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a>; and were regulating what they were to do in their journey, when that last and most dreadful plague was coming upon their enemies.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were bewailed.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And the servant suffered the same punishment as the master, and a common <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> suffered in like manner as the king.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> So all alike had innumerable dead, with one kind of death. Neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed. <span class="stiki"><strong>The noblest offspring...</strong> That is, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> For whereas they would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> any thing before by <!--<a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">-->reason<!--</a>--> of the enchantments, then first upon the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, they acknowledged the people to be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For while all things were in quiet silence, and the night was in the midst of her course,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> Thy Almighty word leaped down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> from thy royal throne, as a fierce conqueror into the midst of the land of destruction,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> With a sharp sword carrying thy unfeigned commandment, and he stood and filled all things with death, and standing on the earth, reached even to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Then suddenly visions of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> dreams troubled them, and fears unlooked for came upon them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And one thrown here, another there, half dead, showed the cause of his death.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> For the visions that troubled them foreshowed these things, lest they should perish, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why they suffered these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> also were afterwards touched by an assault of death, and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>: but thy <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> did not long continue;</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> For a blameless <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> made haste to pry for the people, bringing forth the shield of his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> making supplication, withstood the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and put an end to the calamity, showing that he was thy servant.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And he overcame the disturbance, not by strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him that punished them, alleging the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and covenant made with the fathers.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and cut off the way to the living.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For in the priestly robe which he wore, was the whole world: and in the four rows of the stones, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the fathers was graven, and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And to these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> only of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> was enough.</span></blockquote>
