<div class="h1a">The vain reasonings of the wicked: their persecuting the just, especially the Son of God.</div>

<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> For they have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right: The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is no remedy, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> hath been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have returned from hell:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> For we are born of nothing, and after this we shall be as if we had not been: for the breath in our nostrils is smoke: and speech a spark to move our heart,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Which being put out, our body shall be ashes, and our spirit shall be poured abroad as soft air, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, which is driven away by the beams of the sun, and overpowered with the heat thereof:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And our <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> in time shall be forgotten, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall have any remembrance of our works.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For our time is as the passing of a shadow, and there is no going back of our end: for it is fast sealed, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> returneth:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Let us fill ourselves with costly wine, and <a href="../cathen/11229a.htm">ointments</a>: and let not the flower of the time pass by us.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> Let us crown ourselves with roses, before they be withered: let no meadow escape our riot.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Let none of us go without his part in luxury: let us everywhere leave tokens of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: for this is our portion, and this our lot.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Let us oppress the poor <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not spare the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the ancient grey hairs of the aged.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But let our strength be the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Let us, therefore, lie in wait for the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us with transgressions of the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, and divulgeth against us the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of our way of life.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> He boasteth that he hath the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and calleth himself the <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">son of God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> He is become a <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->censurer<!--</a>--> of our thoughts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He is grievous unto us, even to behold: for his life is not like other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a>, and his ways are very different.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorieth</a> that he hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for his father.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Let us see then if his words be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and let us <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> what shall happen to him, and we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what his end shall be.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For if he be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> Let us examine him by outrages and tortures, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his meekness, and try his patience.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> Let us condemn him to a most shameful death: for there shall be respect had unto him by his words.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> These things they thought, and were deceived: for their own <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> blinded them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> And they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the secrets of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor hoped for the wages of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor esteemed the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> incorruptible, and to the image of his own likeness he made him.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> But by the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, death came into the world:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> And they follow him that are of his side.</span></blockquote>
