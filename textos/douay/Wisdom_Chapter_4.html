<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> How beautiful is the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chaste</a> <a href="../cathen/06412c.htm">generation</a> with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: for the memory thereof is immortal: because it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> both with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> When it is present, they imitate it: and they desire it, when it hath withdrawn itself, and it triumpheth crowned for ever, winning the reward of undefiled conflicts.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> But the multiplied brood of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not thrive, and bastard slips shall not take deep root, nor any fast foundation.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And if they flourish in branches for a time, yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For the branches not being perfect, shall be broken, and their fruits shall be unprofitable, and sour to eat, and fit for nothing.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For the children that are born of unlawful beds, are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> against their parents in their trial.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he be prevented with death, shall be in rest.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is grey hairs.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And a spotless life is old age.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> He pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was beloved, and living among sinners, he was translated.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> He was taken away, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> For the bewitching of vanity obscureth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and the wandering of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> overturneth the innocent mind.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Being made perfect in a short space, he fulfilled a long time.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: therefore he hastened to bring him out of the midst of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a>: but the people see this, and understand not, nor lay up such things in their hearts:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> That the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his mercy is with his <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and that he hath respect to his chosen.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> that is dead, condemneth the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> that are living, and youth soon ended, the long life of the unjust.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For they shall see the end of the wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and it shall not understand what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath designed for him, and why the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath set him in safety.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> They shall see him, and shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">despise</a> him: but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> shall laugh them to scorn.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And they shall fall after this without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and be a reproach among the dead for ever: for he shall burst them puffed up and speechless, and shall shake them from the foundations, and they shall be utterly laid waste: they shall be in sorrow, and their memory shall perish.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> They shall come with fear at the thought of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquities</a> shall stand against them to convict them.</span></blockquote>
