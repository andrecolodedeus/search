<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Then shall the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> stand with great constancy against those that have afflicted them, and taken away their labours.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> These seeing it, shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Saying within themselves, <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->repenting<!--</a>-->, and groaning for anguish of spirit: These are they, whom we had sometime in derision, and for a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of reproach.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> We fools esteemed their life <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and their end without <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Behold, how they are numbered among the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their lot is among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Therefore we have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> from the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the light of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> hath not shined unto us, and the sun of understanding hath not risen upon us.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> We wearied ourselves in the way of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> and destruction, and have walked through hard ways, but the way of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> we have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> What hath <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> profited us? or what advantage hath the boasting of riches brought us?</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> All those things are passed away like a shadow, and like a post that runneth on,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And as a ship, that passeth through the waves: whereof when it is gone by, the trace cannot be found nor the path of its keel in the waters:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Or as when a bird flieth through the air, of the passage of which no mark can be found, but only the sound of the wings beating the light air, and parting it by the force of her flight: she moved her wings, and hath flown through, and there is no mark found afterwards of her way:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Or as when an arrow is shot at a mark, the divided air quickly cometh together again, so that the passage thereof is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> So we also being born, forthwith ceased to be: and have been able to show no mark of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: but are consumed in our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> Such things as these the sinners said in hell:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> For the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is as dust, which is blown away with the wind, and as a thin froth which is dispersed by the storm: and a smoke that is scattered abroad by the wind: and as the remembrance of a guest of one day that passeth by.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> But the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> shall live for evermore: and their reward is with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and the care of them with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> Therefore shall they receive a kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a crown of beauty at the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: for with his right hand he will cover them, and with his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> arm he will defend them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> And his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> will take armour, and he will arm the creature for the revenge of his enemies.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> He will put on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> as a breastplate, and will take <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> instead of a helmet:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> He will take equity for an invincible shield:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And he will sharpen his severe <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> for a spear, and the whole world shall fight with him against the unwise.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> Then shafts of lightning shall go directly from the clouds, as from a bow well bent, they shall be shot out, and shall fly to the mark.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> And thick hail shall be cast upon them from the stone casting <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the rivers shall run together in a terrible manner.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> A mighty wind shall stand up against them, and as a whirlwind shall divide them: and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">iniquity</a> shall bring all the earth to a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty.</span></blockquote>
