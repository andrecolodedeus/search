<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Wisdom is better than strength: and a wise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is better than a strong <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Hear, therefore, ye kings, and understand, learn ye that are <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judges<!--</a>--> of the ends of the earth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> Give ear, you that rule the people, and that please yourselves in multitudes of nations:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> For power is given you by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, and strength by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>, who will examine your works: and search out your thoughts:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Because being <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of his kingdom, you have not judged rightly, nor kept the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>--> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor walked according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> Horribly and speedily will he appear to you: for a most severe <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>--> shall be for them that bear rule.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> For to him that is little, mercy is granted: but the mighty shall be mightily tormented.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not except any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> person, neither will he stand in awe of any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> greatness: for he made the little and the great, and he hath equally care of all.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> But a greater punishment is ready for the more mighty.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> To you, therefore, O kings, are these my words, that you may learn wisdom, and not fall from it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> For they that have kept <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> things <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, shall be justified: and they that have learned these things, shall find what to answer.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> Covet ye, therefore, my words, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them, and you shall have instruction.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Wisdom is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and never fadeth away, and is easily seen by them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her, and is found by them that seek her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> She preventeth them that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> her, so that she first showeth herself unto them.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> He that awaketh early to seek her, shall not labour: for he shall find her sitting at his door.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> To think, therefore, upon her, is perfect understanding: and he that watcheth for her, shall quickly be secure.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, and she showeth herself to them cheerfully in the ways, and meeteth them with all <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> For the beginning of her is the most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> desire of discipline.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> And the care of discipline is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the keeping of her <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->laws<!--</a>-->: and the keeping of her <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->laws<!--</a>--> is the firm foundation of incorruption:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> And incorruption bringeth near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting kingdom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> If then your delight be in thrones, and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wisdom, that you may reign for ever.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Love</a> the light of wisdom, all ye that bear rule over peoples.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> Now what wisdom is, and what was her origin, I will declare: and I will not hide from you the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but will seek her out from the beginning of her birth, and bring the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her to light, and will not pass over the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> Neither will I go with consuming <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>: for such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> shall not be partaker of wisdom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> Now the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the whole world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> Receive, therefore, instruction by my words, and it shall be profitable to you.</span></blockquote>
