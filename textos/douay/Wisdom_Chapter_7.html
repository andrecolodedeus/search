<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> I myself am a mortal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, like all others, and of the race of him, that was first made of the earth, and in the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be flesh.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the pleasure of sleep concurring.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And being born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, that is made alike, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with great cares.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have one entrance into life, and the like going out.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Wherefore I wished, and understanding was given me: and I called upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <!--<a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">-->spirit<!--</a>--> of wisdom came upon me:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Neither did I compare unto her any <a href="../cathen/14304c.htm">precious stone</a>: for all gold, in comparison of her, is as a little sand; and silver, in respect to her, shall be counted as clay.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for her light cannot be put out.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> Now all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches through her hands,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I rejoiced in all these: for this wisdom went before me, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that she was the mother of them all.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and her riches I hide not.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> For she is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> treasure to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: which they that use, become the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being commended for the gifts of discipline.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath given to me to speak as I would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and skill of works.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> For he hath given me the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things that are: to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse18">18</span> The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their courses, and the changes of seasons,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse19">19</span> The revolutions of the year, and the dispositions of the stars,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse20">20</span> The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse21">21</span> And all such things as are hid, and not foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe001"><span class="verse" id="verse22">22</span> For in her is the spirit of understanding; <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent,</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse23">23</span> Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all things, and containing all spirits: intelligible, pure, subtile:</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse24">24</span> For wisdom is more active than all active things; and reacheth everywhere, by reason of her purity.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse25">25</span> For she is a vapour of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a certain pure emanation of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>: and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse26">26</span> For she is the brightness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light, and the unspotted mirror of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> majesty, and the image of his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse27">27</span> And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, she maketh the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse28">28</span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loveth</a> none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse29">29</span> For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse30">30</span> For after this cometh night, but no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can overcome wisdom.</span></blockquote>
