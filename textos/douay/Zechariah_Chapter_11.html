<blockquote class="biblepoem"><span class="poe000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> Open thy gates, O <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a>, and let fire devour thy <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a>. <span class="stiki"><strong>O Libanus...</strong> So <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and more particularly the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a>, is called by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, from its height, and from its being built of the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a> of <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Libanus</a>. -- Ibid. <strong>Thy cedars...</strong> Thy princes and chief <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</span></span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> Howl, thou fir tree, for the <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a> is fallen, for the mighty are laid waste: howl, ye oaks of Basan, because the fenced forest is cut down.</span><br />
<span class="poe002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> The voice of the howling of the shepherds, because their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is laid waste: the voice of the roaring of the lions, because the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> is spoiled.</span></blockquote>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: Feed the flock of the slaughter,</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Which they that possessed, slew, and repented not, and they sold them, saying: <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">Blessed</a> be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, we are become rich: and their shepherds spared them not.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I will no more spare the inhabitants of the land, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: behold I will deliver the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall destroy the land, and I will not deliver it out of their hand. <span class="stiki"><strong>Every one into his neighbour's hand, etc...</strong> This alludes to the last siege of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in which the different factions of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> destroyed one another; and they that remained fell into the hands of their king, that is, of the Roman emperor, of whom they had said (<a href="../douay/joh019.htm#verse15">John 19:15</a>), <em>we have no king but <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a></em>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And I will feed the flock of slaughter for this, O ye poor of the flock. And I took unto me two rods, one I called Beauty, and the other I called a Cord, and I fed the flock. <span class="stiki"><strong>Two rods...</strong> Or shepherd's staves, meaning the different ways of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> dealing with his people; the one, by sweet means, called the rod of Beauty: the other, by bands and punishments, called the Cord. And where both these rods are made of no use or effect by the obstinacy of sinners, the rods are broken, and such sinners are given up to a reprobate sense, as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And I cut off three shepherds in one month, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was straitened in their regard: for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also varied in my regard. <span class="stiki"><strong>Three shepherds in one month...</strong> That is, in a very short time. By these three shepherds probably are meant the latter princes and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whose reign was short.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I said: I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die: and that which is cut off, let it be cut off: and let the rest devour every one the flesh of his neighbour.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I took my rod that was called Beauty, and I cut it asunder to make void my covenant, which I had made with all people.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And it was made void in that day: and so the poor of the flock that keep for me, understood that it is the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And I said to them: If it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in your eyes, bring hither my wages: and if not, be quiet. And they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Cast it to the statuary, a handsome price, that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> to the statuary. <span class="stiki"><strong>The statuary...</strong> The <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> word signifies also a potter.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I cut off my second rod that was called a Cord, that I might break the brotherhood between <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> said to me: Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. <span class="stiki"><strong>A foolish shepherd...</strong> This was to represent the foolish, that is, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> princes and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that should rule the people, before their utter desolation.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse16">16</span> For behold I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who shall not visit what is forsaken, nor seek what is scattered, nor heal what is broken, nor nourish that which standeth, and he shall eat the flesh of the fat ones, and break their hoofs.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse17">17</span> O shepherd, and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idol</a>, that forsaketh the flock: the sword upon his arm and upon his right eye: his arm shall quite wither away, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</span></p>
