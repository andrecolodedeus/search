<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And you shall flee to the valley of those mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall be joined even to the next, and you shall flee as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of <a href="../cathen/11379a.htm">Ozias</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come, and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with him.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall be no light, but cold and frost. <span class="stiki"><strong>No light...</strong> Viz., in that dismal time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Antiochus, when it was neither day nor night (<a href="../douay/zec014.htm#verse7">verse 7</a>) because they neither had the comfortable light of the day, nor the repose of the night.</span></span>
