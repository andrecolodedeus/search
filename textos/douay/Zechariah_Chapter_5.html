<div class="h1a">The vision of the flying volume, and of the woman in the vessel.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I turned and lifted up my eyes: and I saw, and behold a volume flying. <span class="stiki"><strong>A volume...</strong> That is, a parchment, according to the form of the ancient books, which, from being rolled up, were called volumes.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I see a volume flying: the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And he said to me: This is the <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">curse</a> that goeth forth over the face of the earth: for every <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a> shall be judged as is there written: and every one that <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sweareth</a> in like manner shall be judged by it.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> I will bring it forth, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>: and it shall come to the house of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">thief</a>, and to the house of him that <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sweareth</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> by my <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a>: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and the stones thereof.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> went forth that spoke in me, and he said to me: Lift up thy eyes, and see what this is, that goeth forth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And I said: What is it? And he said: This is a vessel going forth. And he said: This is their eye in all the earth. <span class="stiki"><strong>This is their eye...</strong> This is what they fix their eye upon: or this is a resemblance and figure of them, viz., of sinners.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And behold a talent of lead was carried, and behold a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> sitting in the midst of the vessel.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he said: This is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And he cast her into the midst of the vessel, and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And I lifted up my eyes and looked: and behold there came out two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and wind was in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a kite: and they lifted up the vessel between the earth and the heaven.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And I said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that spoke in me: Whither do these carry the vessel?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And he said to me: That a house may be built for it in the land of Sennaar, and that it may be established, and set there upon its own basis. <span class="stiki"><strong>The land of Sennaar...</strong> Where <a href="../cathen/02177b.htm">Babel</a> or <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> was built (<a href="../douay/gen011.htm">Genesis 11</a>), where note, that <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">holy writ</a> is often taken for the city of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: that is, for the whole congregation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: as Jerusalem is taken for the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">city</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">people of God</a>.</span></span></p>
