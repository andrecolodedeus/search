<h1>Zechariah Chapter 6</h1>
<div class="h1a">The vision of the four chariots. Crowns are ordered for the high priest, as a type of Christ.</div>

<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold four chariots came out from the midst of two mountains: and the mountains were mountains of brass. <span class="stiki"><strong>Four chariots...</strong> The four great empires of the Chaldeans, Persians, Grecians, and Romans. Or perhaps by the fourth chariot are represented the kings of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and of Asia, the descendants of Ptolemeus and Seleucus.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> And in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot grisled horses, and strong ones.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And I answered, and said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that spoke in me: What are these, my lord?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answered, and said to me: These are the four winds of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, which go forth to stand before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord of all the earth</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> That in which were the black horses went forth into the land of the north, and the white went forth after them: and the grisled went forth to the land of the south. <span class="stiki"><strong>The land of the north...</strong> So <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> is called; because it lay to the north in respect of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The black horses, that is, the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>: and after them Alexander and his Greeks, signified by the white horses, went thither because they conquered <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, executed upon it the judgments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is signified (<a href="../douay/zec006.htm#verse8">verse 8</a>), by the expression of quieting his spirit. -- Ibid. <strong>The land of the south...</strong> <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which lay to the south of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and was occupied first by Ptolemeus, and then by the Romans.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> And they that were most strong, went out, and sought to go, and to run to and fro through all the earth. And he said: Go, walk throughout the earth: and they walked throughout the earth.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And he called me, and spoke to me, saying: Behold they that go forth into the land of the north, have quieted my spirit in the land of the north.</span></p>
<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro001"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> Take of them of the captivity, of Holdai, and of Tobias, and of Idaias; thou shalt come in that day, and shalt go into the house of <a href="../cathen/08523a.htm">Josias</a>, the son of Sophonias, who came out of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> And thou shalt take gold and silver: and shalt make crowns, and thou shalt set them on the head of Jesus the son of Josedec, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, saying: BEHOLD A MAN, THE ORIENT IS HIS NAME: and under him shall he spring up, and shall build a <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> Yea, he shall build a <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>: and he shall bear the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and shall sit, and rule upon his throne: and he shall be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. <span class="stiki"><strong>Between them both...</strong> That is, he shall unite in himself the two offices or dignities of king and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And the crowns shall be to Helem, and Tobias, and Idaias, and to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Hem<!--</a>-->, the son of Sophonias, a memorial in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And they that are far off, shall come and shall build in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of the Lord</a>: and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> sent me to you. But this shall come to pass, if hearing you will hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord your God</a>.</span></p>
