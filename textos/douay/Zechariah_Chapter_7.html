<p class="bibleprose"><span class="pro000"><span class="verse" id="verse1">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Zacharias<!--</a>-->, in the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Casleu.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse2">2</span> When Sarasar, and Rogommelech, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that were with him, sent to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, to entreat the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse3">3</span> To speak to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of the Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, saying: Must I weep in the fifth month, or must I sanctify myself as I have now done for many years? <span class="stiki"><strong>The fifth month...</strong> They <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> on the tenth day of the fifth month; because on that day the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> was burnt. Therefore they inquire whether they are to continue the fast, after the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> is rebuilt. See this query answered in the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->19th<!--</a>--> verse of the following chapter.</span></span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse4">4</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> came to me, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse5">5</span> Speak to all the people of the land, and to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, saying: When you <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a>, and mourned in the fifth and the seventh month for these seventy years: did you keep a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> unto me?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse6">6</span> And when you did eat and drink, did you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse7">7</span> Are not these the words which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> spoke by the hand of the former <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as yet was inhabited, and was <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, both itself and the cities round about it, and there were inhabitants towards the south, and in the plain?</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse8">8</span> And the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of the Lord</a> came to <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Zacharias<!--</a>-->, saying:</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse9">9</span> Thus saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>, saying: <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Judge<!--</a>--> ye <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->judgment<!--</a>-->, and show ye mercy and compassion every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> And oppress not the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">fatherless</a>, and the stranger, and the poor: and let not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> devise <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his heart against his brother.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse11">11</span> But they would not hearken, and they turned away the shoulder to depart: and they stopped their ears, not to hear.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse12">12</span> And they made their heart as the adamant stone, lest they should hear the <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->law<!--</a>-->, and the words which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> sent in his spirit by the hand of the former <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: so a great indignation came from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse13">13</span> And it came to pass that as he spoke, and they heard not: so shall they cry, and I will not hear, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>.</span>
<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse14">14</span> And I dispersed them throughout all kingdoms, which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: and the land was left desolate behind them, so that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> passed through or returned: and they changed the delightful land into a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">wilderness</a>.</span></p>
