<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse10">10</span> For before those days there was no hire for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither was there hire for beasts, neither was there peace to him that came in, nor to him that went out, because of the tribulation: and I let all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> go every one against his neighbour.</span>

<span class="pro002"><span class="verse" id="verse15">15</span> And I had no mercy: so turning again I have thought in these days to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Juda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: fear not.</span>
