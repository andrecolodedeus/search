<h1>A Poem on Easter</h1>

<p> <em>Poem of Venantius Honorius  Clementianus Fortunatus, On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>.</em></p>

<p>The seasons blush varied with the flowery, fair weather , and the gate of the pole lies open with greater light. His path in the heaven raises the fire-breathing  sun higher, who goes forth on his course,  and enters the waters of the ocean. Armed with rays traversing the liquid elements, in this  brief night he stretches out the day in a circle. The brilliant firmament  puts forth its clear countenance, and the bright stars show their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The fruitful earth pours forth its gifts with varied increase,  when the year has well returned its vernal riches.  Soft beds of violets paint the purple plain; the meadows are green with plants,  and the plant shines with its leaves. By degrees gleaming brightness of the flowers  comes forth; all the herbs smile with their blossoms.  The seed being deposited, the grain springs up far and wide  in the fields, promising to be able to overcome the hunger of the husbandman. Having deserted its stem, the vine-shoot bewails its joys; the vine gives water only from the source from which it is wont to give wine. The swelling bud, rising with tender down from the back of its mother, prepares its bosom for bringing forth. Its foliage  having been torn off in the wintry season, the verdant grove now renews its leafy shelter. Mingled together, the willow, the fir, the hazel, the osier,  the elm, the maple, the walnut, each tree applauds, delightful with its leaves. Hence the bee, about to construct its comb, leaving the hive, humming over the flowers, carries off honey with its leg. The bird which, having closed its song, was dumb, sluggish with the wintry cold, returns to its strains. Hence Philomela attunes her notes with her own instruments,  and the air becomes sweeter with the re-echoed melody. Behold, the favour of the reviving world bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that all gifts have returned together with its Lord. For in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Christ rising triumphant after <span style="italic">His descent to</span> the gloomy Tartarus, the grove on every side with its leaves <span style="italic">expresses approval</span>, the plants with their flowers express approval.  The light, the heaven, the fields, and the sea duly praise the God ascending above the stars, having crushed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Behold, He who was crucified reigns as God over all things, and all created objects offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to their Creator. Hail, festive day, to be reverenced throughout the world,  on which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has conquered <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and gains the stars! The changes of the year and of the months, the bounteous light of the days, the splendour of the hours, all things with voice applaud.  Hence, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of you, the wood with its foliage applauds; hence the vine, with its silent shoot, gives thanks. Hence the thickets now resound with the whisper of birds; amidst these the sparrow sings with exuberant  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. O Christ, You Saviour of the world, merciful Creator and Redeemer, the only offspring from the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, flowing in an indescribable  manner from the heart of Your Parent, You self-existing Word, and powerful from the mouth of Your Father, equal to Him, of one mind with Him, His fellow, coeval with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from whom at first  the world derived its origin! You  suspend the firmament,  You heap together the soil, You pour forth the seas, by whose  government all things which are fixed in their places flourish. Who seeing that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was plunged in the depth  <span style="italic">of misery</span>, that You might rescue man, Yourself also became man: nor were You willing only to be born with a body,  but You became flesh, which endured to be born and to die. You undergo  funeral obsequies, Yourself the author of life and <span style="italic">framer</span> of the world, You enter  the path of death, in giving the aid of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The gloomy chains of the infernal law yielded, and chaos feared to be pressed by the presence  of the light. Darkness perishes, put to flight by the brightness of Christ; the thick pall of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>  night falls. But restore the promised  pledge, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> You, O power benign! The third day has returned; arise, my buried One; it is not becoming that Your limbs should lie in the lowly sepulchre, nor that worthless stones should press <span style="italic">that which is</span> the ransom  of the world. It is unworthy that a stone should shut in with a confining  rock, and cover Him in whose fist  all things are enclosed. Take away the linen clothes, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; leave the napkins in the tomb: You are sufficient for us, and without You there is nothing. Release the chained shades of the infernal <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and recall to the upper regions  whatever sinks to the lowest depths. Give back Your face, that the world may see the light; give back the day which flees from us at Your death. But returning, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> conqueror! You altogether filled the heaven!  Tartarus lies depressed, nor retains its rights. The ruler of the lower regions, insatiably opening his hollow jaws, who has always been a spoiler, becomes  a prey to You. You rescue an innumerable people from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of death, and they follow in freedom to the place whither their leader  approaches. The fierce monster in alarm vomits forth the multitude whom he had swallowed up, and the Lamb  withdraws the sheep from the jaw of the wolf. Hence re-seeking the tomb from the lower regions,  having resumed Your flesh, as a warrior You carry back ample trophies to the heavens. Those whom chaos held in punishment  he  has now restored; and those whom death might seek, a new life holds. Oh, sacred King, behold a great part of Your triumph shines forth, when the sacred laver blesses pure <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>! A host, clad in white,  come forth from the bright waves, and cleanse their old  fault in a new stream. The white garment also designates bright <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the shepherd has enjoyments from the snow-white flock. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Felix is added sharing  in this reward, who wishes to give double talents to his Lord. Drawing those who wander in Gentile <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to better things, that a beast of prey may not carry them away, He guards the fold of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Those whom guilty Eve had before infected, He now restores, fed  with abundant milk at the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. By cultivating rustic hearts with mild conversations, a crop is produced from a briar by the bounty of Felix. The Saxon, a fierce nation, living as it were after the manner of wild beasts, when you, O sacred One! Apply a remedy, the beast of prey resembles  the sheep. About to remain with you through an age with the return  of a hundred-fold, you fill the barns with the produce of an abundant harvest. May this people, free from stain, be strengthened  in your arms, and may you bear to the stars a pure pledge to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. May one crown be bestowed on you from on high <span style="italic">gained</span> from yourself , may another flourish gained from your people.</p>
