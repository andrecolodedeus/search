<h1>A Sectional Confession of the Faith</h1>


<h2>1</h2>

<p>Most hostile and alien to the Apostolic Confession are those who speak of the Son as assumed to Himself by the Father out of nothing, and from an emanational origin;  and those who hold the same sentiments with respect to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; those who say that the Son is constituted divine by gift and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; those who regard the name of the Son as one common to servants, and assert that thus He is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of the creature, as becoming, like the creature, existent out of non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and as being first made, and who refuse to admit that He is the only-begotten Son,&mdash; the only One that the Father has, and that He has given Himself to be reckoned in the number of mortals, and is thus reckoned <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>; those who circumscribe the generation of the Son by the Father with a measured interval after the fashion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and refuse to acknowledge that the aeon of the Begetter and that of the Begotten are without beginning; those who introduce three separate and diverse systems of divine worship,  whereas there is but one form of legitimate service which we have received of old from the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and which has been confirmed by the Lord and preached by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Nor less alienated from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confession are those who hold not the doctrine of the Trinity according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as a relation consisting of three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but impiously conceive it as implying a triple being in a unity (<a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a>), formed in the way of synthesis  and think that the Son is the wisdom in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the same manner as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom subsists in man whereby the man is wise, and represent the Word as being simply like the word which we utter or conceive, without any hypostasis whatever.</p>

<h2>2</h2>

<p>But the Church's Confession, and the Creed that brings <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the world, is that which deals with the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Word, and bears that He gave Himself over to the flesh of man which He acquired of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, while yet He conserved His own identity, and sustained no divine transposition or mutation, but was brought into conjunction with the flesh after the similitude of man; so that the flesh was made one with the divinity, the divinity having assumed the capacity of receiving the flesh in the fulfilling of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. And after the dissolution of death there remained to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> flesh a perpetual impassibility and a changeless <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, man's original <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> being taken up into it again by the power of the divinity, and being ministered then to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the appropriation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. </p>

<h2>3</h2>

<p>If, then, there are any here, too, who falsify the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, either by attributing to the divinity as its own what belongs to the humanity&mdash; progressions,  and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> coming with accession  &mdash; or by separating from the divinity the progressive and passible body, as if subsisted of itself apart&mdash;these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> also are outside the confession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. No one, therefore, can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God unless he apprehends the Son; for the Son is the wisdom by whose instrumentality all things have been created; and these created objects declare this wisdom, and God is recognised in the wisdom. But the wisdom of God is not anything similar to the wisdom which man possesses, but it is the perfect wisdom which proceeds from the perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and abides for ever, not like the thought of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which passes from him in the word that is spoken and (straightway) ceases to be. Wherefore it is not wisdom only, but also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor is it Word only, but also Son. And whether, then, one discerns God through creation, or is taught to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, it is impossible either to apprehend Him or to learn of Him apart from His wisdom. And he who calls upon God rightly, calls on Him through the Son; and he who approaches Him in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fellowship, comes to Him through Christ. Moreover, the Son Himself cannot be approached apart from the Spirit. For the Spirit is both the life and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> formation of all things;  and God sending forth this Spirit through the Son makes the creature  like Himself.</p>

<h2>4</h2>

<p>One therefore is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, one the Word, one the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the life, the sanctification of all. And neither is there another God as Father,  nor is there another Son as <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, nor is there another Spirit as quickening and sanctifying. Further, although the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are called both gods, and sons, and spirits, they are neither filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, nor are made like the Son and God. And if, then, any one makes this affirmation, that the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, simply as being Himself filled with divinity, and not as being generated of divinity, he has belied the Word, he has belied the Wisdom, he has lost the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; he has fallen away into the worship of the creature, he has taken up the impiety of the Greeks, to that he has gone back; and he has become a follower of the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who, supposing the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> to be but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> son, have refused to accept Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have declined to acknowledge Him as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But it is impious to think of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> as merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and to think of the works which are done by Him as abiding, while He abides not Himself. And if any one says that the Christ works all things only as commanded by the Word, he will both make the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> idle,  and will change the Lord's order into servitude. For the slave is one altogether under command, and the created is not competent to create; for to suppose that what is itself created may in like manner create other things, would imply that it has ceased to be like the creature. </p>

<h2>5</h2>

<p>Again, when one speaks of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as an object made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,  he will no longer be able to apprehend all things as being sanctified in (the) Spirit. For he who has sanctified one, sanctifies all things. That man, consequently, belies the fountain of sanctification, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who denudes Him of the power of sanctifying, and he will thus be precluded from numbering Him with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; he makes nought, too, of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> (ordinance of) <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and will no more be able to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and august Trinity.  For either we must apprehend the perfect Trinity  in its natural and genuine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or we shall be under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of speaking no more of a Trinity, but only of a Unity;  or else, not numbering  created objects with the Creator, nor the creatures with the Lord of all, we mast also not number what is sanctified with what sanctifies; even as no object that is made can be numbered with the Trinity, but in the name of the Holy Trinity <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and invocation and worship are administered. For if there are three several glories, there must also be three several forms of cultus with those who impiously worship the creature; for if there is a distinction in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the objects worshipped, there ought to be also with these men a distinction in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the worship offered. What is recent  surely is not to be worshipped along with what is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; for the recent comprehends all that has had a beginning, while mighty and measureless is lie who is before the ages. He, therefore, who supposes some beginning of times in the life of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, therewith also cuts off any possibility of numbering the Son and the Spirit with the Father. For as we acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to be one, so ought we also to acknowledge the substance in the Godhead to be one, and one also the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Trinity.</p>

<h2>6</h2>

<p>Moreover, the capital clement of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Word. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, therefore, that it was without any change in the Divinity that the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Word took place with a view to the renewal of humanity. For there took place neither mutation nor transposition, nor any circumscription in will,  as regards the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> energy  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but while that remained in itself the same, it also effected the work of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> with a view to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world: and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, living  on earth after man's fashion, maintained likewise in all the divine presence, fulfilling all things, and being united  properly and individually with flesh; and while the sensibilities proper to the flesh were there, the <em>divine</em> energy maintained the impassibility proper to itself. Impious, therefore, is the man who introduces the passibility  into the energy. For the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> appeared in fashion as a man when He undertook the economy  upon the earth; and He fulfilled the law for men by His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and by His sufferings He did away with man's sufferings, and by His death He abolished death, and by his resurrection He brought life to light; and now we look for His appearing from heaven in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for the life and judgment of all, when the resurrection of the dead shall take place, to the end that recompense may be made to all according to their desert.</p>

<h2>7</h2>

<p>But some treat the Holy Trinity  in an awful manner, when they confidently assert that there are not three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and introduce (the idea of) a person devoid of subsistence.  Wherefore we clear ourselves of Sabellius, who says that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are the same. For he holds that the Father is He who speaks, and that the Son is the Word that abides in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and becomes manifest at the time of the creation,  and thereafter reverts to God on the fulfilling of all things. The same affirmation he makes also of the Spirit. We forswear this, because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>&mdash; namely, Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>&mdash; are declared to possess the one Godhead: for the one divinity showing itself forth according to nature in the Trinity  establishes the oneness of the nature; and thus there is a (divinity that is the) property of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, according to the word, <q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the Father; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060282"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 8:6</a></span> and there is a divinity hereditary  in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as it is written, <q>The Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060284"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John 1:1</a></span> and there is a divinity present according to nature in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> into wit, what subsists as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>&mdash; according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> statement, <q>You are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060285"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 3:6</a></span></p>

<h2>8</h2>

<p>Now the person in each declares the independent being and subsistence.  But divinity is the property of the Father; and whenever the divinity of these three is spoken of as one, testimony is borne that the property  of the Father belongs also to the Son and the Spirit: wherefore, if the divinity may be spoken of as one in three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the trinity is established, and the unity is not dissevered; and the oneness Which is naturally the Father's is also acknowledged to be the Son's and the Spirit's. If one, however, speaks of one person as he may speak of one divinity, it cannot be that the two in the one are as one.  For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> addresses the Father as one in respect of divinity, and speaks of the Son as one in respect of lordship: <q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom are all things, and we by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060289"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 8:6</a></span> Wherefore if there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and one Lord, and at the same time one person as one divinity in one lordship,  how can credit be given to (this distinction in) the words <q>of whom</q> and <q>by whom,</q> as has been said before? We speak, accordingly, not as if we separated the lordship from the divinity, nor as estranging the one from the other, but as unifying them in the way warranted by actual fact and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and we call the Son God with the property of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,  as being His image and offspring; and we call the Father Lord, addressing Him by the name of the One Lord, as being His Origin and Begettor.</p>

<h2>9</h2>

<p>The same position we hold respecting the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who has that unity with the Son which the Son has with the Father. Wherefore let the hypostasis of the Father be discriminated by the appellation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but let not the Son be cut off from this appellation, for He is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, let the person of the Son also be discriminated by the appellation of Lord; only let not God be dissociated from that, for He is Lord as being the Father of the Lord. And as it is proper to the Son to exercise lordship, for He it is that made (all things) by Himself, and now rules the things that were made, while at the same time the Father has a prior possession of that property, inasmuch as He is the Father of Him who is Lord; so we speak of the Trinity as One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet not as if we made the one by a synthesis of three: for the subsistence that is constituted by synthesis is something altogether partitive and imperfect.  But just as the designation Father is the expression of originality and generation, so the designation Son is the expression of the image and offspring of the Father. Hence, if one were to ask how there is but One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if there is also a God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we would reply that that is a term proper to the idea of original causation,  so far as the Father is the one First Cause.  And if one were also to put the question, how there is but One Lord, if the Father also is Lord, we might answer that again by saying that He is so in so far as He is the Father of the Lord; and this difficulty shall meet us no longer.</p>

<h2>10</h2>

<p>And again, if the impious say, How will there not be three Gods and three Persons, on the supposition that they have one and the same divinity?&mdash; we shall reply: Just because God is the Cause and Father of the Son; and this Son is the image and offspring of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not His brother; and the Spirit in like manner is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, as it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060295"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a></span> And in earlier times we have this declaration from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David: <q>By the word of the Lord were the heavens established, and all the power of them by the breath (spirit) of His mouth.</q>  And in the beginning of the book of the creation  it is written thus: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved upon the face of the waters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060298"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis 1:2</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in his Epistle to the Romans says <q>But you are not in the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if so be that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwell in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060299"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans 8:9</a></span> And again he says: <q>But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwells in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060300"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans 8:11</a></span> And again: <q>As many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060301"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans 8:14-15</a></span> And again: <q>I say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I lie not, my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> also bearing me <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060302"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse1">Romans 9:1</a></span> And again: <q>Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of hope fill you with all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060303"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse13">Romans 15:13</a></span></p>

<h2>11</h2>

<p>And again, writing to those same Romans, he says: <q>But I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, because of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is given to me of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I should be the minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, ministering the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the offering up of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might be acceptable, being sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. I have therefore whereof I may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in those things which pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2>12</h2>

<p>Again, in the Epistle to the Corinthians he says: <q>For my speech and my preaching was not in the enticing words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not stand in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060308"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 2:4-5</a></span> And again he says: <q>As it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. But God has revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060309"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 2:9-11</a></span> And again he says: <q>But the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060310"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 2:14</a></span></p>

<h2>13</h2>

<p>Do you see that all through Scripture the Spirit is preached, and yet nowhere named a creature? And what can the impious have to say if the Lord sends forth His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>?<span class="stiki" id="note060311"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a></span> Without contradiction, that implies a communion and unity between them, according to which there are neither three divinities nor (three) lordships; but, while there remain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and certainly the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the real unity of the three must be acknowledged. And in this way proper credit will be given to the <em>sending</em> and the <em>being sent</em>  (in the Godhead), according to which the Father has sent forth the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son in like manner sends forth the Spirit. For one of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> surely could not (be said to) send Himself; and one could not speak of the Father as incarnate. For the articles of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will not concur with the vicious tenets of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; and it is right that our conceptions should follow the inspired and apostolic doctrines, and not that our impotent fancies should coerce the articles of our divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>14</h2>

<p>But if they say, How can there be three Persons, and how but one Divinity?&mdash; we shall make this reply: That there are indeed three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, inasmuch as there is one person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and one of the Lord the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and one of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and yet that there is but one divinity, inasmuch as the Son is the Image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who is One&mdash;that is, He is God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in like manner the Spirit is called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and that, too, of nature according to the very substance,  and not according to simple participation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And there is one substance  in the Trinity, which does not subsist also in the case of objects that are made; for there is not one substance in God and in the things that are made, because none of these is in substance God. Nor, indeed, is the Lord one of these according to substance, but there is one Lord the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and we speak also of one Divinity, and one Lordship, and one Sanctity in the Trinity; because the Father is the Cause  of the Lord, having begotten Him <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, and the Lord is the Prototype  of the Spirit. For thus the Father is Lord, and the Son also is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and of God it is said that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060317"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a></span></p>

<h2>15</h2>

<p>We therefore acknowledge one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the one First Cause, and one Son, very God of very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, possessing of nature the Father's divinity,&mdash; that is to say, being the same in substance with the Father;  and one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who by nature and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sanctifies all, and makes divine, as being of the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Those who speak either of the Son or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as a creature we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>. All other things we hold to be objects made, and in subjection,  created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, (and) sanctified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Further, we acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was made a <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, having taken to Himself the flesh from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, not in name, but in reality; and that He is both the perfect <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the (perfect) <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>&mdash;that the Person is but one, and that there is one worship  for the Word and the flesh that He assumed. And we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who constitute different worships, one for the divine and another for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and who worship the man born of Mary as though He were another than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <q>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060322"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John 1:1</a></span> And we worship Him who was made man on account of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not indeed as made perfectly like in the like body,  but as the Lord who has taken to Himself the form of the servant. We acknowledge the passion of the Lord in the flesh, the resurrection in the power of His divinity, the ascension to heaven, and His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> appearing when He comes for the judgment of the living and the dead, and for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<h2>16</h2>

<p>And since some have given us trouble by attempting to subvert our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and by affirming of Him that He was not God incarnated, but a man linked with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for this reason we present our confession on the subject of the aforementioned matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and reject the faithless <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> opposed thereto. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having been incarnated in the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, retains also His proper energy pure, possessing a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> unsubjected by the natural  and fleshly affections, and holding the flesh and the fleshly motions divinely and sinlessly, and not only unmastered by the power of death, but even destroying death. And it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God unincarnate that has appeared incarnate, the perfect One with the genuine and divine perfection; and in Him there are not two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Nor do we affirm that there are four to worship, viz., God and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and man and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Wherefore we also <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who show their impiety in this, and who thus give the <em>man</em> a place in the divine doxology. For we hold that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was made man on account of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in order that we might receive the likeness of the heavenly, and be made divine  after the likeness of Him who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> by nature, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> according to the flesh, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>17</h2>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> therefore in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, in one First Cause, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the law and of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the just and good; and in one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, Image of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Maker of all things seen and unseen, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and only-begotten Offspring, and Eternal Word, living and self-subsistent and active.  always being with the Father; and in one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> advent of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who of the Virgin Mary took flesh, and endured sufferings and death in our stead, and came to resurrection on the third day, and was taken up to heaven; and in His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> appearing yet to come; and in one <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the resurrection of the flesh, and life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<h2>18</h2>

<p>We acknowledge that the Son and the Spirit are consubstantial with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that the substance of the Trinity is one&mdash;that is, that there is one divinity according to nature, the Father remaining unbegotten, and the Son being begotten of the Father in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> generation, and not in a formation by will,  and the Spirit being sent forth <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> from the substance of the Father through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, with power to sanctify the whole creation. And we further acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and was manifested in the flesh-movement  received of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and did not simply energize in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And those who have fellowship with men that reject the <em>consubstantiality</em> as a doctrine foreign to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and speak of any of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the Trinity as created, and separate that person from the one natural divinity, we hold as aliens, and have fellowship with none such.  There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and there is only one divinity. But the Son also is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as being the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> image of the one and only divinity, according to generation and the nature which He has from the Father. There is one Lord the Son; but in like manner there is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who bears over  the Son's lordship to the creature that is sanctified. The Son sojourned in the world, having of the Virgin received flesh, which He filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for the sanctification of us all; and having given up the flesh to death, He destroyed death through the resurrection that had in view the resurrection of us all; and He ascended to heaven, exalting and glorifying men in Himself; and He comes the second time to bring us again <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<h2>19</h2>

<p>One is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, both before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. The same (Son) is both man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both these together as though one; and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is not one person, and the man Jesus another person, but the same who subsisted as Son before was made one with flesh by Mary, so constituting Himself a perfect, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and sinless man, and using that economical position for the renewal of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all the world. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, being Himself the perfect Person, has thus the perfect Word begotten of Him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, not as a word that is spoken, nor yet again as a son by adoption, in the sense in which <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men are called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as a Son who is in nature God. And there is also the perfect <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> supplied  of God through the Son to the sons of adoption, living and life-giving, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and imparting <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to those who partake of Him&mdash;not like an unsubstantial breath  breathed into them by man, but as the living Breath proceeding from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore the Trinity is to be adored, to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, to be honoured, and to be reverenced; the Father being apprehended in the Son even as the Son is of Him, and the Son being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, inasmuch as He is of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and being manifested in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to the sanctified.</p>

<h2>20</h2>

<p>And that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Trinity is to be worshipped without either separation or alienation, is taught us by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who says in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be with you all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060333"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 13:13</a></span> And again, in that epistle he makes this explanation: <q>Now He which establishes us with you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and has anointed us, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060334"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 1:21-22</a></span> And still more clearly he writes thus in the same epistle: <q>When <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is liberty. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, even as by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060335"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 3:15-18</a></span></p>

<h2>21</h2>

<p>And again <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>That mortality might be swallowed up of life. Now He that has wrought us for the selfsame thing is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060336"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 5:4-5</a></span> And again he says: <q>Approving ourselves as the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060337"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 6:4</a></span> and so forth. Then he adds these words: <q>By kindness, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unfeigned, by the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060338"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 6:6-7</a></span> Behold here again the saint has defined the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Trinity, naming <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And again he says: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in you? If any man defile the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him shall God destroy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060339"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a></span> And again: <q>But you are washed, but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060340"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a></span> And again: <q>What! Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your bodies are the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is in you, which you have of God? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060341"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 6:19</a></span> <q>And I think also that I have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060342"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse40">1 Corinthians 7:40</a></span></p>

<h2>22</h2>

<p>And again, speaking also of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the cloud and in the sea, he says: <q>And they all drank of the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060343"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a></span> And again he says: <q>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Lord, but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the sane Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; to another discerning of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will. For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For by one Spirit are we all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into one body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060344"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 12:3-13</a></span> And again he says: <q>For if he who comes preaches another Christ whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit that you have received not, or another gospel which you have not obtained, you will rightly be kept back.</q> </p>

<h2>23</h2>

<p>Do you see that the Spirit is inseparable from the divinity? And no one with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> apprehensions could fancy that He is a creature. Moreover, in the Epistle to the Hebrews he writes again thus: <q>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God also bearing them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, both with signs and wonders, and with various <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and gifts of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note060346"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse3">Hebrews 2:3-4</a></span> And again he says in the same epistle: <q>Wherefore, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> says, Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> me, and saw my works forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in their heart; for  they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my ways: as I swore in my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, that they should not enter into my rest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060348"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse7">Hebrews 3:7-11</a></span> And there, too, they ought to give ear to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, for he by no means separates the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from the divinity of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but clearly sets forth the discourse of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as one from the person of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and thus as given expression to  by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as it has been represented in the before-mentioned sayings. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Trinity is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in accordance with these testimonies of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; albeit all through the inspired Scriptures numberless announcements are supplied us, all confirmatory of the apostolic and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>A fragment of the same Declaration of Faith, accompanied by glosses. From Gregory Thaumaturgus, as they say, in his Sectional Confession of Faith.</h2> 

<p>To maintain two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>  in the one Christ, makes a Tetrad of the Trinity, says he; for he expressed himself thus: <q>And it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the unincarnate, that was manifested in the flesh, perfect with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and divine perfection, not with two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; nor do we speak of worshipping four (<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>), viz., <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and man, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> First, however, this passage is misapprehended, and is of very doubtful import. Nevertheless it bears that we should not speak of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, lest, by thus acknowledging Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as in the perfect divinity, and yet speaking of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, we should make a Tetrad of the divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, counting that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father as one, and that of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as one, and that of the man as one, and that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as one. But, again, it bears also against recognising two divine natures,  and rather for acknowledging Him to be perfect God in one natural divine perfection, and not in two; for his object is to show that He became incarnate without change, and that He retains the divinity without duplication.  Accordingly he says shortly: <q>And while the affections of the flesh spring, the energy  retains the impassibility proper to it. He, therefore, who introduces the (idea of) passion into the energy is impious; for it was the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that appeared in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, having taken to Himself the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> economy.</q></p>
