<h1>A fragment from On the Trinity</h1>

<p>Gregory Thaumaturgus, Bishop of Neo-Caesareia in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>,  near successor of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in his discourse on the Trinity, speaks thus:&mdash; </p>

<p>I see in all three essentials&mdash; substance, genus, name. We speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, servant, curator (<em>curatorem</em>)&mdash;man, by reason of substance; servant, by reason of genus or condition; curator, by reason of denomination. We speak also of Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: these, however, are not names which have only supervened at some after period, but they are subsistences. Again, the denomination of <em>man</em> is not in actual fact a denomination, but a substance common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and is the denomination proper to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Moreover, names are such as these&mdash;Adam, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, Jacob: these, I say, are names. But the Divine Persons are names indeed: and the names are still the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> then signify that which is and subsists&mdash;which is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The name also of the nature signifies subsistence;  as if we should speak of the <em>man</em>. All (the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>) are one nature, one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, one will, and are called the Holy Trinity; and these also are haines subsistent, one nature in three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and one genus. But the person of the Son is composite in its oneness (<em>unita est</em>), being one made up of two, that is, of divinity and humanity together, which two constitute one. Yet the divinity does not consequently receive any increment, but the Trinity remains as it was. Nor does anything new befall the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> even or the names, but these are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and without time. No one, however, was sufficient to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these until the Son being made flesh manifested them, saying: <q>Father, I have manifested Your name to men; glorify me also, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me as Your Son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060362"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;17:6</a></span> And on the mount the Father spoke, and said, <q>This is my beloved Son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060363"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> And the same sent His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> at the Jordan. And thus it was declared to us that there is an Eternal Trinity in equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Besides, the generation of the Son by the Father is incomprehensible and ineffable; and because it is spiritual, its investigation becomes impracticable: for a spiritual object can neither be understood nor traced by a corporeal object, for that is far removed from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. We men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed the generation proper to us, as also that of other objects; but a spiritual matter is above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> condition, neither can it in any manner be understood by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Spiritual substance can neither perish nor be dissolved; ours, however, as is easy to understand, perishes and is dissolved. How, indeed, could it be possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is limited on six sides&mdash; by east, west, south, north, deep, and sky&mdash; understand a matter which is above the skies, which is beneath the deeps, which stretches beyond the north and south, and which is present in every place, and fills all vacuity? But if, indeed, we are able to scrutinize spiritual substance, its excellence <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> would be undone. Let us consider what is done in our body; and, furthermore, let us see whether it is in our power to ascertain in what manner thoughts are born of the heart, and words of the tongue, and the like. Now, if we can by no means apprehend things that are done in ourselves, how could it ever be that we should understand the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the uncreated Creator, which goes beyond every mind? Assuredly, if this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> were one that could be penetrated by man, the inspired John would by no means have affirmed this: <q>No man has seen God at any time.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note060364"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> He then, whom no man has seen at any time,&mdash; whom can we reckon Him to resemble, so that thereby we should understand His generation? And we, indeed, without ambiguity apprehend that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dwells in us in union with the body; but still, who has ever seen his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Who has been able to discern its conjunction with his body? This one thing is all we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certainly, that there is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> within us conjoined with the body. Thus, then, we reason and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Word is begotten by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, albeit we neither possess nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the clear <em>rationale</em> of the fact. The Word Himself is before every creature&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> from the Eternal, like spring from spring, and light from light. The vocable <em>Word</em>, indeed, belongs to those three genera of words which are named in Scripture, and which are not substantial,&mdash; namely, the word <em>conceived</em>,  the word <em>uttered</em>,  and the word <em>articulated</em>.  The word <em>conceived</em>, certainly, is not substantial. The word <em>uttered</em>, again, is that voice which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> hear from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the prophetic speech itself; and even this is not substantial. And, lastly, the word <em>articulated</em> is the speech of man formed forth in air (<em>aere efformatus</em>), composed of terms, which also is not substantial.  But the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is substantial, endowed with an exalted and enduring nature, and is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with Himself, and is inseparable from Him, and can never fall away, but shall remain in an everlasting union. This Word created heaven and earth, and in Him were all things made. He is the arm and the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, never to be separated from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in virtue of an indivisible nature, and, together with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is without beginning. This Word took our substance of the Virgin Mary; and in so far as He is spiritual indeed, He is indivisibly equal with the Father; but in so far as He is corporeal, He is in like manner inseparably equal with us. And, again, in so far as He is spiritual, He supplies in the same equality (<em>aequiparat</em>) the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, inseparably and without limit. Neither were there two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but only one nature of the Holy Trinity before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Word, the Son; and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Trinity remained one also after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Son. But if any one, moreover, believes that any increment has been given to the Trinity by reason of the assumption of humanity by the Word, he is an alien from us, and from the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church. This is the perfect, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God. Praise to the Holy Trinity for ever through the ages of the ages. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
