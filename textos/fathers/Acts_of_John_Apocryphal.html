<h1>Acts of John (Apocryphal)</h1>

<p><strong>About His Exile and Departure.</strong></p>

<p>When Agrippa, whom, on account of his plotting against Peace, they <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, was king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian C&aelig;sar</a>, coming with a great army, invested Jerusalem; and some prisoners of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he took and slew, others he destroyed by famine in the siege, and most he banished, and at length scattered up and down. And having destroyed the temple, and put the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vessels on board a ship, he sent them to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to make for himself a temple of peace, and adorned it with the spoils of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</p>

<p>And when <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> was dead, his son <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, having got possession of the kingdom, along with his other wrongful acts, set himself also to make a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the righteous men. For, having learned that the city was filled with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, remembering the orders given by his father about them, he purposed casting them all out of the city of the Romans. And some of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and gave <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> a book, in which was written as follows:&mdash; </p>

<p>O <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, C&aelig;sar and king of all the world, as many of us as are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> entreat you, as suppliants we beseech of your power not to banish us from your divine and benignant countenance; for we are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to you, and the customs, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and practices, and policy, doing wrong in nothing, but being of the same mind with the Romans. But there is a new and strange nation, neither agreeing with other nations nor consenting to the religious observances of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, uncircumcised, inhuman, lawless, subverting whole houses, proclaiming a man as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all assembling together  under a strange name, that of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. These men reject <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, paying no heed to the law given by Him, and proclaim to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> a man born of ourselves, Jesus by name, whose <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and brothers and all his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> have been connected with the Hebrews; whom on account of his great <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> fooleries we gave up to the cross. And they add another <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> lie to their first one: him that was nailed up and buried, they glorify as having risen from the dead; and, more than this, they <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assert that he has been taken up by  clouds into the heavens.</p>

<p>At all this the king, being affected with rage, ordered the senate to publish a decree that they should <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> all who confessed themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Those, then, who were found in the time of his rage, and who reaped the fruit of patience, and were crowned in the triumphant contest against the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, received the repose of incorruption.</p>

<p>And the fame of the teaching of John was spread abroad in Rome; and it came to the ears of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> that there was a certain Hebrew in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, John by name, who spread a report about the seat of empire of the Romans, saying that it would quickly be rooted out, and that the kingdom of the Romans would be given over to another. And <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, troubled by what was said, sent a centurion with soldiers to seize John, and bring him. And having gone to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, they asked where John lived. And having come up to his gate, they found him standing before the door; and, thinking that he was the porter, they inquired of him where John lived. And he answered and said: I am he. And they, despising his common, and low, and poor appearance, were filled with threats, and said: Tell us the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And when he declared again that he was the man they sought, the neighbours moreover bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to it, they said that he was to go with them at once to the king in Rome. And, urging them to take provisions for the journey, he turned and took a few dates, and straightway went forth.</p>

<p>And the soldiers, having taken the public conveyances, travelled fast, having seated him in the midst of them. And when they came to the first change, it being the hour of breakfast, they entreated him to be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and to take bread, and eat with them. And John said: I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> indeed, but in the meantime I do not wish to take any food. And they started, and were carried along quickly. And when it was evening they stopped at a certain inn; and as, besides, it was the hour of supper, the centurion and the soldiers being most kindly disposed, entreated John to make use of what was set before them. But he said that he was very tired, and in want of sleep more than any food. And as he did this each day, all the soldiers were struck with amazement, and were afraid lest John should die, and involve them in danger. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> showed him to them as more cheerful. And on the seventh day, it being the Lord's day, he said to them: Now it is time for me also to partake of food. And having washed his hands and face, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and brought out the linen cloth, and took one of the dates, and ate it in the sight of all.</p>

<p>And when they had ridden a long time they came to the end of their journey, John thus <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. And they brought him before the king, and said: Worshipful king, we bring to you John, a god, not a man; for, from the hour in which we apprehended him, to the present, he has not tasted bread. At this <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> being amazed, stretched out his mouth on account of the wonder, wishing to salute him with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>; but John bent down his head, and kissed his breast. And <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> said: Why have you done this? Did you not think me worthy to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> you? And John said to him: It is right to adore the hand of God first of all, and in this way to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the mouth of the king; for it is written in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> books, The heart of a king is in the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082437"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;21:1</a></span> </p>

<p>And the king said to him: Are you John, who said that my kingdom would speedily be uprooted, and that another king, Jesus, was going to reign instead of me? And John answered and said to him:  You also shall reign for many years given you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and after you very many others; and when the times of the things upon earth have been fulfilled, out of heaven shall come a King, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, Judge of living and dead, to whom every nation and tribe shall confess, through whom every earthly power and dominion shall be brought to nothing, and every mouth speaking great things shall be shut. This is the mighty Lord and King of everything that has breath and flesh,  the Word and Son of the living One, who is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>At this <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> said to him: What is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of these things? I am not persuaded by words only; words are a sight of the unseen.  What can you show in earth or heaven by the power of him who is destined to reign, as you say. For he will do it, if he is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And immediately John asked for a deadly poison. And the king having ordered poison to be given to him, they brought it on the instant. John therefore, having taken it, put it into a large cup, and filled it with water, and mixed it, and cried out with a loud voice, and said: In Your name, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, I drink the cup which You will sweeten; and the poison in it do Thou mingle with Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and make it become a draught of life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for the healing of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, for digestion and harmless assimilation, for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not to be repented of, for an undeniable testimony of death as the cup of thanksgiving.  And when he had drunk the cup, those standing beside <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> expected that he was going to fall to the ground in convulsions. And when John stood, cheerful, and talked with them safe, <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> was enraged against those who had given the poison, as having spared John. But they swore by the fortune and health of the king, and said that there could not be a stronger poison than this. And John, understanding what they were whispering to one another, said to the king: Do not take it ill, O king, but let a trial be made,  and you shall learn the power of the poison. Make some condemned criminal be brought from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And when he had come, John put water into the cup, and swirled it round, and gave it with all the dregs to the condemned criminal. And he, having taken it and drunk, immediately fell down and died.</p>

<p>And when all wondered at the signs that had been done, and when <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> had retired and gone to his palace, John said to him: O <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, king of the Romans, did you contrive this, that, you being present and bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, I might today become a murderer? What is to be done about the dead body which is lying? And he ordered it to be taken and thrown away. But John, going up to the dead body, said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Maker of the heavens, Lord and Master of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, of glories, of powers, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Your only begotten Son, give to this man who has died for this occasion a renewal of life, and restore him his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> may learn that the Word is much more powerful than poison, and is the ruler of life. And having taken him by the hand, he raised him up alive.</p>

<p>And when all were glorifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wondering at the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of John, <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> said to him: I have put forth a decree of the senate, that all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be summarily dealt with, without trial; but since I find from you that they are innocent, and that their religion is rather beneficial, I banish you to an island, that I may not seem myself to do away with my own decrees. He asked then that the condemned criminal should be let go; and when he was let go, John said: Depart, give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has this day delivered you from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and from death.</p>

<p>And while they were standing, a certain home-born slave of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian's</a>, of those in the bed-chamber, was suddenly seized by the unclean <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and lay dead; and word was brought to the king. And the king was moved, and entreated John to help her. And John said: It is not in man to do this; but since you know how to reign, but do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from whom you have received it, learn who has the power over both you and your kingdom. And he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> thus: O Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of every kingdom, and master of every creature, give to this maiden the breath of life. And having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, he raised her up. And <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, astonished at all the wonders, sent him away to an island, appointing for him a set time.</p>

<p>And straightway John sailed to <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a>, where also he was deemed worthy to see the revelation of the end. And when <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> was dead, Nerva succeeded to the kingdom, and recalled all who had been banished; and having kept the kingdom for a year, he made <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> his successor in the kingdom. And when he was king over the Romans, John went to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, and regulated all the teaching of the church, holding many conferences, and reminding them of what the Lord had said to them, and what duty he had assigned to each. And when he was old and changed, he ordered <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over the church.</p>

<p>And what like his end was, or his departure from men, who cannot give an account of? For on the following day, which was the Lord's day, and in the presence of the brethren, he began to say to them: Brethren, and fellow-servants, and co-heirs, and copartners of the kingdom of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Lord what <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> He has shown you through me, what wonders, what cures, what signs, what gracious gifts, teachings, rulings, rests, services, glories, graces, gifts, faiths, communions; how many things you have seen with your eyes, that ear has not heard. Be strong, therefore, in Him, remembering Him in all your doings, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the dispensation that has come to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for the sake of which the Lord has worked. He then, through me, exhorts you: Brethren, I wish to remain without grief, without insult, without treachery, without punishment. For He also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> insult from you, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also dishonour, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also treachery, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also punishment from those that disobey His commandments. Let not therefore our God be grieved, the good, the compassionate, the merciful, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, the pure, the undefiled, the only, the one, the immutable, the sincere, the guileless, the slow to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, He that is higher and more exalted than every name that we speak or think of&mdash; our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Let Him <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> along with us because we conduct ourselves well; let Him be glad because we live in purity; let Him rest because we behave reverently; let Him be pleased because we live in fellowship; let Him smile because we are sober-minded; let Him be delighted because we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. These things, brethren, I communicate to you, pressing on to the work set before me, already perfected for me by the Lord. For what else have I to say to you? Keep the sureties of your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; keep His presence, that shall not be taken away from you. And if then ye <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, He will forgive you what you have done in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; but if, after you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, and He has had compassion upon you, you return to the like courses, even your former offenses will be laid to your charge, and you shall have no portion or compassion before His face. <span class="stiki" id="note082442"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse26">Hebrews&nbsp;10:26</a></span> </p>

<p>And when he had said this to them, he thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>: Jesus, who wreathed this crown by Your twining, who hast inserted these many flowers into the everlasting flower of Your countenance, who hast sown these words among them, be You Yourself the protector and healer of Your people.  You alone are benignant and not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>, alone merciful and kind, alone a Saviour, and just; You who always sees what belongs to all, and are in all, and everywhere present, God Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; who with Your gifts and Your compassion coverest those that hope in You; who <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> intimately those that everywhere speak against us, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name, do Thou alone, O Lord, help Your servants with Your watchful care. So be it, Lord.</p>

<p>And having asked bread, he gave thanks thus, saying: What praise, or what sort of offering, or what thanksgiving, shall we, breaking the bread, invoke, but You only? We glorify the name by which You have been called by the Father; we glorify the name by which You have been called through the Son; we glorify the resurrection which has been manifested to us through You; of You we glorify the seed,  the word, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pearl, the treasure, the plough, the net, <span class="stiki" id="note082444"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm">Matthew&nbsp;13</a></span> the majesty, the diadem, Him called <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> for our sakes, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the rest, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the freedom, the place of refuge in You. For  You alone are Lord, the root of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and the fountain of incorruption, and the seat of the ages;  You who has  been called all these for our sakes, that now we, calling upon You through these, may recognise Your illimitable majesty, presented to us by Your presence, that can be seen only by the pure, seen in Your only Son.</p>

<p>And having broken the bread, he gave it to us, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for each of the brethren, that he might be worthy of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> of the Lord. He also therefore, having likewise tasted it, said: To me also let there be a portion with you, and peace, O beloved. And having thus spoken, and confirmed the brethren, he said to Eutyches, also named Verus: Behold, I appoint you a minister  of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and I entrust to you the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Be mindful, therefore, of the commandments of the Lord; and if you should fall into trials or dangers, be not afraid: for you shall fall under many troubles, and you shall be shown to be an eminent <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>  of the Lord. Thus, then, Verus, attend to the flock as a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, until the time appointed for your testimony.</p>

<p>And when John had spoken this, and more than this, having entrusted to him the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he says to him: Take some brethren, with baskets and vessels, and follow me. And Eutyches, without considering,  did what he was bid. And the blessed John having gone forth from the house, went outside of the gates, having told the multitude to stand off from him. And having come to the tomb of one of our brethren, he told them to dig. And they dug. And he says: Let the trench be deeper. And as they dug, he conversed with those who had come out of the house with him, building them up, and furnishing them thoroughly into the majesty of the Lord. And when the young men had finished the trench, as he had wished, while we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>  nothing, he takes off the clothes he had on, and throws them, as if they were some bedding, into the depth of the trench; and, standing in only his drawers,  stretched forth his hands, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</p>

<p>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hast chosen us for the mission  of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who hast sent us out into the world, who hast declared Yourself through the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; who hast never rested, but always savest from the foundation of the world; who hast made Yourself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through all nature; who hast made our wild and savage nature quiet and peaceable; who hast given Yourself to it when thirsting after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;  who hast <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> its adversary, when it took refuge in You; who hast given it Your hand, and raised it from the things done in Hades; who hast shown it its own enemy; who hast in purity turned its thoughts upon You, O Christ Jesus, Lord of things in heaven, and law of things on earth, the course of things aerial, and guardian of things etherial, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of those under the earth, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Your own people, receive also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Your John, which has been certainly deemed worthy by You,  You who has  preserved me also till the present hour pure to Yourself, and free from intercourse with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; who, when I wished in my youth to marry, appeared to me, and say, I am in need of you, John; who strengthened for me beforehand my bodily weakness; who, when a third time I wished to marry, said to me at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, in the sea, John, if you were not mine, I would let you marry; who hast opened up the sight of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and hast favoured my bodily  eyes; who, when I was looking about me, called even the gazing upon a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> hateful; who delivered me from temporary show, and preserve me for that which endures for ever; who separated me from the filthy <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the flesh; who stopped up  the secret disease of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and cut out its open actions; who afflicted and banish him who rebelled in me; who established my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to You spotless and unimpaired; who gave me undoubting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in You; who hast drawn out for me pure thoughts towards You; who hast given me the due reward of my works; who hast set it in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to have no other possession than You alone: for what is more precious than  You? Now, O Lord, when I have accomplished Your stewardship with which I was entrusted, make me worthy of Your repose, having wrought that which is perfect in You, which is ineffable <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And as I go to You, let the fire withdraw, let darkness be overcome, let the furnace be slackened, let Gehenna be extinguished, let the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> follow, let the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> be afraid, let the princes be broken in pieces, let the powers of darkness fall, let the places on the right hand stand firm, let those on the left abide not, let the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> be muzzled, let <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> be laughed to scorn, let his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> be tamed, let his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> be broken, let his children be trodden under foot, and let all his root be uprooted; and grant to me to accomplish the journey to You, not insulted, not despitefully treated, and to receive what You have promised to those that live in purity, and that have loved a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life.</p>

<p>And gazing towards heaven, he <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and having sealed himself altogether, he stood and said to us, Peace and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with you, brethren! And sent the brethren away. And when they went on the morrow they did not find him, but his sandals, and a fountain welling up. And after that they remembered what had been said to Peter by the Lord about him: For what does it concern you if I should wish him to remain until I come? <span class="stiki" id="note082454"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;21:22</a></span> And they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God for the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> that had happened. And having thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, they retired praising and blessing the benignant <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because to Him is due <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> now and ever, and to ages of ages. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
