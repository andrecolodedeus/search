<h1>Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus</h1>

<h2>Disputation of the First Day</h2>

<p>On the fifth of September, the most renowned men Arcadius Augustus (the second time) and Rufinus being consuls, a disputation against Fortunatus, an elder of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, was held in the city of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo Regius</a>, in the baths of Sossius, in the presence of the people.</p>

<p>1. Augustine said: I now regard as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> what formerly I regarded as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I desire to hear from you who are present whether my supposition is correct. First of all I regard it as the height of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom is our one hope, is in any part either violable, or contaminable, or corruptible. This I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> affirms, not indeed in the words that I now use; for when you are questioned you confess that God is incorruptible, and absolutely inviolable, and incontaminable; but when you begin to expound the rest of your system, we are compelled to declare Him corruptible, penetrable, contaminable. For you say that another race of darkness, whatever it may be, has rebelled against the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; but that Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He saw what ruin and desolation threatened his domains, unless he should make some opposition to the adverse race and resist it, sent this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, from whose commingling with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the race of darkness the world was framed. Hence it is that here good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> labor, serve, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, are corrupted: that they may see the need of a liberator, who should purge them from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, loose them from this commingling with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and liberate them from servitude. I think it impious to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> ever feared any adverse race, or was under necessity to precipitate us into afflictions.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you have been in our midst, that is, have lived as an adherent among the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, these are the principles of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The matter now to be considered is our mode of living, the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> alleged crimes for which we are maltreated. Therefore let the good men present hear from you whether these things with which we are charged and which we have thrown in our teeth are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false. For from your instruction, and from your exposition and explanation, they will have been able to gain more correct information about our mode of life, if it shall have been set forth by you.</p>

<p>2. Augustine said: I was among you, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and morals are different questions. I proposed to discuss <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But if those present prefer to hear about morals, I do not decline that question.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: I wish first to purge myself in your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> in which we are polluted, by the testimony of a competent man, (who even now is competent for me), and in view of the future examination of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the just judge, whether he saw in us, or himself practiced by imitation, the things that are now thrown in our teeth?</p>

<p>3. Augustine said: You call me to something else, when I had proposed to discuss <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but concerning your morals only those who are your Elect can fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I was not your Elect, but an Auditor. Hence though I was present at your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> meetings,  as you have asked (whether separately among yourselves you have any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> meetings, God alone and yourselves can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>); yet in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> meetings where I have been present I have seen nothing shameful take place; but only that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that I afterwards learned and approved is denounced, and that you perform your services facing the sun. Besides this I found out nothing new in your meetings, but whoever raises any question of morals against you, raises it against your Elect. But what you who are Elect do among yourselves, I have no means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>. For I have often heard from you that you receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. But since the time of receiving it was concealed from me, how could I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you receive?  So keep the question about morals, if you please, for discussion among your Elect, if it can be discussed. You gave me a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that I today disapprove. This I proposed to discuss. Let a response be made to my proposition.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: And our profession is this very thing: that God is incorruptible, lucid, unapproachable, intenible, impassible, that He inhabits His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> lights, that nothing corruptible proceeds from Him, neither darkness, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, nor anything adverse can be found in His kingdom. But that He sent forth a Saviour like Himself; that the Word born from the foundation of the world, when He had formed the world, after the formation of the world came among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; that He has chosen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> worthy of Himself according to His own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> will, sanctified by celestial command, imbued with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and reason of celestial things; that under His leadership those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will return hence again to the kingdom of God according to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> promise of Him who said: "I am the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the door;"  and "No one can come unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, except through me." These things we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> because otherwise, that is, through another mediator, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> cannot return to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, unless they find Him as the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the door. For Himself said: "He that has seen me, has seen my Father also;" <span class="stiki" id="note140225"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;14:8-9</a></span> and "whosoever shall have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on me shall not taste death forever, but has passed from death unto life, and shall not come into judgment." <span class="stiki" id="note140226"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;5:24</a></span> These things we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and this is the reason of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and according to the strength of our mind we endeavor to act according to His commandments, following after the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this Trinity, Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. </p>

<p>4. Augustine said: What was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being precipitated into death, whom you confess come through Christ from death to life?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Hence now deign to go on and to contradict, if there is nothing besides God.</p>

<p>5. Augustine said: Nay, do you deign to answer the question put to you: What <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has given these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to death?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Nay but do you deign to say whether there is anything besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or all things are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>6. Augustine said: This I can reply, that the Lord wished me to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God cannot suffer any necessity, nor be violated or corrupted in any part. Which, since you also acknowledge, I ask by what necessity He sent hither <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that you say return through Christ?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: What you have said: that thus far God has revealed to you, that He is incorruptible, as He has also revealed to me; the reason must be sought, how and wherefore <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have come into this world, so that now of right God should liberate them from this world through his Son only begotten and like Himself, if besides Himself there is nothing?</p>

<p>7. Augustine said: We ought not to disappoint those present, being men of note, and from the question proposed for discussion go to another. So we both confess, so we concede to ourselves, that God is incorruptible and inviolable, and could have in no way suffered. From which it follows, that your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is false, which says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He saw desolation and ruin threaten His kingdom, sent forth a power that should do battle with the race of darkness, and that out of this commingling our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are laboring. My argument is brief, and as I suppose, perfectly clear to any one. If God could have suffered nothing from the race of darkness because He is inviolable, without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He sent us hither that we might here suffer distress. But if anything can suffer, it is not inviolable, and you deceive those to whom you say that God is inviolable. For this your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> denies when you expound the rest of it.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: We are of that mind in which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> instructs us, who says: "Let this mind be in you that was also in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who when He had been constituted in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but emptied Himself receiving the form of a servant, having been made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and having been found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He humbled Himself, and was made <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death." <span class="stiki" id="note140228"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse5">Philippians&nbsp;2:5-8</a></span> We have this mind therefore about ourselves, which we have also about Christ, who when He was constituted in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death that He might show the similitude of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And like as He showed in Himself the similitude of death, and having been raised from the midst of the dead showed that He was from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in the same manner we think it will be with our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, because through Him we shall have been able to be freed from this death, which is either alien from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or if it belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His mercy ceases, and the name of liberator, and the works of Him who liberates. </p>

<p>8. Augustine said: I ask how we came into death, and you tell how we may be liberated from death.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: So the apostle said that we ought to have that mind concerning ourselves which Christ has shown us. If Christ was in suffering and death, so also are we.</p>

<p>9. Augustine said: It is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to the effect that our Lord, that is the Power and Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140230"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> and the Word through whom all things have been made and without whom was not anything made, <span class="stiki" id="note140231"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> took upon Himself man to liberate us. In the man whom He took upon Himself, He demonstrated those things that you spoke of. But we now ask concerning the substance of God Himself and of Unspeakable Majesty, whether anything can injure it or not. For if anything can injure it, He is not inviolable. If nothing can injure the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what was the race of darkness about to do to it, against which you say <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was waged by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before the foundation of the world; in which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> you assert that we, that is <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are now manifestly in need of a liberator, have been commingled with every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and implicated in death. For I return to that very brief statement: If He could be injured, He is not inviolable; if He could not, He acted cruelly in sending us hither to suffer these things.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or not?</p>

<p>10. Augustine said: If it is just that you should fail to respond to my questions, and that I should be questioned, I will reply.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> act independently? This I ask of you.</p>

<p>11. Augustine said: I indeed will tell what you have asked; only remember this, that while you have refused to respond to my questions, I have responded to yours. If you ask whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> descended from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is indeed a great question; but whether it descends from God or not, I make this reply concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that it is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that God is one thing, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> another. That God is inviolable, incorruptible, and impenetrable, and incontaminable, who also could be corrupted in no part and to whom no injury can be done in any part. But we see also that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sinful, and is conversant with misery, and seeks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and is in want of a liberator. This changing condition of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shows me that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not God. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the substance of God <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>, the substance of God is corrupted, the substance of God is violated, the substance of God is deceived; which it is impious to say.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Therefore you have denied that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so long as it serves <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and earthly things, and is led by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because it cannot happen that either God or His substance should suffer this thing. For God is incorruptible and His substance immaculate and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. But here it is inquired of you whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or not? Which we confess, and show from the advent of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, from His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> preaching, from His election; while He pitied <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to have come according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that He might free it from death and might bring it to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and restore it to the Father. But what do you say and hope concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; is it from God or not? Can the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from which you deny that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has its being, be subject to no <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>?</p>

<p>12. Augustine said: I have denied that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the sense of its being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but yet I hold that it is from God as its author, because it was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Maker is one thing, the thing made is another. He who made cannot be corruptible at all, but what He made cannot be at all equal to Him who made it.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Nor have I said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is like God. But because you have said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is an artificial thing, and that there is nothing besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I ask whence then God invented the substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</p>

<p>13. Augustine said: Only bear in mind that I reply to your interrogations, but that you do not reply to mine. I say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as all other things that were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that among the things that God Almighty made the principal place was given to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But if you ask whence God made the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, remember that you and I agree in confessing that God is almighty. But he is not almighty who seeks the assistance of any material whence he may make what he will. From which it follows, that according to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, all things that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made through His Word and Wisdom, He made out of nothing. For so we read: "He ordered and they were made; He commanded and they were created." </p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Do all things have their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from God's command?</p>

<p>14. Augustine said: So I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but all things which were made.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: As things made they agree, but because they are unsuitable to themselves, therefore on this account it follows, that there is not one substance, although from the same order of the One they came to the composition and fashioning of this world. But it is plain in the things themselves that there is no similarity between darkness and light, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, death and life, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and other similar things which differ from each other both in names and appearances. And for good reason did our Lord say: "The tree which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up and cast into the fire, because it brings not forth good fruit:"  and that the tree has been rooted up. Hence <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> it follows from the reason of things that there are two substances in this world which agree in forms and in names, of which one belongs to corporeal natures, but the other is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> substance of the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> Father, which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be God's substance.</p>

<p>15. Augustine said: Those contrary things that move you so that we think adversely, have happened on account of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is, on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of man. For God made all things good, and ordered them well; but He did not make <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and our <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the only thing that is called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. There is another kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which is the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since therefore there are two kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pertains to the avenger. For as God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> who constituted all things, so He is just in taking vengeance on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since therefore all things are ordered in the best possible way, which seem to us now to be adverse, it has deservedly happened to fallen man who was unwilling to keep the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For God gave <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is in man. For thus it would have been possible to have merit, if we should be good voluntarily and not of necessity. Since therefore it behooves us to be good not of necessity but voluntarily, it behooved God to give to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. But to this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, He subjected all things without adversity, so that the rest of the things that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made should serve it, if also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself had willed to serve God. But if it should refuse to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, those things that served it should be converted into its punishment. Wherefore if all things are rightly ordered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are good, neither does God suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: He does not suffer, but prevents <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>16. Augustine said: From whom then was He about to suffer it?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: This is my point, that He wished to prevent it, not rashly, but by power and prescience. But deny <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be apart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when other precepts can be shown which are done apart from His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. A precept is not introduced, unless where there is contrariety. The free faculty of living  is not given except where there is a fall according to the argument of the apostle who says: "And you did he quicken, when you were dead in your trespasses and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherein aforetime ye walked according to the rulership of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that now works in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of disobedience; among whom we also all once lived in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of our flesh, doing the desires of the counsels of the flesh, and were by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, even as the rest: but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is rich in all mercy, had mercy on us. And when we were dead by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, quickened us together in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you have been saved; and at the same time also raised us up, and made us to sit with Him in the heavenly places with Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in kindness toward us in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. For by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> have you been saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and that not of yourselves, for it is a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not of works, lest any one should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus in good works, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> prepared that we should walk in them. Wherefore remember, that aforetime you were <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision, by that which is called <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> in flesh made by hands, because you were at that time without Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and strangers of the covenant, having no <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, and without God in this world. But now in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, you that once were far off are made near in the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For He is our peace, who made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in His flesh, making void by His decrees the law of commandments, that in Himself He might unite the two into one new man, making peace, that He might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, slaying the enmities in Himself. And He came and preached peace unto you that were far off, and peace to them that were near. For through Him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father." </p>

<p>17. Augustine said: This passage from the apostle, which you have thought fit to recite, if I mistake not, makes very strongly for my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and against yours. In the first place, because <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> itself, on which I have said that the possibility of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> sinning depends, is here sufficiently expressed, when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are mentioned, and it is said that our reconciliation with God takes place through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For by sinning we were brought into opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but by holding to the precepts of Christ we are reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that we who were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be made alive by keeping His precepts, and may have peace with Him in one Spirit, from whom we were alienated, by failure to keep His precepts; as is set forth in our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> concerning the man who was first created. I ask of you, therefore, according to that passage which has been read, how can we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if contrary nature compels us to do what we do? For he who is compelled by nature to do anything, does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Wherefore would repentance be enjoined upon us, if we have done nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but only the race of darkness? Likewise, I ask, to whom is forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> granted, to us or to the race of darkness? If to the race of darkness, their race will also reign with Him, receiving the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but if to us it is manifest that we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> voluntarily. For it is the height of folly for him to be pardoned who has done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But he has done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who has done nothing of his own will. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that today promises itself forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and reconciliation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if it should cease to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and repent of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: if it should answer according to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and should say: In what have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? In what am I guilty? Why have You expelled me from Your domains, that I might do battle with some sort of race? I have been trodden under foot, I have been mixed up, I have been corrupted, I am worn out,  my <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> has not been preserved. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the necessity by which I am preserved: Why dost Thou impute to me the wounds that I have received? Why do You compel me to repentance when You are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of my wounds; when You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I have suffered, what the race of darkness has done against me, Thou being the author who could suffer no harm and yet wishing to save the domains which nothing could injure, You thrusted me down into these miseries. If indeed I am a part of You, who have proceeded from Your bowels, if I am from Your kingdom and Your mouth, I ought not to suffer anything in this race of darkness, so that I being uncorrupted that race should be subjected, if I was a part of the Lord. But now since it cannot be controlled except by my corruption, how can I either be said to be a part of You, or Thou remain inviolable, or not be cruel in wishing me to suffer for those domains, that could in no way be injured by that race of darkness? Respond to this if you please, and deign also to explain to me how it was said by the apostle, "We were by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>," who, he says, have been reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If therefore they were by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, how do you say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is by nature a daughter and portion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: If with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the apostle had said that we are by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would have been alienated by the mouth of the apostle from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From this argument you only show that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because, the apostle says, "We are by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>." But if it is said in view of the fact that the apostle <span class="stiki" id="note140236"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;11:1</a></span> was held by the law, descending as he himself testifies, from the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, it follows that he has said corporeally, that we [<em>i.e.</em>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>] were children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> even as the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. But he shows that the substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot otherwise be reconciled to God than through the Master, who is Christ Jesus. For the enmity having been slain, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> seemed to God unworthy to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. But that it was sent, this we confess, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> yet <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, both deriving its origin from Him and sent for the sealing of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. In the same way we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also that Christ the Saviour came from heaven to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father. Which will of the Father was this, to free our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from the same enmity, this enmity having been slain, which if it had not been opposed to God could neither be called enmity where there was unity, nor could slaying be spoken of or take place where there was life.</p>

<p>18. Augustine said: Remember that the apostle said that we are alienated from God by our manner of life.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: I submit, that there were two substances. In the substance of light, as we have above said, God is to be held incorruptible; but that there was a contrary nature of darkness, that which I also today confess is vanquished by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that Christ has been sent forth as a Saviour for my restoration, as previously the same apostle says.</p>

<p>19. Augustine said: That we should discuss on rational grounds the belief in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, has been made obligatory by those who are hearing us. But inasmuch as you have again betaken yourself to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, I descend to them, and demand that nothing be passed by, lest using certain statements we should bring confusion into the minds of those to whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are not well known. Let us therefore consider a statement that the apostle has in his epistle to the Romans. For on the first page is what is strongly against you. For he says: "<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, called to be an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, separated unto the gospel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which He promised aforetime by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, concerning his Son, who was made unto Him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power, according to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> from the resurrection from the dead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140237"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;1:1-4</a></span> We see that the apostle teaches us concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> that before the flesh he was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and according to the flesh was made unto Him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. Since you have always denied and always will deny this, how do you so earnestly demand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that we should discuss rather according to them.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: You assert that according to the flesh Christ was of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, when it should be asserted that he was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note140238"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> and should be magnified as <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For this cannot be, unless as what is from spirit may be held to be spirit, so also what is from flesh may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be flesh. <span class="stiki" id="note140239"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;3:6</a></span> Against which is the authority of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in which it is said, that "flesh and blood shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, neither shall corruption inherit incorruption." <span class="stiki" id="note140240"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse50">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:50</a></span> </p>

<p>Here a clamor was made by the audience who wished the argument to be conducted on rational grounds, because they saw that Fortunatus was not willing to receive all things that are written in the <em>Codex</em> of the apostle. Then little discussions began to be held here and there by all, until Fortunatus said that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> has been fettered in the race of darkness. At which, when those present had expressed their horror, the meeting was closed. </p>

<h2>Disputation of the Second Day</h2>

<p>The next day, a notary having again been summoned, the discussion was conducted as follows:</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: I say that God Almighty brings forth from Himself nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that the things that are His remain incorrupt, having sprung and being born from an inviolable source; but other contrary things which have their being in this world, do not flow from God nor have appeared in this world with God as their author; that is to say, they do not derive their origin from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These things therefore we have received in the belief that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things are foreign to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>20. Augustine said: And our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is this, that God is not the progenitor of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, neither has He made any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nature. But since both of us agree that God is incorruptible and incontaminable, it is the part of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and faithful to consider, which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is purer and worthier of the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that in which it is asserted that either the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or some part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, can be changed, violated, corrupted, fettered; or that in which it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and His entire nature and substance can never be corrupted in any part, but that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> have their being by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Which <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> if God had not given, there could be no just penal judgment, nor merit of righteous conduct, nor divine instruction to repent of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> itself which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has bestowed upon us through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Because he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not voluntarily, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not at all. This I suppose to be open and perspicuous to all. Wherefore it ought not to trouble us if according to our deserts we suffer some inconveniences in the things God has made. For as He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, that He should constitute all things; so He is just, that He may not spare <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as I have said, unless <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> were in us, would not be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For if any one, so to speak, should be bound by some one in his other members, and with his hand something false should be written without his own will, I ask whether if this were laid open before a judge, he could condemn this one for the crime of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Wherefore, if it is manifest that there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> where there is not free exercise of will,  I wish to hear what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which you call either part, or power, or word, or something else, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has done, that it should be punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or repent of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or merit forgiveness, since it has in no way <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: I proposed concerning substances, that God is to be regarded as creator only of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, but as the avenger of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, for the reason that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things are not of Him. Therefore for good reason I think this, and that God avenges <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things because they are not of Himself. But if they were from Him, either He would give them license to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as you say that God has given <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, He would be already found a participator in my fault, because He would be the author of my fault; or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> what I should be, he left me whom he did not constitute worthy of Himself. This therefore is proposed by me, and what I ask now is, whether God instituted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or not? And whether He Himself instituted the end of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For it appears from these things, and the evangelical <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> teaches, that the things which we have said were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself as God the Creator, as having been created and begotten by Him, are to be esteemed incorruptible. These things I also proposed which belong to our belief, and which can be confirmed by you in that profession of ours, without prejudice to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And because I can in no way show that I rightly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, unless I should confirm that belief by the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, this is therefore what I have insinuated, what I have said. Either if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things have appeared in the world with God as their author, deign to say so yourself; or if it is right to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this also the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of those present ought to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and receive. I have spoken about substances, not about <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwells in us. For if what we think to make faults had no origin, we should not be compelled to come to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or to fault. For because we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> unwillingly, and are compelled by a substance contrary and hostile to ourselves, therefore we follow the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things. By which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> admonished and restored to pristine memory, recognizes the source from which it derives its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, in what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> it dwells, by what good works emending again that in which unwillingly it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, it may be able through the emendation of its faults, for the sake of good works, to secure for itself the merit of reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our Saviour being the author of it, who teaches us also to practice <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things and to flee from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For you ask us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that not by some contrary nature, but by his own choice, man either serves righteousness or becomes involved in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; since, no contrary race existing, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to which as you say God has given <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, having been constituted in the body, dwells alone, it would be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor would it become involved in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>21. Augustine said: I say it is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if it be not committed by one's own will; hence also there is reward, because of our own will we do right. Or if he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> unwillingly deserves punishment, he who unwillingly does well ought to deserve reward. But who doubts that reward is only bestowed upon him who does something of good will? From which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that punishment also is inflicted upon him who does something of ill will. But since you recall me to primordial natures and substances, my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that God Almighty&mdash; which must especially be attended to and fixed in the mind&mdash; that God Almighty has made <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. But the things made by Him cannot be such as is He who made them. For it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and foolish to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that works are equal to the workman, things made to the maker. Wherefore if it is reverential to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, than which nevertheless He is by far more excellent and by far more pre-eminent; the origin and head of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as the apostle said: "Covetousness is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; which some following after have made shipwreck of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows." <span class="stiki" id="note140243"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> For if you seek the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, you have the apostle saying that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But the root of a root I cannot seek. Or if there is another <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whose root <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is not, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> will not be the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, in vain do we seek some other kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But as regards that contrary nature of yours which you introduce, since I have responded to your objections, I ask that you deign to tell me whether it is wholly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whether there can be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> apart from it, whether by this alone punishment is deserved, not by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by which no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been committed. But if you say that this contrary nature alone deserves punishment, and not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I ask to which is repentance, which is commanded, vouchsafed. If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is commanded to repent, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> voluntarily. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is compelled to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that which it does is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Is it not foolish and most absurd to say that the race of darkness has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and that I repent of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Is it not most absurd to say that the race of darkness has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and that forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is vouchsafed to me, who according to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may well say: What have I done? What have I committed? I was with You, I was in a state of integrity, I was contaminated with no pollution. You sent me hither, You suffered necessity, You protected Your domains when great pollution and desolation threatened them. Since therefore You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the necessity by which I have been here oppressed, by reason of which I could not breathe, which I could not resist; why dost Thou accuse me as if sinning? Or why dost Thou promise forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Reply to this without evasion, if you please, as I have replied to you.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: We say this, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is compelled by contrary nature to transgress, for which transgression you maintain there is no root save the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that dwells in us; for it is certain that apart from our bodies <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things dwell in the whole world. For not those things alone that we have in our bodies, dwell in the whole world, and are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their names as good; an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> root also inheres. For your dignity said that this <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> that dwells in our bodies is the root of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; since therefore there is no desire of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> out of our bodies, from that source contrary nature dwells in the whole world. For the apostle designated that, namely <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as the root of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, not one <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which you have called the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But not in one manner is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which you have said is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, understood, as if of that which dwells in our bodies alone; for it is certain that this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which dwells in us descends from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> author and that this root as you call it is a small portion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so that it is not the root itself, but is a small portion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which dwells everywhere. Which root and tree our Lord called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as never bearing good fruit, which his Father did not plant, and which is deservedly rooted up and cast into the fire.  For as you say, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ought to be imputed to the contrary nature, that nature belongs to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and that this is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if after the warning of our Saviour and his wholesome instruction, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall have segregated itself from its contrary and hostile race, adorning itself also with purer things; that otherwise it cannot be restored to its own substance. For it is said: "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But now that I have come and spoken, and they have refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, they shall have no excuse for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140245"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;15:22</a></span> Whence it is perfectly plain, that repentance has been given after the Saviour's advent, and after this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things, by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can, as if washed in a divine fountain from the filth and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> as well of the whole world as of the bodies in which the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dwells, be restored to the kingdom of God whence it has gone forth. For it is said by the apostle, that "the mind of the flesh is hostile to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; is not subject to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither indeed can be." <span class="stiki" id="note140246"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;8:7</a></span> Therefore it is evident from these things that the good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> seems to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not voluntarily, but by the doing of that which is not subject to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it likewise follows that "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh; so that you may not do the things that you will." <span class="stiki" id="note140247"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> Again: "I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive in the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of death. Therefore I am a miserable man; who shall deliver me from the body of this death, unless it be the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note140248"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23-25</a></span> "through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world?" <span class="stiki" id="note140249"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;5:14</a></span> </p>

<p>22. Augustine said: I recognize and embrace the testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, and I will show in a few words, as God may deign to grant, how they are consistent with my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. I say that there was free exercise of will in that man who was first formed. He was so made that absolutely nothing could resist his will, if he had willed to keep the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But after he voluntarily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, we who have descended from his stock were plunged into necessity. But each one of us can by a little consideration find that what I say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For today in our actions before we are implicated by any habit, we have free choice of doing anything or not doing it. But when by that liberty we have done something and the pernicious sweetness and pleasure of that deed has taken hold upon the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by its own habit the mind is so implicated that afterwards it cannot conquer what by sinning it has fashioned for itself. We see many who do not wish to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, but because the tongue has already become habituated, they are not able to prevent those things from going forth from the mouth which we cannot but ascribe to the root of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For that I may discuss with you those words, which as they do not withdraw from your mouth so may they be understood by your heart: you <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the Paraclete. If therefore you wish to find out experimentally whether what I say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, determine not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>. You will see, that that habit is borne along as it has become accustomed to be. And this is what <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, habit formed in the flesh. This is indeed the mind of the flesh, which, as long as it cannot thus be subject to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so long is it the mind of the flesh; but when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been illuminated it ceases to be the mind of the flesh. For thus it is said the mind of the flesh cannot be subject to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as if it were said, that snow cannot be warm. For so long as it is snow, it can in no way be warm. But as the snow is melted by heat, so that it may become warm, so the mind of the flesh, that is, habit formed with the flesh, when our mind has become illuminated, that is, when God has subjected for Himself the whole man to the choice of the divine law, instead of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> habit of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, makes a good habit. Accordingly it is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said by the Lord of the two trees, the one good and the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which you have called to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that they have their own fruits; that is, neither can the good tree yield <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit, nor the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tree good fruit, but so long as it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Let us take two men, a good and a bad. As long as he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> he cannot yield <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit; as long as he is bad he cannot yield good fruit. But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that those two trees are so placed by the Lord, that free choice may be there signified, that these two trees are not natures but our wills, He Himself says in the gospel: "Either make the tree good, or make the tree <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140250"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;12:35</a></span> Who is it that can make nature? If therefore we are commanded to make a tree either good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it is ours to choose what we will. Therefore concerning that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of man and concerning that habit of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> formed with the flesh the apostle says: "Let no one seduce you;" <span class="stiki" id="note140251"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse6">Ephesians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> "Every creature that has been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note140252"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:4</a></span> The same apostle whom you also have cited says: "As through the disobedience of the one the many were constituted sinners; so also through the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the one the many are constituted righteous." <span class="stiki" id="note140253"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;5:19</a></span> "Since through man is death, through man also is resurrection of the dead." As long therefore as we bear the image of the earthly man,  that is, as long as we live according to the flesh, which is also called the old man, we have the necessity  of our habit, so that we may not do what we will. But when the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God has breathed the divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> into us and has made us subject to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, to us it is said: "You are called for freedom," <span class="stiki" id="note140255"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;5:13</a></span> and "the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God has made me free from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of death." <span class="stiki" id="note140256"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;8:2</a></span> But the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is that whoever has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> shall die. From this law we are freed when we have begun to be righteous. The law of death is that by which it was said to man: "Earth you are and into earth you shall go." <span class="stiki" id="note140257"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> For from this very fact we are all so born, because we are earth, and from the fact that we are all so born because we are earth, we shall all go into earth on account of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the first man. But on account of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which frees us from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of death, having been converted to righteousness we are freed; so that afterwards this same flesh tortures us with its punishment so long as we remain in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is subjected to us in resurrection, and shakes us by no adversity from keeping the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His precepts. Whence, since I have replied to your questions, deign to reply as I desire, how it can happen, that if nature is contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be imputed to us, who were sent into that nature not voluntarily, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, whom nothing could injure?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Just as also the Lord said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: "Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves." <span class="stiki" id="note140258"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> Hence it must be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that not with hostile intent did our Saviour send forth His lambs, that is His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, into the midst of wolves, unless there had been some contrariety, which He would indicate by the similitude of wolves, where also He had sent His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which perchance might be deceived in the midst of wolves might be recalled to their proper substance. Hence also may appear the antiquity of our times to which we return, and of our years, that before the foundation of the world <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were sent in this way against the contrary nature, that subjecting the same by their passion, victory might be restored to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the same apostle said, that not only there should be a struggle against flesh and blood, but also against principalities and powers, and the spiritual things of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and the domination of darkness." <span class="stiki" id="note140259"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;5:12</a></span> If therefore in both places <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> dwell and are esteemed wickednesses, not only now is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in our bodies, but in the whole world, where <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> appear to dwell, which dwell beneath yonder heaven and are fettered.</p>

<p>23. Augustine said: The Lord sent His lambs into the midst of wolves, that is, just men into the midst of sinners for the preaching of the gospel received in the time of man from the inestimable divine Wisdom, that He might call us from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to righteousness. But what the apostle says, that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and the other things that have been quoted, this signifies that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as also we, have fallen and lapsed by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and have secured possession of earthly things, that is, sinful men, who, as long as we are sinners, are under their yoke, just as when we shall be righteous, we shall be under the yoke of righteousness; and against them we have a struggle, that passing over to righteousness we may be freed from their dominion. Do you also therefore deign to reply to the one question that I ask: Could God suffer injury, or not? But I ask you to reply: He could not.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: He could not suffer injury.</p>

<p>24. Augustine said: Wherefore then did He send us hither, according to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: My profession is this, that God could not be injured, and that He directed us hither. But since this is contrary to your view, do you tell how you account for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being here, which our God desires to liberate both by His commandments and by His own Son whom He has sent.</p>

<p>25. Augustine said: Since I see that you cannot answer my inquiries, and wish to ask me something, behold I satisfy you, provided only that you bear in mind that you have not replied to my question. Why the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is here in this world involved in miseries has been explained by me not just now, but again and again a little while ago. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and therefore is miserable. It accepted free choice, used free choice, as it willed; it fell, was cast out from blessedness, was implicated in miseries. As bearing upon this I recited to you the testimony of the apostle who says: "As through one man death, so also through one man came the resurrection of the dead." What more do you ask? Hence do you reply, wherefore did He, who could not suffer injury, send us hither?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must be sought, why the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> came hither, or wherefore God desires hence to liberate the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that lives in the midst of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>?</p>

<p>26. Augustine said: This <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I ask of you, that is, if God could not suffer injury, wherefore He sent us hither?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: It is inquired of us, if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot injure <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was sent hither, or for what reason was it mingled with the world? Which is manifest in what the apostle says: "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why have you formed me thus?" <span class="stiki" id="note140260"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20</a></span> If therefore this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must be pleaded, He must be asked, why He sent the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, no necessity compelling Him. But if there was necessity for sending the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of right is there also the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of liberating it.</p>

<p>27. Augustine said: Then God is pressed by necessity, is He?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Now this is it. Do not seek to bring odium upon what has been said because we do not make God subject to necessity, but to have voluntarily sent the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>28. Augustine said: Recall what was said above. And it runs: "But if there was necessity for sending the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of right is there also the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of liberating it. Augustine said: We have heard: But if there was necessity for sending the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of right is there also the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of liberating it." You, therefore, said that there was necessity for sending the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But if you only wish to say "a will to send," I add this also: He who could suffer no injury, had the cruel will to send the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to so great miseries. Because I speak for the sake of refuting this statement, I ask pardon from the mercy of that One in whom we have hope of liberation from all the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: You asseverate that we say that God is cruel in sending the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man, breathed into him a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which assuredly He foreknew to be involved in future misery, and not to be able by reason of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to be restored to its inheritance. This belongs either to one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, or who gives the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> up to these aforesaid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. This I have cited because you said not long since, that God adopted the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not that it is from Him; for to adopt is a different matter.</p>

<p>29. Augustine said: Concerning adoption I remember that I spoke some days ago according to the testimony of the apostle, who says that we have been called into the adoption of sons. <span class="stiki" id="note140261"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;1:5</a></span> This was not my reply, therefore, but the apostle's, concerning which thing, that is, that adoption, we may inquire, if we please, in its own time; and concerning that I will reply without delay, when you shall have answered my objections.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: I say that there was a going forth of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> against a contrary nature, which nature could not injure God.</p>

<p>30. Augustine said: What need was there for that going forth, when God whom nothing could injure had nothing to protect?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Do you conscientiously hold that Christ came from God?</p>

<p>31. Augustine said: Again you are questioning me. Reply to my inquiries.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: So I have received in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God He came hither.</p>

<p>32. Augustine said: And I say: Why did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, inviolable, immutable, whom nothing could injure, send hither the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to miseries, to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, to those things that we suffer?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: For it has been said: "I have power to lay down my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and I have power to take it again." <span class="stiki" id="note140262"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a></span> Now He said that by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> went forth.</p>

<p>33. Augustine said: I ask for the reason why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He can in no way suffer injury, sent the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hither?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: We have already said that God can in no way suffer injury, and we have said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in a contrary nature, therefore that it imposes a limit on the contrary nature. The restraint having been imposed on the contrary nature, God takes the same. For He Himself said, "I have power to lay down my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and power to take it." The Father gave to me the power of laying down my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and of taking it. To what <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, therefore, did God who spoke in the Son refer? Evidently our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is held in these bodies,which came of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is again taken up.</p>

<p>34. Augustine said: Why our Lord said: "I have power to lay down my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and power to take it," is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all; because He was about to suffer and to rise again. But I ask of you again and again, If God could in no way suffer injury, why did he send <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> hither?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: To impose a limit on contrary nature.</p>

<p>35. Augustine said: And did God <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, merciful and supreme, that He might impose a restraint on contrary nature, wish it to be limited so that He might make us unrestrained?</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: But so He calls us back to Himself.</p>

<p>36. Augustine said: If He recalls to Himself from an unrestrained state, if from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, from misery, what need was there for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to suffer so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> through so long a time till the world ends? Since God by whom you say it was sent could in no way suffer injury.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: What then am I to say?</p>

<p>37. Augustine said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you have nothing to say, and that I, when I was among you, never found anything to say on this question, and that I was thus admonished from on high to leave that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and to be converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or rather to recall it, by the indulgence of Him who did not permit me to inhere forever in this fallacy. But if you confess that you have nothing to reply, I will expound the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to all those hearing and investigating, seeing that they are <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, if they permit and wish.</p>

<p>Fortunatus said: Without prejudice to my profession I might say: when I shall have reconsidered with my superiors the things that have been opposed by you, if they fail to respond to this question of mine, which is now in like manner proposed to me by you, it will be in my <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> (since I desire my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be liberated by an assured <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>) to come to the investigation of this thing that you have proposed to me and that you promise you will show.</p>

<p>Augustine said: Thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
