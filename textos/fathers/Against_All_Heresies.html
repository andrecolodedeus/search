<h1>Against All Heresies</h1>


<h2>Chapter 1. Earliest Heretics:  Simon Magus, Menander, Saturninus, Basilides, Nicolaus. [The Work Begins as a Fragment.]</h2>

<p>Of which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> I will (to pass by a good deal) summarize some few particulars. For of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism's</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> I am silent&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus the Samaritan</a>, I mean, who was the first who had the hardihood to repudiate the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, on the ground that they had not spoken under inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> I am silent, who, springing from the root of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, had the hardihood to adjoin to this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> the denial likewise of the resurrection of the flesh.  The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> I pretermit, who were <q>divided</q> from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by their superimposing of certain additaments to the law, which fact likewise made them worthy of receiving this very name;  and, together with them, the Herodians likewise, who said that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was Christ. To those I betake myself who have chosen to make the gospel the starting-point of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.</p>

<p>Of these the first of all is <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, who in the Acts of the Apostles earned a condign and just sentence from the Apostle Peter.  He had the hardihood to call himself the Supreme Virtue,  that is, the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and moreover, (to assert) that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>  had been originated by his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; that he had descended in quest of an erring d&aelig;mon,  which was Wisdom; that, in a phantasmal semblance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he had <em>not</em> suffered among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but was <em>as if he had suffered</em>. </p>

<p>After him Menander, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> (likewise a magician ), saying the same as Simon. Whatever Simon had affirmed himself to be, this did Menander equally affirm himself to be, asserting that none could possibly have <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in his name.</p>

<p>Afterwards, again, followed Saturninus: he, too, affirming that the innascible  Virtue, that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, abides in the highest regions, and that those regions are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and in the regions immediately above us; but that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> far removed from Him made the lower world;  and that, because light from above had flashed refulgently in the lower regions, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had carefully tried to form man after the similitude of that light; that man lay crawling on the surface of the earth; that this light and this higher <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was, thanks to mercy, the salvable spark in man, while all the rest of him perishes;  that Christ had not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in a bodily substance, and had endured a <em>quasi</em>-passion in a phantasmal shape merely; that a resurrection of the flesh there will by no means be.</p>

<p>Afterwards broke out the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>. He affirms that there is a supreme Deity, by name Abraxas,  by whom was created Mind, which in Greek he calls <span class="greek">&#x039D;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C2;</span>; that thence sprang the Word; that of Him issued Providence, Virtue,  and Wisdom; that out of these subsequently were made Principalities, powers,  and Angels; that there ensued <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> issues and processions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; that by these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> 365 heavens were formed, and the world,  in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Abraxas, whose name, if computed, has in itself this number. Now, among the last of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, those who made this world,  he places the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> latest, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the Law and of the Prophets, whom he denies to be a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but affirms to be an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. To him, he says, was allotted the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and accordingly he it was who transferred the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> into the land of Canaan; affirming him to be turbulent above the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and accordingly given to the frequent arousing of seditions and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, yes, and the shedding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood. Christ, moreover, he affirms to have been sent, not by this maker of the world,  but by the above-named Abraxas; and to have come in a phantasm, and been destitute of the substance of flesh: that it was not He who suffered among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but that Simon  was crucified in His stead: whence, again, there must be no believing on him who was crucified, lest one confess to having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Simon. Martyrdoms, he says, are not to be endured. The resurrection of the flesh he strenuously impugns, affirming that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has not been promised to <em>bodies</em>.</p>

<p>A brother <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>  emerged in Nicolaus. He was one of the seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who were appointed in the Acts of the Apostles.  He affirms that Darkness was seized with a concupiscence&mdash; and, indeed, a foul and obscene one&mdash; after Light: out of this permixture it is a shame to say what fetid and unclean (combinations arose). The rest (of his tenets), too, are obscene. For he tells of certain <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, sons of turpitude, and of conjunctions of execrable and obscene embraces and permixtures,  and certain yet baser outcomes of these. He teaches that there were born, moreover, d&aelig;mons, and gods, and spirits seven, and other things sufficiently <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>. alike and foul, which we blush to recount, and at once pass them by. Enough it is for us that this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a> has been condemned by the Apocalypse of the Lord with the weightiest authority attaching to a sentence, in saying <q>Because this you hold, you hate the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a>, which I too <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Ophites, Cainites, Sethites</h2>

<p>To these are added those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> likewise who are called <em>Ophites</em>:  for they magnify the serpent to such a degree, that they prefer him even to Christ Himself; for it was he, they say, who gave us the origin of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.  His power and majesty (they say) <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> perceiving, set up the brazen serpent; and whoever gazed upon him obtained health.  Christ Himself (they say further) in His gospel imitates <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> serpent's sacred power, in saying: <q>And as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> upreared the serpent in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, so it behooves the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> to be upreared.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038357"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;3:14</a></span> Him they introduce to bless their eucharistic (elements).  Now the whole parade and doctrine of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> flowed from the following source. They say that from the supreme primary <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> <em>whom men speak of</em>  there emanated several other inferior <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. To all these, however, there opposed himself an <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> who name is <em>Ialdabaoth</em>.  He had been conceived by the permixture of a second <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> with inferior <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>; and afterwards, when he  had been desirous of forcing his way into the higher regions, had been disabled by the permixture of the gravity of matter with himself to arrive at the higher regions; had been left in the midst, and had extended himself to his full dimensions, and thus had made the sky.  <em>Ialdabaoth</em>, however, had descended lower, and had made him seven sons, and had shut from their view the upper regions by self-distension, in order that, since (these) <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what was above,  they might think him the sole God. These inferior Virtues and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, therefore, had made <em>man</em>; and, because he had been originated by weaker and mediocre powers, he lay crawling, worm-like. That <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, however, out of which <em>Ialdaboath</em> had proceeded, moved to the heart with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, had injected into man as he lay a certain spark; excited whereby, he was through <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to grow wise, and be able to understand the things above. So, again, the <em>Ialdaboath</em> aforesaid, turning indignant, had emitted out of himself the Virtue and similitude of <em>the serpent</em>; and this had been the Virtue in paradise&mdash; that is, this had been the <em>serpent</em>&mdash; whom Eve had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> as if he had been God the Son.  He  plucked, say they, from the fruit of the tree, and thus conferred on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.  Christ, moreover, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not in substance of flesh: <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the flesh is not to be hoped for at all.</p>

<p>Moreover, also, there has broken out another <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> also, which is called that of the <em>Cainites</em>.  And the reason is, that they magnify Cain as if he had been conceived of some potent Virtue which operated in him; for Abel had been procreated after being conceived of an inferior Virtue, and accordingly had been found inferior. They who assert this likewise defend the traitor Judas, telling us that he is admirable and great, because of the advantages he is vaunted to have conferred on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; for some of them think that thanksgiving is to be rendered to Judas on this account: viz., Judas, they say, observing that Christ wished to subvert the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, betrayed Him, in order that there might be no possibility of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> being subverted. And others thus dispute against them, and say: Because the powers of this world  were unwilling that Christ should suffer, lest through His death <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> should be prepared for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, he, consulting for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, betrayed Christ, in order that there might be no possibility at all of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> being impeded, which <em>was</em> being impeded through the Virtues which were opposing Christ's passion; and thus, through the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there might be no possibility of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> being retarded.</p>

<p>But, again, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has started forth which is called that of the <em>Sethites</em>.  The doctrine of this perversity is as follows. Two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings were formed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash; Cain and Abel. On their account arose great contentions and discords among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for this reason, that Virtue which was above all the Virtues&mdash; which they style the Mother&mdash; when they said  that Abel had been slain, willed this Seth of theirs to be conceived and born in place of Abel, in order that those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> might be escheated who had created those two former <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, while this pure seed rises and is born. For they say that there had been iniquitous permixtures of two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings; for which reason that Virtue which (as we have said) they style the Mother brought on the deluge even, for the purpose of vengeance, in order that that seed of permixture might be swept away, and this only seed which was pure be kept entire. But (in vain): for they who had originated those of the former seed sent into the ark (secretly and stealthily, and unknown to that Mother-Virtue), together with those <q>eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>,</q>  the seed likewise of Ham, in order that the seed of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should not perish, but should, together with the rest, be preserved, and after the deluge be restored to the earth, and, by example of the rest, should grow up and diffuse itself, and fill and occupy the whole orb.  Of Christ, moreover, their sentiments are such that they call Him merely Seth, and say that He was instead of the actual Seth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Carpocrates, Cerinthus, Ebion</h2>

<p>Carpocrates, furthermore, introduced the following <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. He affirms that there is one Virtue, the chief among the upper (regions): that out of this were produced <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and Virtues, which, being far distant from the upper Virtues, created this world  in the lower regions: that Christ was not born of <em>the Virgin</em> Mary, but was generated&mdash; a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being&mdash; of the seed of Joseph, superior (they admit) above all others in the practice of righteousness and in integrity of life; that He suffered among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone was received in heaven as having been more firm and hardy than all others: whence he would infer, retaining only the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that there are no resurrections of the body.</p>

<p>After him broke out the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, teaching similarly. For he, too, says that the world  was originated by those <em><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></em>;  and sets forth Christ as born of the seed of Joseph, contending that He was merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, without divinity; affirming also that the Law was given by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>;  representing the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as not the Lord, but an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.</p>

<p>His successor was Ebion,  not agreeing with <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> in every point; in that he affirms the world  to have been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and because it is written, <q>No <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> above <em>his</em> master, nor servant above <em>his</em> lord,</q>  sets forth likewise the law  <em>as binding</em>,  of course for the purpose of excluding the gospel and vindicating <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Valentinus, Ptolemy and Secundus, Heracleon</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, moreover, introduced many fables. These I will retrench and briefly summarize. For he introduces the Pleroma and the thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. These <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, moreover, he explains in the way of syzygies, that is, conjugal unions  of some kind. For among the first,  he says, were Depth  and Silence; of these proceeded Mind and Truth; out of whom burst the Word and Life; from whom, again, were created Man  and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But (these are not all); for of these last also proceeded twelve <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>; from Speech,  moreover, and Life <em>proceeded</em> other ten <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>: such is the Triacontad of <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, which is made up in the Pleroma of an ogdoad, a decad, and a duodecad. The thirtieth <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, moreover, willed to see the great Bythus; and, to see him, had the hardihood to ascend into the upper regions; and not being capable of seeing his magnitude, desponded,  and almost suffered dissolution, had not some one&mdash;he whom he calls Horos, to wit&mdash;sent to invigorate him, strengthened him by pronouncing the word <q>Iao.</q>  This <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, moreover, which was thus reduced to despondency, he calls Achamoth, (and says) that he was seized with certain regretful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and out of his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> gave birth to material essences.  For he was panic-stricken, he says, and terror-stricken, and overcome with sadness; and of these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> he conceived and bare. Hence he made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and whatever is in them: for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> all things made by him are infirm, and frail, and capable of falling, and mortal, inasmuch as he himself was conceived and produced from despondency. He, however, originated this world  out of those material essences which Achamoth, by his panic, or terror, or sadness, or sweat, had supplied. For of his panic, he says, was made darkness; of his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the spirits of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and malignity; of his sadness and tears, the humidities of founts, the material <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of floods and sea. Christ, moreover, was sent by that First-Father who is Bythus. He, moreover, was not in the substance of our flesh; but, bringing down from heaven some spiritual body or other, passed through the Virgin Mary as water through a pipe, neither receiving nor borrowing anything thence. The resurrection of our present flesh he denies, but (maintains that) of some sister-flesh.  Of the Law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> some parts he approves, some he disapproves; that is, he disapproves all in reprobating some. A <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of his own he likewise has, beside these of ours.</p>

<p>After him arose the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> Ptolemy and Secundus, who agree throughout with <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, differing only in the following point: viz., whereas <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> had feigned but thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, they have added several more; for they first added four, and subsequently four more. And Valentine's assertion, that it was the thirtieth <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> which strayed out from the Pleroma, (as <em>falling</em> into despondency,) they deny; for the one which desponded on account of disappointed yearning to see the First-Father was not of the original triacontad, they say.</p>

<p>There arose, besides, Heracleon, a brother -<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, whose sentiments pair with Valentine's; but, by some novelty of terminology, he is desirous of seeming to differ in sentiment. For he introduces the notion that there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> first what he terms (a <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a>);  and then out of that <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a> (arose) two, and then the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. Then he introduces the whole <em>system of</em> Valentine.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Marcus and Colarbasus</h2>

<p>After these there were not wanting a Marcus and a Colarbasus, composing a novel <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> out of the Greek alphabet. For they affirm that without those letters <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot be found; nay more, that in those letters the whole plenitude and perfection of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is comprised; for this was why Christ said, <q>I am the Alpha and the Omega.</q>  In fact, they say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> descended,  that is, that <em>the dove</em> came down on Jesus;  and, since the dove is styled by the Greek name <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;</span> &mdash; (<em>peristera</em>), it has in itself this number DCCCI.  These men run through their <span class="greek">&#x03A9;, &#x03A8;, &#x03A7;, &#x03A6;, &#x03A5;, &#x03A4;</span> &mdash; through the whole alphabet, indeed, up to <span class="greek">&#x0391;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x0392;</span> &mdash; and compute ogdoads and decads. So we may grant it useless and idle to recount all their trifles. What, however, must be allowed not merely vain, but likewise dangerous, is this: they feign a second <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, beside the Creator; they affirm that Christ was not in the substance of flesh; they say there is to be no resurrection of the flesh.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Cerdo, Marcion, Lucan, Apelles</h2>

<p>To this is added one Cerdo. He introduces two first causes,  that is, two Gods&mdash; one good, the other cruel:  the good being the superior; the latter, the cruel one, being the creator of the world.  He repudiates the prophecies and the Law; renounces God the Creator; maintains that Christ who came was the Son of the superior <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; affirms that He was not in the substance of flesh; states Him to have been only in a phantasmal shape, to have not really suffered, but undergone a quasipassion, and not to have been born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, <em>nay</em>, really not to have been born at all. A resurrection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> merely does he approve, denying that of the body. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Luke alone, and that not entire, does he receive. Of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> he takes neither all the epistles, nor in their integrity. The Acts of the Apostles and the Apocalypse he rejects as false.</p>

<p>After him emerged a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of his, one <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> by name, a native of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>,  son of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> because of a rape committed on a certain virgin.  He, starting from the fact that it is said, <q>Every good tree bears good fruit, but an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q>  attempted to approve the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Cerdo; so that his assertions are identical with those of the former <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> before him.</p>

<p>After him arose one Lucan by name, a follower and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. He, too, wading through the same kinds of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, teaches the same as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and Cerdo had taught.</p>

<p>Close on their heels follows <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, who after lapsing, into his own carnality,  was severed from <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. He introduces one God in the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> upper regions, and states that He made many powers and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; beside Him, withal, another Virtue, which he affirms to be called Lord, but represents as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. By him he will have it appear that the world  was originated in imitation of a superior world.  With this <em>lower</em> world he mingled throughout (a principle of) repentance, because he had not made it so perfectly as that superior world had been originated. The Law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> he repudiates. Christ he neither, like <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, affirms to have been in a phantasmal shape, nor yet in substance of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body, as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> teaches; but says, because He descended from the upper regions, that in the course of His descent He wove together for Himself a starry and airy  flesh; and, in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, restored, in the course of His ascent, to the several individual elements whatever had been borrowed in His descent: and thus&mdash; the several parts of His body dispersed&mdash; He reinstated in heaven His spirit only. This man denies the resurrection of the flesh. He uses, too, one only apostle; but that is <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a>, that is, a mutilated one. He teaches the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> alone. He has, besides, private but extraordinary lections of his own, which he calls <q>Manifestations</q>  of one Philumene,  a girl whom he follows as a prophetess. He has, besides, his own books, which he has entitled <em>books</em> of Syllogisms, in which he seeks to prove that whatever <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> has written about God is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but is false.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Tatian, Cataphrygians, Cataproclans, Cat&aelig;schinetans</h2>

<p>To all these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is added one <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, a brother-<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. This man was <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. After Justin's death he began to cherish different opinions from his. For he wholly savours of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>; adding this, that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> cannot even attain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: as if, when the branches become salvable,  the root were not!</p>

<p>Other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> swell the list who are called Cataphrygians, but their teaching is not uniform. For there are (of them) <em>some</em> who are called Cataproclans;  there are others who are termed Cat&aelig;schinetans.  These have a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> common, and a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> not common, but peculiar and special. The common <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> lies in their saying that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> indeed, the Paraclete was not; and in their saying that the Paraclete has spoken in <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> more things than Christ brought forward into (the compass of) the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and not merely more, but likewise better and greater. But the particular one they who follow &AElig;schines have; this, namely, whereby they add this, that they affirm Christ to be Himself Son and Father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Blastus, Two Theodoti, Praxeas</h2>

<p>In addition to all these, there is likewise Blastus, who would latently introduce <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>. For he says the passover is not to be kept otherwise than according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, on the fourteenth of the month. But who would fail to see that evangelical <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is escheated if he recalls Christ to the Law?</p>

<p>Add to these Theodotus the Byzantine, who, after being apprehended for Christ's Name, and apostatizing,  ceased not to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For he introduced a doctrine by which to affirm that Christ was merely a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, but deny His deity; teaching that He was born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> indeed of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but was a solitary and bare <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being,  with no pre-eminence above the rest (of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>), but only that of righteousness.</p>

<p>After him broke out a second <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Theodotus, who again himself introduced a sister-<a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and says that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being Christ Himself  was merely conceived alike, and born, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, but that He was inferior to <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>; because it is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>.</q>  For that <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, he says, was a heavenly Virtue of pre-eminent <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; in that Christ acts for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, being made their Deprecator and Advocate: <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a> does so  for heavenly <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and Virtues. For to such a degree, he says, is he better than Christ, that he is <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;</span> (fatherless), <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BC;&#x1F75;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;</span> (motherless), <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> (without genealogy), of whom neither the beginning nor the end has been comprehended, nor can be comprehended. </p>

<p>But after all these, again, one Praxeas introduced a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which Victorinus  was careful to corroborate. He asserts that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty. Him he contends to have been crucified, and suffered, and died; beside which, with a profane and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> temerity, he maintains the proposition that He is Himself sitting at His own right hand. </p>
