<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 1)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The apostles did not commence to preach the Gospel, or to place anything on record until they were endowed with the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit. They preached one God alone, Maker of heaven and earth.</span>

<p>1. We have learned from none others the plan of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, than from those through whom the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has come down to us, which they did at one time proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, handed down to us in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, to be the ground and pillar of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before they possessed <q>perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> as some do even venture to say, boasting themselves as improvers of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For, after our Lord rose from the dead, [the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>] were invested with power from on high when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came down [upon them], were filled from all [His gifts], and had perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: they departed to the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things [sent] from God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who indeed do all equally and individually possess the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Matthew also issued a written <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> among the Hebrews  in their own dialect, while Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were preaching at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and laying the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After their departure, Mark, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter. Luke also, the companion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, recorded in a book the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> preached by him. Afterwards, John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> during his residence at <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> in Asia.</p>

<p>2. These have all declared to us that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, Creator of heaven and earth, announced  by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and one Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. If any one do not agree to these truths, he despises the companions of the Lord; nay more, he despises Christ Himself the Lord; yea, he despises the Father also, and stands self-condemned, resisting and opposing his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as is the case with all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>
