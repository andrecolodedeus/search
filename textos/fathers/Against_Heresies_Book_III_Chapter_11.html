<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 11)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Proofs in continuation, extracted from St. John's Gospel. The Gospels are four in number, neither more nor less. Mystic reasons for this.</span>

<p>1. John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord, preaches this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and seeks, by the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, to remove that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which by <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> had been disseminated among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and a long time previously by those termed <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a>, who are an offset of that <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, that he might confound them, and persuade them that there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made all things by His Word; and not, as they allege, that the Creator was one, but the Father of the Lord another; and that the Son of the Creator was, forsooth, one, but the Christ from above another, who also continued impassible, descending upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Son of the Creator, and flew back again into His Pleroma; and that Monogenes was the beginning, but <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son of Monogenes; and that this creation to which we belong was not made by the primary <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by some power lying far below Him, and shut off from communion with the things invisible and ineffable. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord therefore desiring to put an end to all such doctrines, and to establish the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that there is one Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made all things by His Word, both visible and invisible; showing at the same time, that by the Word, through whom God made the creation, He also bestowed <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on the men included in the creation; thus commenced His teaching in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.  What was made was life in Him, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013430"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> <q>All things,</q> he says, <q>were made by Him;</q> therefore in <q>all things</q> this creation of ours is [included], for we cannot concede to these men that [the words] <q>all things</q> are spoken in reference to those within their Pleroma. For if their Pleroma do indeed contain these, this creation, as being such, is not outside, as I have demonstrated in the preceding book;  but if they are outside the Pleroma, which indeed appeared impossible, it follows, in that case, that their Pleroma cannot be <q>all things:</q> therefore this vast creation is not outside [the Pleroma].</p>

<p>2. John, however, does himself put this matter beyond all controversy on our part, when he says, <q>He was in this world, and the world was made by Him, and the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not. He came unto His own [things], and His own [people] received Him not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013432"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;1:10-11</a></span> But according to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and those like him, neither was the world made by Him; nor did He come to His own things, but to those of another. And, according to certain of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, this world was made by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and not by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. But according to the followers of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, the world was not made by Him, but by the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>. For he (Soter) caused such similitudes to be made, after the pattern of things above, as they allege; but the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> accomplished the work of creation. For they say that he, the Lord and Creator of the plan of creation, by whom they hold that this world was made, was produced from the Mother; while the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> affirms plainly, that by the Word, which was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all things were made, which Word, he says, <q>was made flesh, and dwelt among us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013433"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> </p>

<p>3. But, according to these men, neither was the Word made flesh, nor Christ, nor the Saviour (Soter), who was produced from [the joint contributions  of] all [the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>]. For they will have it, that the Word and Christ never came into this world; that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, too, never became incarnate, nor suffered, but that He descended like a dove upon the dispensational Jesus; and that, as soon as He had declared the unknown Father, He did again ascend into the Pleroma. Some, however, make the assertion, that this dispensational Jesus did become incarnate, and suffered, whom they represent as having passed through Mary just as water through a tube; but others allege him to be the Son of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, upon whom the dispensational Jesus descended; while others, again, say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born from <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and that the Christ from above descended upon him, being without flesh, and impassible. But according to the opinion of no one of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> made flesh. For if anyone carefully examines the systems of them all, he will find that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is brought in by all of them as not having become incarnate (<em>sine carne</em>) and impassible, as is also the Christ from above. Others consider Him to have been manifested as a transfigured man; but they maintain Him to have been neither born nor to have become incarnate; while others [hold] that He did not assume a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form at all, but that, as a dove, He did descend upon that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who was born from Mary. Therefore the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, pointing them all out as false witnesses, says, <q>And the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013434"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> </p>

<p>4. And that we may not have to ask, Of what God was the Word made flesh? He does himself previously teach us, saying, <q>There was a man sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose name was John. The same came as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that he might bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of that Light. He was not that Light, but [came] that he might testify of the Light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013435"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;1:6</a></span> By what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, was John, the forerunner, who testifies of the Light, sent [into the world]? Truly it was by Him, of whom Gabriel is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who also announced the glad tidings of his birth: [that God] who also had promised by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that He would send His messenger before the face of His Son, <span class="stiki" id="note013436"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse1">Malachi&nbsp;3:1</a></span> who should prepare His way, that is, that he should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of that Light in the spirit and power of Elias. <span class="stiki" id="note013437"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;1:17</a></span> But, again, of what God was Elias the servant and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? Of Him who made heaven and earth,  as he does himself confess. John, therefore, having been sent by the founder and maker of this world, how could he testify of that Light, which came down from things unspeakable and invisible? For all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have decided that the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of that Power above him, whose <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and herald John is found to be. Wherefore the Lord said that He deemed him <q>more than a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013439"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;11:9</a>; <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;7:26</a></span> For all the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> preached the advent of the paternal Light, and desired to be worthy of seeing Him whom they preached; but John did both announce [the advent] beforehand, in a like manner as did the others, and actually saw Him when He came, and pointed Him out, and persuaded many to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, so that he did himself hold the place of both <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and apostle. For this is to be more than a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, because, <q>first <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, secondarily <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013440"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:28</a></span> but all things from one and the same God Himself.</p>

<p>5. That wine,  which was produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a vineyard, and which was first consumed, was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. None <span class="stiki" id="note013442"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;2:3</a></span> of those who drank of it found fault with it; and the Lord partook of it also. But that wine was better which the Word made from water, on the moment, and simply for the use of those who had been called to the marriage. For although the Lord had the power to supply wine to those feasting, independently of any created substance, and to fill with food those who were hungry, He did not adopt this course; but, taking the loaves which the earth had produced, and giving thanks, <span class="stiki" id="note013443"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;6:11</a></span> and on the other occasion making water wine, He satisfied those who were reclining [at table], and gave drink to those who had been invited to the marriage; showing that the God who made the earth, and commanded it to bring forth fruit, who established the waters, and brought forth the fountains, was He who in these last times bestowed upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, by His Son, the blessing of food and the favour of drink: the Incomprehensible [acting thus] by means of the comprehensible, and the Invisible by the visible; since there is none beyond Him, but He exists in the bosom of the Father.</p>

<p>6. For <q>no man,</q> he says, <q>has seen God at any time,</q> unless <q>the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has declared [Him].</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013444"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> For He, the Son who is in His bosom, declares to all the Father who is invisible. Wherefore <em>they</em> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him to whom the Son reveals Him; and again, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by means of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, gives <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His Son to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. By whom also Nathanael, being taught, recognised [Him], he to whom also the Lord bore witness, that he was <q>an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013445"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse47">John&nbsp;1:47</a></span> The  Israelite recognised his King, therefore did he cry out to Him, <q>Rabbi, You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, You are the King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> By whom also Peter, having been taught, recognised Christ as the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when [God] said, <q>Behold My dearly beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall show judgment to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, until He send forth judgment into contention;  and in His name shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> trust.</q> </p>

<p>7. Such, then, are the first principles of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, the Maker of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; He who was also announced by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and who by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> set forth the dispensation of the law,&mdash; [principles] which proclaim the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and ignore any other God or Father except Him. So firm is the ground upon which these <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> rest, that the very <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> themselves bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to them, and, starting from these [documents], each one of them endeavours to establish his own peculiar doctrine. For the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, who use Matthew's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>  only, are confuted out of this very same, making false suppositions with regard to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, mutilating that according to Luke, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be a blasphemer of the only existing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from those [passages] which he still retains. Those, again, who separate Jesus from Christ, alleging that Christ remained impassible, but that it was Jesus who suffered, preferring the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by Mark, if they read it with a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, may have their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> rectified. Those, moreover, who follow <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, making copious use of that according to John, to illustrate their conjunctions, shall be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be totally in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by means of this very <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as I have shown in the first book. Since, then, our opponents do bear testimony to us, and make use of these [documents], our <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> derived from them is firm and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<p>8. It is not possible that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds,  while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is scattered throughout all the world, and the <q>pillar and ground</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013450"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:15</a></span> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing out <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> on every side, and vivifying men afresh. From which fact, it is evident that the Word, the Artificer of all, He that sits upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and contains all things, He who was manifested to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, has given us the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> under four aspects, but bound together by one Spirit. As also David says, when entreating His manifestation, <q>You that sits between the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, shine forth.</q>  For the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, too, were four-faced, and their faces were images of the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For, [as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>] says, <q>The first living creature was like a lion,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013452"><a href="../bible/rev004.htm#verse7">Revelation&nbsp;4:7</a></span> symbolizing His effectual working, His leadership, and royal power; the second [living creature] was like a calf, signifying [His] sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but <q>the third had, as it were, the face as of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q>&mdash; an evident description of His advent as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being; <q>the fourth was like a flying eagle,</q> pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering with His wings over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> are in accord with these things, among which Christ Jesus is seated. For that according to John relates His original, effectual, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> generation from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, thus declaring, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013453"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Also, <q>all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.</q> For this reason, too, is that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> full of all confidence, for such is His person.  But that according to Luke, taking up [His] <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> character, commenced with Zacharias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For now was made ready the fatted calf, about to be immolated for  the finding again of the younger son. Matthew, again, relates His generation as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, saying, <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>;</q>  and also, <q>The birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was on this wise.</q> This, then, is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of His humanity;  for which reason it is, too, that [the character of] a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and meek man is kept up through the whole <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Mark, on the other hand, commences with [a reference to] the prophetical spirit coming down from on high to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, saying, <q>The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as it is written in Esaias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,</q>&mdash; pointing to the winged aspect of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; and on this account he made a compendious and cursory narrative, for such is the prophetical character. And the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Himself used to converse with the ante-Mosaic patriarchs, in accordance with His divinity  and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but for those under the law he instituted a sacerdotal and liturgical service.  Afterwards, being made man for us, He sent the gift of the celestial Spirit over all the earth, protecting us with His wings. Such, then, as was the course followed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, so was also the form of the living creatures; and such as was the form of the living creatures, so was also the character of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.  For the living creatures are quadriform, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is quadriform, as is also the course followed by the Lord. For this reason were four principal (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;</span>) covenants given to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>:  one, prior to the deluge, under Adam; the second, that after the deluge, under <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>; the third, the giving of the law, under <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; the fourth, that which renovates man, and sums up all things in itself by means of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, raising and bearing men upon its wings into the heavenly kingdom.</p>

<p>9. These things being so, all who destroy the form of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> are vain, unlearned, and also audacious; those, [I mean,] who represent the aspects of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> as being either more in number than as aforesaid, or, on the other hand, fewer. The former class [do so], that they may seem to have discovered more than is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; the latter, that they may set the dispensations of God aside. For <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, rejecting the entire <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, yea rather, cutting himself off from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, boasts that he has part in the [blessings of] the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.  Others, again (the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>), that they may set at nought the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which in the latter times has been, by the good pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, poured out upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, do not admit that <em>aspect</em> [of the evangelical dispensation] presented by John's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in which the Lord promised that He would send the Paraclete; <span class="stiki" id="note013462"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> but set aside at once both the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the prophetic Spirit. Wretched men indeed! Who wish to be pseudo-prophets, forsooth, but who set aside the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; acting like those (the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratit&aelig;</a>)  who, on account of such as come in hypocrisy, hold themselves aloof from the communion of the brethren. We must conclude, moreover, that these men (the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>) can not admit the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> either. For, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, <span class="stiki" id="note013464"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:4-5</a></span> he speaks expressly of prophetical gifts, and recognises men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> prophesying in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Sinning, therefore, in all these particulars, against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note013465"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;12:31</a></span> they fall into the irremissible <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But those who are from <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, being, on the other hand, altogether reckless, while they put forth their own compositions, boast that they possess more <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> than there really are. Indeed, they have arrived at such a pitch of audacity, as to entitle their comparatively recent writing <q>the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Truth,</q> though it agrees in nothing with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> of the Apostles, so that they have really no <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which is not full of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. For if what they have published is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and yet is totally unlike those which have been handed down to us from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, any who please may learn, as is shown from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves, that that which has been handed down from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> can no longer be reckoned the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But that these <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> alone are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and reliable, and admit neither an increase nor diminution of the aforesaid number, I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by so many and such [arguments]. For, since God made all things in due proportion and adaptation, it was fit also that the outward aspect of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> should be well arranged and harmonized. The opinion of those men, therefore, who handed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> down to us, having been investigated, from their very fountainheads, let us proceed also to the remaining <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and inquire into their doctrine with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; then, in due course we shall listen to the very words of the Lord.</p>
