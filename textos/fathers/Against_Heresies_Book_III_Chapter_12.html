<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 12)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Doctrine of the rest of the apostles.</span>

<p>1. The Apostle Peter, therefore, after the resurrection of the Lord, and His assumption into the heavens, being desirous of filling up the number of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and in electing into the place of Judas any substitute who should be chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thus addressed those who were present: <q>Men [and] brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by the mouth of David, spoke before concerning Judas, which was made guide to them that took Jesus. For he was numbered with us: <span class="stiki" id="note013466"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse16">Acts&nbsp;1:16</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> ... Let his habitation be desolate,  and let no man dwell therein;  and, His bishoprick let another take;</q> &mdash; thus leading to the completion of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, according to the words spoken by David. Again, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had descended upon the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they all might prophesy and speak with tongues, and some mocked them, as if drunken with new wine, Peter said that they were not drunken, for it was the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the day; but that this was what had been spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>It shall come to pass in the last days, says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and they shall prophesy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013469"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, who did promise by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, that He would send His Spirit upon the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, was He who did send; and God Himself is announced by Peter as having fulfilled His own promise.</p>

<p>2. For Peter said, <q>You men of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, hear my words; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, a man approved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> among you by powers, and wonders, and signs, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did by Him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: Him, being delivered by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the hands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men you have slain, affixing [to the cross]: whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has raised up, having loosed the pains of death; because it was not possible that he should be holden of them. For David speaks concerning Him,  I foresaw the Lord always before my face; for He is on my right hand, lest I should be moved: therefore did my heart <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and my tongue was glad; moreover also, my flesh shall rest in hope: because You will not leave my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, neither will You give Your Holy One to see corruption.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013471"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;2:22-27</a></span> Then he proceeds to speak confidently to them concerning the patriarch David, that he was dead and buried, and that his sepulchre is with them to this day. He said, <q>But since he was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that God had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to him, that of the fruit of his body one should sit in his throne; foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that He was not left in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, neither did His flesh see corruption. This <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>,</q> he said, <q>has God raised up, of which we all are witnesses: who, being exalted by the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, receiving from the Father the promise of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, has shed forth this gift  which you now see and hear. For David has not ascended into the heavens; but he says himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on My right hand, until I make Your foes Your footstool. Therefore let all the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> assuredly, that God has made that same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013473"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse30">Acts&nbsp;2:30-37</a></span> And when the multitudes exclaimed, <q>What shall we do then?</q> Peter says to them, <q>Repent, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> everyone of you in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and you shall receive the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013474"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse37">Acts&nbsp;2:37-38</a></span> Thus the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not preach another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or another Fulness; nor, that the Christ who suffered and rose again was one, while he who flew off on high was another, and remained impassible; but that there was one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and Christ Jesus who rose from the dead; and they preached <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, to those who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and exhorted them out of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that the Christ whom God promised to send, He sent in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom they crucified and God raised up.</p>

<p>3. Again, when Peter, accompanied by John, had looked upon the man lame from his birth, before that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, sitting and seeking <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, he said to him, <q>Silver and gold I have none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a>, rise up and walk. And immediately his legs and his feet received strength; and he walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013475"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts&nbsp;3:6</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Then, when a multitude had gathered around them from all quarters because of this unexpected deed, Peter addressed them: <q>You men of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, why do you marvel at this; or why do you look so earnestly on us, as though by our own power we had made this man to walk? The God of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> His Son, whom you delivered up for judgment,  and denied in the presence of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, when he wished to let Him go. But you were bitterly set against  the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; but you killed the Prince of life, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses. And in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His name, him, whom you see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, has His name made strong; yea, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is by Him, has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. And now, brethren, I know that through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> you did this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.  ... But those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before had showed by the mouth of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that His Christ should suffer, He has so fulfilled. Repent therefore, and be converted, that your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be blotted out, and that  the times of refreshing  may come to you from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, prepared for you beforehand,  whom the heaven must indeed receive until the times of the arrangement  of all things, of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has spoken by His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said unto our fathers, Your Lord God shall raise up to you a Prophet from your brethren, like me; Him shall you hear in all things whatsoever He shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whosoever will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. And all [the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>] from Samuel, and henceforth, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. You are the children of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and of the covenant which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made with our fathers, saying unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you first, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having raised up His Son, sent Him blessing you, that each may turn himself from his iniquities.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013482"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse12">Acts&nbsp;3:12</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Peter, together with John, preached to them this plain message of glad tidings, that the promise which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made to the fathers had been fulfilled by Jesus; not certainly proclaiming another god, but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who also was made man, and suffered; thus leading <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> into <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and through Jesus preaching the resurrection of the dead, <span class="stiki" id="note013483"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;4:2</a></span> and showing, that whatever the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had proclaimed as to the suffering of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, these had God fulfilled.</p>

<p>4. For this reason, too, when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were assembled, Peter, full of boldness, said to them, <q>You rulers of the people, and elders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, if we this day be examined by you of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he has been made whole; be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you all, and to all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a>, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by Him does this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which has become the head-stone of the corner. [Neither is there <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in any other: for] there is none other name under heaven, which is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whereby we must be saved:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013484"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;4:8</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Thus the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not change <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but preached to the people that Christ was Jesus the crucified One, whom the same God that had sent the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, being God Himself, raised up, and gave in Him <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to men.</p>

<p>5. They were confounded, therefore, both by this instance of healing (<q>for the man was above forty years old on whom this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of healing took place</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013485"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;4:22</a></span>), and by the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and by the exposition of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had sent away Peter and John. [These latter] returned to the rest of their fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord, that is, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and related what had occurred, and how courageously they had acted in the name of Jesus. The whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is then said, <q>when they had heard that, lifted up the voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who   has  made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; who, through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,  by the mouth of our father David, Your servant, has  said, Why did the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rage, and the people <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ. For of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in this city,  against Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom You have anointed, both <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, were gathered together, to do whatsoever Your hand and Your counsel determined before to be done.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013488"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse24">Acts&nbsp;4:24</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> These [are the] voices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from which every <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had its origin; these are the voices of the metropolis of the citizens of the new covenant; these are the voices of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; these are voices of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> perfect, who, after the assumption of the Lord, were perfected by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and called upon the God who made heaven, and earth, and the sea&mdash;who was announced by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash;and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> His Son, whom God anointed, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no other [God]. For at that time and place there was neither <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, nor the rest of these subverters [of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>], and their adherents. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Maker of all things, heard them. For it is said, <q>The place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and they spoke the word of God with boldness</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013489"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse31">Acts&nbsp;4:31</a></span> to every one that was willing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.  <q>And with great power,</q> it is added, <q>gave the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the resurrection of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013491"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse33">Acts&nbsp;4:33</a></span> saying to them, <q>The God of our fathers raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom you seized and slew, hanging [Him] upon a beam of wood: Him has God raised up by His right hand  to be a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and  forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And we are in this witnesses of these words; as also is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013493"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse30">Acts&nbsp;5:30</a></span> <q>And daily,</q> it is said, <q>in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not to teach and preach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013494"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse42">Acts&nbsp;5:42</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For this was the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which renders those who acknowledge His Son's advent perfect towards God.</p>

<p>6. But as some of these men impudently assert that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, when preaching among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, could not declare to them another god besides Him in whom they (their hearers ) <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, we say to them, that if the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> used to speak to people in accordance with the opinion instilled into them of old, no one learned the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from them, nor, at a much earlier date, from the Lord; for they say that He did Himself speak after the same fashion. Wherefore neither do these men themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but since such was their opinion regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they had just received doctrine as they were able to hear it. According to this manner of speaking, therefore, the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be with nobody; but all learners will ascribe this practice to all [teachers], that just as every person thought, and as far as his capability extended, so was also the language addressed to him. But the advent of the Lord will appear superfluous and useless, if He did indeed come intending to tolerate and to preserve each man's idea regarding God rooted in him from of old. Besides this, also, it was a much heavier task, that He whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had seen as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and had fastened to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, should be preached as Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> King. Since this, however, was so, they certainly did not speak to them in accordance with their old belief. For they, who told them to their face that they were the slayers of the Lord, would themselves also much more boldly preach that Father who is above the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and not what each individual bid himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> [respecting God]; and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was much less, if indeed they had not fastened to the cross the superior Saviour (to whom it behooved them to ascend), since He was impassible. For, as they did not speak to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in compliance with their notions, but told them with boldness that their gods were no gods, but the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; so would they in like manner have preached to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> another greater or more perfect Father, not nourishing nor strengthening the untrue opinion of these men regarding God. Moreover, while destroying the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and bearing them away from their gods, they did not certainly induce another <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> upon them; but, removing those which were no gods, they pointed out Him who alone was God and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Father.</p>

<p>7. From the words of Peter, therefore, which he addressed in C&aelig;sarea to Cornelius the centurion, and those <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> with him, to whom the word of God was first preached, we can understand what the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> used to preach, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their preaching, and their idea with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this Cornelius was, it is said, <q>a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, giving much <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the people, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to God always. He saw therefore, about the ninth hour of the day, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of God coming in to him, and saying, Your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> have come up for a memorial before God. Wherefore send to Simon, who is called Peter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013496"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;10:1-5</a></span> But when Peter saw the vision, in which the voice from heaven said to him, <q>What God has cleansed, call not common,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013497"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;10:15</a></span> this happened [to teach him] that the God who had, through the law, distinguished between clean and unclean, was He who had purified the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> through the blood of His Son&mdash; He whom also Cornelius worshipped; to whom Peter, coming in, said, <q>Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> I perceive that God is no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: but in every nation, he that fears Him, and works righteousness, is acceptable to Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013498"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse34">Acts&nbsp;10:34-35</a></span> He thus clearly indicates, that He whom Cornelius had previously feared as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom he had heard through the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for whose sake also he used to give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, is, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, God. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Son was, however, wanting to him; therefore did [Peter] add, <q>The word, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, which was published throughout all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, beginning from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which John preached, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, how God anointed Him with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for God was with Him. And we are witnesses of all those things which He did both in the land of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and in Jerusalem; whom they slew, hanging Him on a beam of wood: Him God raised up the third day, and showed Him openly; not to all the people, but unto us, witnesses chosen before of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who ate and drank with Him after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>. And He commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. To Him give all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that, through His name, every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him does receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013499"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse37">Acts&nbsp;10:37-44</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, therefore, did preach the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, of whom men were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; and His advent, to those  who had been already instructed as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but they did not bring in another god. For if Peter had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> any such thing, he would have preached freely to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was indeed one, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> another; and all of them, doubtless, being awe-struck because of the vision of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> whatever he told them. But it is evident from Peter's words that he did indeed still retain the God who was already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them; but he also bore witness to them that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Judge of quick and dead, into whom he did also command them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and not this alone, but he witnessed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who also, having been anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, is called <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. And He is the same being that was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, as the testimony of Peter implies. Can it really be, that Peter was not at that time as yet in possession of the perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which these men discovered afterwards? According to them, therefore, Peter was imperfect, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were imperfect; and so it would be fitting that they, coming to life again, should become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of these men, in order that they too might be made perfect. But this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ridiculous. These men, in fact, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be not <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> notions. To this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also are due the various opinions which exist among them, inasmuch as each one adopted <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> just as he was capable  [of embracing it]. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout all the world, having its origin firm from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, perseveres in one and the same opinion with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>8. But again: Whom did Philip preach to the eunuch of the queen of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, returning from Jerusalem, and reading Esaias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, when he and this man were alone together? Was it not He of whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> spoke: <q>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before the shearer, so He opened not the mouth?</q> <q>But who shall declare His nativity? For His life shall be taken away from the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013501"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;8:32</a>; <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7-8</a></span> [Philip declared] that this was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> was fulfilled in Him; as did also the believing eunuch himself: and, immediately requesting to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013502"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse37">Acts&nbsp;8:37</a></span> This man was also sent into the regions of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, to preach what he had himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that there was one God preached by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but that the Son of this [God] had already made [His] appearance in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (<em>secundum hominem</em>), and had been led as a sheep to the slaughter; and all the other statements which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> made regarding Him.</p>

<p>9. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself also&mdash; after that the Lord spoke to him out of heaven, and showed him that, in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> his own Lord, and sent Ananias to him that he might recover his sight, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>&mdash; <q>preached,</q> it is said, <q>Jesus in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> at Damascus, with all freedom of speech, that this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013503"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse20">Acts&nbsp;9:20</a></span> This is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which he says was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him by revelation, that He who suffered under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, the same is Lord of all, and King, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Judge, receiving power from Him who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, because He became <q><a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even the death of the cross.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013504"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> And inasmuch as this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, when preaching to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> on the Areopagus&mdash; where, no <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> being present, he had it in his power to preach God with freedom of speech&mdash; he said to them: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made the world, and all things therein, He, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands; neither is He touched  by men's hands, as though He needed anything, seeing He gives to all life, and breath, and all things; who has made from one blood the whole race of men to dwell upon the face of the whole earth,  predetermining the times according to the boundary of their habitation, to seek the Deity, if by any means they might be able to track Him out, or find Him, although He be not far from each of us. For in Him we live, and move, and have our being, as certain men of your own have said, For we are also His offspring. Inasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold or silver, or stone graven by art or man's device. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, winking at the times of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, does now command all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> everywhere to turn to Him with repentance; because He has appointed a day, on which the world shall be judged in righteousness by the man Jesus; whereof He has given assurance by raising Him from the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013507"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse24">Acts&nbsp;17:24</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Now in this passage he does not only declare to them God as the Creator of the world, no <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> being present, but that He did also make one race of men to dwell upon all the earth; as also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> declared: <q>When the Most High divided the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, as He scattered the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the nations after the number of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  but  that people which believes in God is not now under the power of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but under the Lord's [rule]. <q>For His people Jacob was made the portion of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> the cord of His inheritance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013509"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:9</a></span> And again, at Lystra of Lycia (Lycaonia), when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was with Barnabas, and in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> had made a man to walk who had been lame from his birth, and when the crowd wished to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them as gods because of the astonishing deed, he said to them: <q>We are men like you, preaching to you <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may be turned away from these vain <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to [serve] the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways, although He left not Himself without <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, performing acts of goodness, giving you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013510"><a href="../bible/act014.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;14:15-17</a></span> But that all his Epistles are consonant to these declarations, I shall, when expounding the apostle, show from the Epistles themselves, in the right place. But while I bring out by these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> the truths of Scripture, and set forth briefly and compendiously things which are stated in various ways, do you also attend to them with patience, and not deem them prolix; taking this into account, that <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> [of the things which are] contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> cannot be shown except from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves.</p>

<p>10. And still further, Stephen, who was chosen the first <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and who, of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, was the first to follow the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the Lord, being the first that was slain for confessing Christ, speaking boldly among the people, and teaching them, says: <q>The God of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> appeared to our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, ... and said to him, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and come into the land which I shall show you; ... and He removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell. And He gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on; yet He promised that He would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him. ... And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and should be brought into bondage, and should be evil-entreated four hundred years; and the nation whom they shall serve will I judge, says the Lord. And after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. And He gave him the covenant of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>: and so [<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>] begot Isaac.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013511"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;7:2-8</a></span> And the rest of his words announce the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was with Joseph and with the patriarchs, and who spoke with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</p>

<p>11. And that the whole range of the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> proclaimed one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who removed <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who made to him the promise of inheritance, who in due season gave to him the covenant of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, who called his descendants out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, preserved outwardly by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>&mdash; for he gave it as a sign, that they might not be like the Egyptians&mdash; that He was the Maker of all things, that He was the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that He was the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash;they who wish may learn from the very words and acts of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and may contemplate the fact that this God is one, above whom is no other. But even if there were another god above Him, we should say, upon [instituting] a comparison of the quantity [of the work done by each], that the latter is superior to the former. For by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> the better man appears, as I have already remarked;  and, inasmuch as these men have no works of their father to adduce, the latter is shown to be God alone. But if any one, <q>doting about questions,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013513"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:4</a></span> do <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that what the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have declared about God should be allegorized, let him consider my previous statements, in which I set forth one God as the Founder and Maker of all things, and destroyed and laid bare their allegations; and he shall find them agreeable to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and so to maintain what they used to teach, and were persuaded of, that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, the Maker of all things. And when he shall have divested his mind of such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and of that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against God which it implies, he will of himself find reason to acknowledge that both the Mosaic law and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the new covenant, as both fitted for the times [at which they were given], were bestowed by one and the same God for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.</p>

<p>12. For all those who are of a perverse <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, having been set against the Mosaic legislation, judging it to be dissimilar and contrary to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, have not applied themselves to investigate the causes of the difference of each covenant. Since, therefore, they have been deserted by the paternal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and puffed up by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, being brought over to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, they have <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> in their opinions from Him who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and imagined that they have themselves discovered more than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, by finding out another god; and [maintained] that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> still somewhat under the influence of Jewish opinions, but that they themselves are purer [in doctrine], and more intelligent, than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and his followers have betaken themselves to mutilating the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, not acknowledging some books  at all; and, curtailing the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke and the Epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, they assert that these are alone authentic, which they have themselves thus shortened. In another work,  however, I shall, God granting [me strength], refute them out of these which they still retain. But all the rest, inflated with the false name of <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> do certainly recognise the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; but they pervert the interpretations, as I have shown in the first book. And, indeed, the followers of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> do directly <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Creator, alleging him to be the creator of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, [but] holding a more tolerable  theory as to his origin, [and] maintaining that there are two beings, gods by nature, differing from each other&mdash;the one being good, but the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Those from <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, however, while they employ names of a more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> kind, and set forth that He who is Creator is both Father, and Lord, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do [nevertheless] render their theory or <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> more <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, by maintaining that He was not produced from any one of those <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> within the Pleroma, but from that defect which had been expelled beyond the Pleroma. Ignorance of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and of the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has brought all these things upon them. And in the course of this work I shall touch upon the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the difference of the covenants on the one hand, and, on the other hand, of their unity and harmony.</p>

<p>13. But that both the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> thus taught as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> preaches, and thus teaching were perfected, wherefore also they were called away to that which is perfect&mdash; Stephen, teaching these truths, when he was yet on earth, saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Jesus on His right hand, and exclaimed, <q>Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013516"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse56">Acts&nbsp;7:56</a></span> These words he said, and was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>; and thus did he fulfil the perfect doctrine, copying in every respect the Leader of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for those who were slaying him, in these words: <q>Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge.</q> Thus were they perfected who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who from beginning to end was present with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in the various dispensations; as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hosea declares: <q>I have filled up visions, and used similitudes by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013517"><a href="../bible/hos012.htm#verse10">Hosea&nbsp;12:10</a></span> Those, therefore, who delivered up their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to death for Christ's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>&mdash; how could they have spoken to men in accordance with old-established opinion? If this had been the course adopted by them, they should not have suffered; but inasmuch as they did preach things contrary to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who did not assent to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for that reason they suffered. It is evident, therefore, that they did not relinquish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but with all boldness preached to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks. To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, indeed, [they proclaimed] that the Jesus who was crucified by them was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Judge of quick and dead, and that He has received from His Father an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as I have pointed out; but to the Greeks they preached one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made all things, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>14. This is shown in a still clearer light from the letter of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, which they forwarded neither to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> nor to the Greeks, but to those who from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, confirming their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For when certain men had come down from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>&mdash; where also, first of all, the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, because of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ&mdash; and sought to persuade those who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the Lord to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and to perform other things after the observance of the law; and when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> had gone up to Jerusalem to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> on account of this question, and the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had convened together, Peter thus addressed them: <q>Men, brethren, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how that from the days of old God made choice among you, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by my mouth should hear the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Searcher of the heart, bore them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, giving them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even as to us; and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now therefore why do you tempt <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to impose a yoke upon the neck of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, we are to be saved, even as they.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013518"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;15:15</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> After him James spoke as follows: <q>Men, brethren, Simon has declared how God did purpose to take from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> a people for His name. And thus  do the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> agree, as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, among whom my name has been invoked, says the Lord, doing these things. <span class="stiki" id="note013520"><a href="../bible/amo009.htm#verse11">Amos&nbsp;9:11-12</a></span> Known from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is His work to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore I for my part give judgment, that we trouble not them who from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are turned to God: but that it be enjoined them, that they  do abstain from the vanities of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from fornication, and from blood; and whatsoever  they wish not to be done to themselves, let them not do to others.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013522"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse14">Acts&nbsp;15:14</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And when these things had been said, and all had given their consent, they wrote to them after this manner: <q>The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, [and] the brethren, unto those brethren from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who are in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Cilicia, greeting: Forasmuch as we have heard that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, saying, You must be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and keep the law; to whom we gave no such commandment: it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; men who have delivered up their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, that they may declare our opinion by word of mouth. For it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; that you abstain from meats offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from fornication; and whatsoever you do not wish to be done to you, do not to others: from which preserving yourselves, you shall do well, walking  in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> From all these passages, then, it is evident that they did not teach the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of another Father, but gave the new covenant of liberty to those who had lately <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in God by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But they clearly indicated, from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the point debated by them, as to whether or not it were still necessary to circumcise the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they had no idea of another god.</p>

<p>15. Neither [in that case] would they have had such a tenor with regard to the first covenant, as not even to have been willing to eat with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For even Peter, although he had been sent to instruct them, and had been constrained by a vision to that effect, spoke nevertheless with not a little hesitation, saying to them: <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. Therefore came I without gainsaying;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013524"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;10:28-29</a></span> indicating by these words, that he would not have come to them unless he had been commanded. Neither, for a like reason, would he have given them <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> so readily, had he not heard them prophesying when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> rested upon them. And therefore did he exclaim, <q>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, who have received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as well as we?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013525"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse47">Acts&nbsp;10:47</a></span> He persuaded, at the same time, those that were with him, and pointed out that, unless the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had rested upon them, there might have been some one who would have raised objections to their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who were with James allowed the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to act freely, yielding us up to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. But they themselves, while <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, continued in the ancient observances; so that even Peter, fearing also lest he might incur their reproof, although formerly eating with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, because of the vision, and of the Spirit who had rested upon them, yet, when certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> came from James, withdrew himself, and did not eat with them. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said that Barnabas likewise did the same thing. <span class="stiki" id="note013526"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse12">Galatians&nbsp;2:12-13</a></span> Thus did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, whom the Lord made witnesses of every action and of every doctrine&mdash; for upon all occasions do we find Peter, and James, and John present with Him&mdash; scrupulously act according to the dispensation of the Mosaic law, showing that it was from one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which they certainly never would have done, as I have already said, if they had learned from the Lord [that there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>] another Father besides Him who appointed the dispensation of the law.</p>
