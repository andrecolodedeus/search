<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 13)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Refutation of the opinion, that Paul was the only apostle who had knowledge of the truth.</span>

<p>1. With regard to those (the Marcionites) who allege that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that to him the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was manifested by revelation, let <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself convict them, when he says, that one and the same God wrought in Peter for the apostolate of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and in himself for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note013527"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Peter, therefore, was an apostle of that very God whose was also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; and Him whom Peter preached as God among those of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and likewise the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> [declare] also among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For our Lord never came to save <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> alone, nor is God so limited in means, that He should have but one apostle who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the dispensation of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And again, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>How beautiful are the feet of those bringing glad tidings of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of peace,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013528"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;10:15</a>; <a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;52:7</a></span> he shows clearly that it was not merely one, but there were many who used to preach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And again, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, when he had recounted all those who had seen God  after the resurrection, he  says in continuation, <q>But whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013530"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:11</a></span> acknowledging as one and the same, the preaching of all those who saw God  after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>.</p>

<p>2. And again, the Lord replied to Philip, who wished to behold the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Have I been so long a time with you, and yet you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, Philip? He that sees Me, sees also the Father; and how do you say then, Show us the Father? For I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me; and henceforth you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, and have seen Him.</q>  To these men, therefore, did the Lord bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that in Himself they had both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and seen the Father (and the Father is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>). To allege, then, that these men did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is to act the part of false witnesses, and of those who have been alienated from the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For why did the Lord send the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note013533"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;10:6</a></span> if these men did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? How also did the seventy preach, unless they had themselves previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what was preached? Or how could Peter have been in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, to whom the Lord gave testimony, that flesh and blood had not revealed to him, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who is in heaven? <span class="stiki" id="note013534"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;16:17</a></span> Just, then, as <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> [was] an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither by man, but by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013535"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> [so with the rest;]  the Son indeed leading them to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the Father revealing to them the Son.</p>

<p>3. But that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> acceded to [the request of] those who summoned him to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, on account of the question [which had been raised], and went up to them, with Barnabas, to Jerusalem, not without reason, but that the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might be confirmed by them, he does himself say, in the Epistle to the Galatians: <q>Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also Titus. But I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which I preached among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013537"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> And again he says, <q>For an hour we did give place to subjection,  that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel might continue with you.</q> If, then, any one shall, from the Acts of the Apostles, carefully scrutinize the time concerning which it is written that he went up to Jerusalem on account of the forementioned question, he will find those years mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> coinciding with it. Thus the statement of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> harmonizes with, and is, as it were, identical with, the testimony of Luke regarding the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>
