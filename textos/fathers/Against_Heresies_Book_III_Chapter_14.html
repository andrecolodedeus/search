<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 14)</h1>

<span class="h1a">If Paul had known any mysteries unrevealed to the other apostles, Luke, his constant companion and fellow-traveller, could not have been ignorant of them; neither could the truth have possibly lain hid from him, through whom alone we learn many and most important particulars of the Gospel history.</span>

<p>1. But that this Luke was inseparable from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and his fellow-labourer in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting, but as bound to do so by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. For he says that when Barnabas, and John who was called Mark, had parted company from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and sailed to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <q>we came to <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013539"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;16:8</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> and when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had beheld in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> a man of Macedonia, saying, <q>Come into Macedonia, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and help us,</q> <q>immediately,</q> he says, <q>we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, understanding that the Lord had called us to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> unto them. Therefore, sailing from <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>, we directed our ship's course towards Samothracia.</q> And then he carefully indicates all the rest of their journey as far as Philippi, and how they delivered their first address: <q>for, sitting down,</q> he says, <q>we spoke unto the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had assembled;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013540"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;16:13</a></span> and certain <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, even a great many. And again does he say, <q>But we sailed from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>, where we abode seven days.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013541"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;20:5-6</a></span> And all the remaining [details] of his course with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> he recounts, indicating with all diligence both places, and cities, and number of days, until they went up to Jerusalem; and what befell <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> there, <span class="stiki" id="note013542"><a href="../bible/act021.htm">Acts&nbsp;21</a></span> how he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in bonds; the name of the centurion who took him in charge; <span class="stiki" id="note013543"><a href="../bible/act027.htm">Acts&nbsp;27</a></span> and the signs of the ships, and how they made shipwreck; <span class="stiki" id="note013544"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;28:11</a></span> and the island upon which they escaped, and how they received kindness there, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> healing the chief man of that island; and how they sailed from thence to Puteoli, and from that arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and for what period they sojourned at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As Luke was present at all these occurrences, he carefully noted them down in writing, so that he cannot be convicted of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> or boastfulness, because all these [particulars] <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> both that he was senior to all those who now teach otherwise, and that he was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. That he  was not merely a follower, but also a fellow-labourer of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but especially of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has himself declared also in the Epistles, saying: <q>Demas has forsaken me, ... and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013545"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:10-11</a></span> From this he shows that he was always attached to and inseparable from him. And again he says, in the Epistle to the Colossians: <q>Luke, the beloved physician, greets you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013546"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse14">Colossians&nbsp;4:14</a></span> But surely if Luke, who always preached in company with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and is called by him <q>the beloved,</q> and with him performed the work of an <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, and was entrusted to hand down to us a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, learned nothing different from him (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>), as has been pointed out from his words, how can these men, who were never attached to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, boast that they have learned hidden and unspeakable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>?</p>

<p>2. But that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> taught with simplicity what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, not only to those who were [employed] with him, but to those that heard him, he does himself make manifest. For when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who came from Ephesus and the other cities adjoining had assembled in Miletus, since he was himself hastening to Jerusalem to observe Pentecost, after testifying many things to them, and declaring what must happen to him at Jerusalem, he added: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you shall see my face no more. Therefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Take heed, therefore, both to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has placed you as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord,  which He has acquired for Himself through His own blood.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013548"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse25">Acts&nbsp;20:25</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Then, referring to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> teachers who should arise, he said: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that after my departure shall grievous wolves come to you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after them.</q> <q>I have not shunned,</q> he says, <q>to declare unto you all the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Thus did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> simply, and without respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, deliver to all what they had themselves learned from the Lord. Thus also does Luke, without respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, deliver to us what he had learned from them, as he has himself testified, saying, <q>Even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013549"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;1:2</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Now if any man set Luke aside, as one who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he will, [by so acting,] manifestly reject that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of which he claims to be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. For through him we have become acquainted with very many and important parts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; for instance, the generation of John, the history of Zacharias, the coming of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to Mary, the exclamation of <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>, the descent of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the shepherds, the words spoken by them, the testimony of Anna and of Simeon with regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that twelve years of age He was left behind at Jerusalem; also the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, the number of the Lord's years when He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and that this occurred in the fifteenth year of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>. And in His office of teacher this is what He has said to the rich: <q>Woe unto you that are rich, for you have received your consolation;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013550"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;6:24</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> and <q>Woe unto you that are full, for you shall hunger; and you who laugh now, for you shall weep;</q> and, <q>Woe unto you when all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall speak well of you: for so did your fathers to the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>.</q> All things of the following kind we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through Luke alone (and numerous actions of the Lord we have learned through him, which also all [the Evangelists] notice): the multitude of fishes which Peter's companions enclosed, when at the Lord's command they cast the nets; <span class="stiki" id="note013551"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm">Luke&nbsp;5</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had suffered for eighteen years, and was healed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note013552"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm">Luke&nbsp;13</a></span> the man who had the dropsy, whom the Lord made whole on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and how He did defend Himself for having performed an act of healing on that day; how He taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not to aspire to the uppermost rooms; how we should invite the poor and feeble, who cannot recompense us; the man who knocked during the night to obtain loaves, and did obtain them, because of the urgency of his importunity; <span class="stiki" id="note013553"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm">Luke&nbsp;11</a></span> how, when [our Lord] was sitting at meat with a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that was a sinner kissed His feet, and anointed them with ointment, with what the Lord said to Simon on her behalf concerning the two debtors; <span class="stiki" id="note013554"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke&nbsp;7</a></span> also about the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of that rich man who stored up the goods which had accrued to him, to whom it was also said, <q>In this night they shall demand your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from you; whose then shall those things be which you have prepared?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013555"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;12:20</a></span> and similar to this, that of the rich man, who was clothed in purple and who fared sumptuously, and the indigent Lazarus; <span class="stiki" id="note013556"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm">Luke&nbsp;16</a></span> also the answer which He gave to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when they said, <q>Increase our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013557"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;17:5</a></span> also His conversation with Zaccheus the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note013558"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm">Luke&nbsp;19</a></span> also about  the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, who were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in the temple at the same time; <span class="stiki" id="note013559"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm">Luke&nbsp;18</a></span> also the ten <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, whom He cleansed in the way simultaneously; <span class="stiki" id="note013560"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm">Luke&nbsp;17</a></span> also how He ordered the lame and the blind to be gathered to the wedding from the lanes and streets; <span class="stiki" id="note013561"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm">Luke&nbsp;18</a></span> also the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the judge who feared not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> importunity led to avenge her <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note013562"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm">Luke&nbsp;13</a></span> and about the fig-tree in the vineyard which produced no fruit. There are also many other particulars to be found mentioned by Luke alone, which are made use of by both <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>. And besides all these, [he records] what [Christ] said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the way, after the resurrection, and how they recognised Him in the breaking of bread. <span class="stiki" id="note013563"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm">Luke&nbsp;24</a></span> </p>

<p>4. It follows then, as of course, that these men must either receive the rest of his narrative, or else reject these parts also. For no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of common sense can permit them to receive some things recounted by Luke as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and to set others aside, as if he had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And if indeed <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> followers reject these, they will then possess no <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; for, curtailing that according to Luke, as I have said already, they boast in having the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> [in what remains]. But the followers of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> must give up their utterly vain talk; for they have taken from that [<a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>] many occasions for their own speculations, to put an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> interpretation upon what he has well said. If, on the other hand, they feel compelled to receive the remaining portions also, then, by studying the perfect <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, they will find it necessary to repent, that they may be saved from the danger [to which they are exposed].</p>
