<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 16)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Proofs from the apostolic writings, that Jesus Christ was one and the same, the only begotten Son of God, perfect God and perfect man.</span>

<p>1. But  there are some who say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was merely a receptacle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, upon whom the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, as a dove, descended from above, and that when He had declared the unnameable Father He entered into the Pleroma in an incomprehensible and invisible manner: for that He was not comprehended, not only by men, but not even by those powers and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are in heaven, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but that  Christ was the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while others say that He merely suffered in outward appearance, being naturally impassible. The <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, again, maintain that the dispensational Jesus was the same who passed through Mary, upon whom that Saviour from the more exalted [region] descended, who was also termed <em>Pan</em>,  because He possessed the names (<em>vocabula</em>) of all those who had produced Him; but that [this latter] shared with Him, the dispensational one, His power and His name; so that by His means death was abolished, but the Father was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by that Saviour who had descended from above, whom they do also allege to be Himself the receptacle of Christ and of the entire Pleroma; confessing, indeed, in tongue one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, but being divided in [actual] opinion: for, as I have already observed, it is the practice of these men to say that there was one Christ, who was produced by Monogenes, for the confirmation of the Pleroma; but that another, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, was sent [forth] for the glorification of the Father; and yet another, the dispensational one, and whom they represent as having suffered, who also bore [in himself] Christ, that Saviour who returned into the Pleroma. I judge it necessary therefore to take into account the entire mind of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and to show that not only did they never hold any such opinions regarding Him; but, still further, that they announced through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that those who should teach such doctrines were agents of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, sent forth for the purpose of overturning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some, and drawing them away from life.</p>

<p>2. That John <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the one and the same <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and that He was the only begotten, and that He became incarnate for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, I have sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the word of John himself. And Matthew, too, recognising one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, exhibiting his generation as a man from the Virgin,  even as God did promise David that He would raise up from the fruit of his body an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> King, having made the same promise to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> a long time previously, says: <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013573"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Then, that he might free our mind from suspicion regarding Joseph, he says: <q>But the birth of Christ  was on this  wise. When His mother was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Then, when Joseph had it in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> to put Mary away, since she <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> with child, [Matthew tells us of] the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of God standing by him, and saying: <q>Fear not to take unto you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive, and bring forth a son, and they shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which is, God with us;</q> clearly signifying that both the promise made to the fathers had been accomplished, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and that He Himself was Christ the Saviour whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had foretold; not, as these men assert, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was He who was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, but that Christ was He who descended from above. Matthew might certainly have said, <q>Now the birth of <em>Jesus</em> was on this wise;</q> but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, foreseeing the corrupters [of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>], and guarding by anticipation against their deceit, says by Matthew, <q>But the birth of <em>Christ</em> was on this wise;</q> and that He is <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, lest perchance we might consider Him as a mere man: for <q>not by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh nor by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God was the Word made flesh;</q>  and that we should not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was one, and Christ another, but should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be one and the same.</p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when writing to the Romans, has explained this very point: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, an apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which He had promised by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, concerning His Son, who was made to Him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power through the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013576"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;1:1-4</a></span> And again, writing to the Romans about <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, he says: <q>Whose are the fathers, and from whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all, blessed for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013577"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> And again, in his Epistle to the Galatians, he says: <q>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013578"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4-5</a></span> plainly indicating one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who did by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> make promise of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, who was of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to His birth from Mary; and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was appointed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power, according to the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>, as being the first begotten in all the creation; <span class="stiki" id="note013579"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse14">Colossians&nbsp;1:14-15</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> being made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, that through Him we may receive the adoption,&mdash; humanity  sustaining, and receiving, and embracing the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Wherefore Mark also says: <q>The beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013581"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse1">Mark&nbsp;1:1</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> one and the same <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who was announced by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who from the fruit of David's body was <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, <q>the messenger of great counsel of the Father;</q>  through whom God caused the day-spring and the Just One to arise to the house of David, and raised up for him an horn of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <q>and established a testimony in Jacob;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013583"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse69">Luke&nbsp;1:69</a></span> as David says when discoursing on the causes of His birth: <q>And He appointed a law in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that another generation might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> [Him,] the children which should he born from these, and they arising shall themselves declare to their children, so that they might set their hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seek after His commandments.</q>  And again, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said, when bringing good tidings to Mary: <q>He shall he great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord shall give unto Him the throne of His father David;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013585"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;1:32</a></span> acknowledging that He who is the Son of the Highest, the same is Himself also the Son of David. And David, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> by the Spirit the dispensation of the advent of this Person, by which He is supreme over all the living and dead, confessed Him as Lord, sitting on the right hand of the Most High Father. </p>

<p>4. But Simeon also &mdash; he who had received an intimation from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> that he should not see death, until first he had beheld Christ Jesus&mdash; taking Him, the first-begotten of the Virgin, into his hands, blessed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said, <q>Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word: because my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which You have prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Your people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013587"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;2:29</a></span> confessing thus, that the infant whom he was holding in his hands, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, was Christ Himself, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the light of all, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> itself,  and the peace and refreshing of those who had fallen asleep. For He was already despoiling men, by removing their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, conferring upon them His own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and scattering abroad those who recognised Him, as Esaias says: <q>Call His name, Quickly spoil, Rapidly divide.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013588"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;8:3</a></span> Now these are the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He therefore was Himself Christ, whom Simeon carrying [in his arms] blessed the Most High; on beholding whom the shepherds <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whom John, while yet in his mother's womb, and He (Christ) in that of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, recognising as the Lord, saluted with leaping; whom the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, when they had seen, adored, and offered their gifts [to Him], as I have already stated, and prostrated themselves to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> King, departed by another way, not now returning by the way of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. <q>For before the child shall have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to cry, Father or mother, He shall receive the power of Damascus, and the spoils of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, against the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013589"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;8:4</a></span> declaring, in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> manner indeed, but emphatically, that the Lord did fight with a hidden hand against Amalek.  For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, too, He suddenly removed those children belonging to the house of David, whose <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> lot it was to have been born at that time, that He might send them on before into His kingdom; He, since He was Himself an infant, so arranging it that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infants should be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, slain, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Judah, in the city of David. <span class="stiki" id="note013591"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;2:16</a></span> </p>

<p>5. Therefore did the Lord also say to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after the resurrection, <q>O thoughtless ones, and slow of heart to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have spoken! Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013592"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;24:25</a></span> And again does He say to them: <q>These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, concerning Me. Then opened He their understanding, that they should understand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, and that repentance for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be preached in His name among all nations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013593"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;24:44</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Now this is He who was born of Mary; for He says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must suffer many things, and be rejected, and crucified, and on the third day rise again.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no other <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> but Him who was of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, who also suffered; and no Christ who flew away from Jesus before the passion; but Him who was born it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that this same suffered and rose again, as John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord, verifies, saying: <q>But these are written, that you might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that believing you might have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life in His name,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013595"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;20:31</a></span> &mdash; foreseeing these <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> systems which divide the Lord, as far as lies in their power, saying that He was formed of two different substances. For this reason also he has thus testified to us in his Epistle: <q>Little children, it is the last time; and as you have heard that <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> does come, now have many antichrists appeared; whereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but [they departed], that they might be made manifest that they are not of us. Know therefore, that every lie is from without, and is not of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Who is a liar, but he that denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ? This is <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.</q> </p>

<p>6. But inasmuch as all those before mentioned, although they certainly do with their tongue confess one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, make fools of themselves, thinking one thing and saying another;  for their hypotheses vary, as I have already shown, alleging, [as they do,] that one Being suffered and was born, and that this was Jesus; but that there was another who descended upon Him, and that this was Christ, who also ascended again; and they argue, that he who proceeded from the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, or he who was dispensational, or he who sprang from Joseph, was the Being subject to suffering; but upon the latter there descended from the invisible and ineffable [places] the former, whom they assert to be incomprehensible, invisible, and impassible: they thus wander from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because their doctrine departs from Him who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that His only-begotten Word, who is always present with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, united to and mingled with His own creation, according to the Father's pleasure, and who became flesh, is Himself <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, who did also suffer for us, and rose again on our behalf, and who will come again in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Father, to raise up all flesh, and for the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and to apply the rule of just judgment to all who were made by Him. There is therefore, as I have pointed out, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who came by means of the whole dispensational arrangements [connected with Him], and gathered  together all things in Himself. <span class="stiki" id="note013598"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> But in every respect, too, He is man, the formation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus He took up man into Himself, the invisible becoming visible, the incomprehensible being made comprehensible, the impassible becoming capable of suffering, and the Word being made man, thus summing up all things in Himself: so that as in super-celestial, spiritual, and invisible things, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is supreme, so also in things visible and corporeal He might possess the supremacy, and, taking to Himself the pre-eminence, as well as constituting Himself Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, He might draw all things to Himself at the proper time.</p>

<p>7. With Him is nothing incomplete or out of due season, just as with the Father there is nothing incongruous. For all these things were foreknown by the Father; but the Son works them out at the proper time in perfect order and sequence. This was the reason why, when Mary was urging [Him] on to [perform] the wonderful <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the wine, and was desirous before the time to partake  of the cup of emblematic significance, the Lord, checking her untimely haste, said, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour is not yet come</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013600"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;2:4</a></span> &mdash; waiting for that hour which was foreknown by the Father. This is also the reason why, when men were often desirous to take Him, it is said, <q>No man laid hands upon Him, for the hour of His being taken was not yet come;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013601"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;7:30</a></span> nor the time of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, which had been foreknown by the Father; as also says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Habakkuk, <q>By this You shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when the years have drawn near; You shall be set forth when the time comes; because my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is disturbed by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, You shall remember Your mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013602"><a href="../bible/hab003.htm#verse2">Habakkuk&nbsp;3:2</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says: <q>But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013603"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> By which is made manifest, that all things which had been foreknown of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, our Lord did accomplish in their order, season, and hour, foreknown and fitting, being indeed one and the same, but rich and great. For He fulfils the bountiful and comprehensive will of His Father, inasmuch as He is Himself the Saviour of those who are saved, and the Lord of those who are under authority, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all those things which have been formed, the only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Christ who was announced, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who became incarnate when the fullness of time had come, at which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had to become the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</p>

<p>8. All, therefore, are outside of the [<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>] dispensation, who, under pretext of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, understand that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was one, and Christ another, and the Only-begotten another, from whom again is the Word, and that the Saviour is another, whom these <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> allege to be a production of those who were made <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> in a state of degeneracy. Such men are to outward appearance sheep; for they appear to be like us, by what they say in public, repeating the same words as we do; but inwardly they are wolves. Their doctrine is homicidal, conjuring up, as it does, a number of gods, and simulating many Fathers, but lowering and dividing the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in many ways. These are they against whom the Lord has cautioned us beforehand; and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, in his Epistle already mentioned, commands us to avoid them, when he says: <q>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. Take heed to them, that you lose not what you have wrought.</q>  And again does he say in the Epistle: <q>Many <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> are gone out into the world. Hereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>: Every spirit that confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and every spirit which separates <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is of antichrist.</q>  These words agree with what was said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us.</q> Wherefore he again exclaims in his Epistle, <q>Every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, has been born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013606"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:1</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to be one and the same, to whom the gates of heaven were opened, because of His taking upon Him flesh: who shall also come in the same flesh in which He suffered, revealing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father.</p>

<p>9. Concurring with these statements, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, speaking to the Romans, declares: <q>Much more they who receive abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and righteousness for [<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>] life, shall reign by one, Christ Jesus.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013607"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;5:17</a></span> It follows from this, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of that Christ who flew away from Jesus; nor did he of the Saviour above, whom they hold to be impassible. For if, in  <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the one suffered, and the other remained incapable of suffering, and the one was born, but the other descended upon him who was born, and left him again, it is not one, but two, that are shown forth. But that the apostle did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him as one, both who was born and who suffered, namely <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, he again says in the same Epistle: <q>Do you not know, that so many of us as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Christ Jesus were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death? That like as Christ rose from the dead, so should we also walk in newness of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013608"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;6:3-4</a></span> But again, showing that Christ did suffer, and was Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who died for us, and redeemed us with His blood at the time appointed beforehand, he says: <q>For how is it, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when we were yet without strength, in due time died for the ungodly? But God commends His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> through Him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.</q>  He declares in the plainest manner, that the same Being who was laid hold of, and underwent suffering, and shed His blood for us, was both Christ and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who did also rise again, and was taken up into heaven, as he himself [<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>] says: <q>But at the same time, [it, is] Christ [that] died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013610"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse34">Romans&nbsp;8:34</a></span> And again, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, rising from the dead, dies no more:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013611"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;6:9</a></span> for, as himself foreseeing, through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the subdivisions of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> teachers [with regard to the Lord's person], and being desirous of cutting away from them all occasion of cavil, he says what has been already stated, [and also declares:] <q>But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013612"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;8:11</a></span> This he does not utter to those alone who wish to hear: Do not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, [he says to all:] <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is one and the same, who did by suffering reconcile us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and rose from the dead; who is at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and perfect in all things; <q>who, when He was buffeted, struck not in return; who, when He suffered, threatened not;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013613"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:23</a></span> and when He underwent tyranny, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> His Father that He would forgive those who had crucified Him. For He did Himself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> bring in <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: since He is Himself the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, Himself the Only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</p>
