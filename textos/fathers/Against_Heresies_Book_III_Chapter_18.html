<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 18)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Continuation of the foregoing argument. Proofs from the writings of St. Paul, and from the words of Our Lord, that Christ and Jesus cannot be considered as distinct beings; neither can it be alleged that the Son of God became man merely in appearance, but that He did so truly and actually.</span>

<p>1.  As it has been clearly demonstrated that  the Word, who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom all things were made, who was also always present with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, was in these last days, according to the time appointed by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, united to His own workmanship, inasmuch as He became a man liable to suffering, [it follows] that every objection is set aside of those who say, <q>If our Lord was born at that time, Christ had therefore no previous <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</q> For I have shown that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not then begin to exist, being with the Father from the beginning; but when He became incarnate, and was made man, He commenced afresh  the long line of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, and furnished us, in a brief, comprehensive manner, with <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; so that what we had lost in Adam&mdash; namely, to be according to the image and likeness of God&mdash; that we might recover in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</p>

<p>2. For as it was not possible that the man who had once for all been conquered, and who had been destroyed through disobedience, could reform himself, and obtain the prize of victory; and as it was also impossible that he could attain to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> who had fallen under the power of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;the Son effected both these things, being the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, descending from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, becoming incarnate, stooping low, even to death, and consummating the arranged plan of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, upon whom [<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>], exhorting us unhesitatingly to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, again says, <q>Who shall ascend into heaven? That is, to bring down Christ; or who shall descend into the deep? That is, to liberate Christ again from the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013634"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;10:6-7</a></span> Then he continues, <q>If you shall confess with your mouth the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013635"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;10:9</a></span> And he renders the reason why the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did these things, saying, <q>For to this end Christ both lived, and died, and revived, that He might rule over the living and the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013636"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;14:9</a></span> And again, writing to the Corinthians, he declares, <q>But we preach Christ Jesus crucified;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013637"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> and adds, <q>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013638"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:16</a></span> </p>

<p>3. But who is it that has had fellowship with us in the matter of food? Whether is it he who is conceived of by them as the Christ above, who extended himself through Horos, and imparted a form to their mother; or is it He who is from the Virgin, <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, who ate butter and honey, <span class="stiki" id="note013639"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;8:14</a></span> of whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declared, <q>He is also a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013640"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:9</a></span> He was likewise preached by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: <q>For I delivered,</q> he says, <q>unto you first of all, that Christ died for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and that He was buried, and rose again the third day, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013641"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:3-4</a></span> It is plain, then, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no other Christ besides Him alone, who both suffered, and was buried, and rose gain, who was also born, and whom he speaks of as man. For after remarking, <q>But if Christ be preached, that He rose from the dead,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013642"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:12</a></span> he continues, rendering the reason of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, <q>For since by man came death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.</q> And everywhere, when [referring to] the passion of our Lord, and to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and His subjection to death, he employs the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as in that passage: <q>Destroy not him with your meat for whom Christ died.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013643"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;14:15</a></span> And again: <q>But now, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013644"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> And again: <q>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs upon a tree.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013645"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;3:13</a>; <a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy&nbsp;21:23</a></span> And again: <q>And through your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013646"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:11</a></span> indicating that the impassible Christ did not descend upon Jesus, but that He Himself, because He was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, suffered for us; He, who lay in the tomb, and rose again, who descended and ascended,&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> having been made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, as the very name itself does declare. For in the name of Christ is implied, He that anoints, He that is anointed, and the unction itself with which He is anointed. And it is the Father who anoints, but the Son who is anointed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who is the unction, as the Word declares by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon me, because He has anointed me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013647"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> &mdash; pointing out both the anointing Father, the anointed Son, and the unction, which is the Spirit.</p>

<p>4. The Lord Himself, too, makes it evident who it was that suffered; for when He asked the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Who do men say that I, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, am?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013648"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;16:13</a></span> and when <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> had replied, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and when he had been commended by Him [in these words], <q>That flesh and blood had not revealed it to him, but the Father who is in heaven,</q> He made it clear that He, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, is Christ the Son of the living God. <q>For from that time forth,</q> it is said, <q>He began to show to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, how that He must go unto Jerusalem,  and suffer many things of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and be rejected, and crucified, and rise again the third day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013649"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;16:21</a></span> He who was acknowledged by Peter as Christ, who pronounced him blessed because the Father had revealed the Son of the living God to him, said that He must Himself suffer many things, and be crucified; and then He rebuked Peter, who imagined that He was the Christ as the generality of men supposed  [that the Christ should be], and was averse to the idea of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a>, [and] said to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose it for My sake shall save it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013651"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;16:24-25</a></span> For these things Christ spoke openly, He being Himself the Saviour of those who should be delivered over to death for their confession of Him, and lose their lives.</p>

<p>5. If, however, He was Himself not to suffer, but should fly away from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, why did He exhort His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to take up the cross and follow Him&mdash;that cross which these men represent Him as not having taken up, but [speak of Him] as having relinquished the dispensation of suffering? For that He did not say this with reference to the acknowledging of the <em>Stauros</em> (cross) above, as some among them venture to expound, but with respect to the suffering which He should Himself undergo, and that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should endure, He implies when He says, <q>For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose, shall find it.</q> And that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> must suffer for His sake, He [implied when He] said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>Behold, I send you <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and wise men, and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>: and some of them you shall kill and crucify.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013652"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;23:24</a></span> And to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> He was wont to say, <q>And you shall stand before governors and kings for My sake; and they shall scourge some of you, and slay you, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you from city to city.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013653"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;10:17-18</a></span> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, therefore, both those who should suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> those who should have to be scourged and slain because of Him; and He did not speak of any other cross, but of the suffering which He should Himself undergo first, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> afterwards. For this purpose did He give them this exhortation: <q>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but rather <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him who is able to send both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013654"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a></span> [thus exhorting them] to hold fast those professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they had made in reference to Him. For He promised to confess before His Father those who should confess His name before men; but declared that He would deny those who should deny Him, and would be ashamed of those who should be ashamed to confess Him. And although these things are so, some of these men have proceeded to such a degree of temerity, that they even pour contempt upon the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and vituperate those who are slain on account of the confession of the Lord, and who suffer all things predicted by the Lord, and who in this respect strive to follow the footprints of the Lord's passion, having become <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the suffering One; these we do also enrol with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> themselves. For, when inquisition shall be made for their blood,  and they shall attain to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, then all shall be confounded by Christ, who have cast a slur upon their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. And from this fact, that He exclaimed upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013656"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> the long-suffering, patience, compassion, and goodness of Christ are exhibited, since He both suffered, and did Himself exculpate those who had maltreated Him. For the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who said to us, <q>Love your enemies, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013657"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> Himself did this very thing upon the cross; loving the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> to such a degree, that He even <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for those putting Him to death. If, however, any one, going upon the supposition that there are two [Christs], forms a judgment in regard to them, that [Christ] shall be found much the better one, and more patient, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good one, who, in the midst of His own wounds and stripes, and the other [cruelties] inflicted upon Him, was beneficent, and unmindful of the wrongs perpetrated upon Him, than he who flew away, and sustained neither injury nor insult.</p>

<p>6. This also does likewise meet [the case] of those who maintain that He suffered only in appearance. For if He did not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> suffer, no thanks to Him, since there was no suffering at all; and when we shall actually begin to suffer, He will seem as leading us astray, exhorting us to endure buffering, and to turn the other <span class="stiki" id="note013658"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39</a></span> cheek, if He did not Himself before us in reality suffer the same; and as He misled them by seeming to them what He was not, so does He also mislead us, by exhorting us to endure what He did not endure Himself. [In that case] we shall be even above the Master, because we suffer and sustain what our Master never bore or endured. But as our Lord is alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Master, so the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good and patient, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> the Father having been made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. For He fought and conquered; for He was man contending for the fathers,  and  through <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> doing away with disobedience completely: for He bound the strong man, <span class="stiki" id="note013660"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;12:29</a></span> and set free the weak, and endowed His own handiwork with <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, by destroying <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For He is a most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and merciful Lord, and loves the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.</p>

<p>7. Therefore, as I have already said, He caused man (<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>) to cleave to and to become, one with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For unless man had overcome the enemy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the enemy would not have been legitimately vanquished. And again: unless it had been God who had freely given <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, we could never have possessed it securely. And unless man had been joined to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he could never have become a partaker of incorruptibility. For it was incumbent upon the Mediator between God and men, by His relationship to both, to bring both to friendship and concord, and present man to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while He revealed God to man.  For, in what way could we be partaken of the adoption of sons, unless we had received from Him through the Son that fellowship which refers to Himself, unless His Word, having been made flesh, had entered into communion with us? Wherefore also He passed through every stage of life, restoring to all communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Those, therefore, who assert that He appeared putatively, and was neither born in the flesh nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> made man, are as yet under the old condemnation, holding out patronage to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for, by their showing, death has not been vanquished, which <q>reigned from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, even over them that had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> after the similitude of Adam's transgression.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013662"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;5:14</a></span> But the law coming, which was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and testifying of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that it is a sinner, did <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> take away his (death's) kingdom, showing that he was no king, but a robber; and it revealed him as a murderer. It laid, however, a weighty burden upon man, who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in himself, showing that he was liable to death. For as the law was spiritual, it merely made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had no dominion over the spirit, but over man. For it behooved Him who was to destroy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and redeem man under the power of death, that He should Himself be made that very same thing which he was, that is, man; who had been drawn by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into bondage, but was held by death, so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should be destroyed by man, and man should go forth from death. For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, <span class="stiki" id="note013663"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;5:19</a></span> and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of one man, who was originally born from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, many should be justified and receive <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Thus, then, was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> made man, as also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> are His works.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013664"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:4</a></span> But if, not having been made flesh, He did appear as if flesh, His work was not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one. But what He did appear, that He also was: God recapitulated in Himself the ancient formation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that He might kill <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, deprive death of its power, and vivify man; and therefore His works are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>
