<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 19)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Jesus Christ was not a mere man, begotten from Joseph in the ordinary course of nature, but was very God, begotten of the Father most high, and very man, born of the Virgin.</span>

<p>1. But again, those who assert that He was simply a mere man, begotten by Joseph, remaining in the bondage of the old disobedience, are in a state of death having been not as yet joined to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor receiving liberty through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as He does Himself declare: <q>If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013665"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;8:36</a></span> But, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him who from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a> is <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, they are deprived of His gift, which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; <span class="stiki" id="note013666"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;6:23</a></span> and not receiving the incorruptible Word, they remain in mortal flesh, and are debtors to death, not obtaining the antidote of life. To whom the Word says, mentioning His own gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: <q>I said, You are all the sons of the Highest, and gods; but you shall die like men.</q>  He speaks undoubtedly these words to those who have not received the gift of adoption, but who despise the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the pure generation of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>,  defraud <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of promotion into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and prove themselves ungrateful to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who became flesh for them. For it was for this end that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was made man, and He who was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, that man, having been taken into the Word, and receiving the adoption, might become the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>. For by no other means could we have attained to incorruptibility and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, unless we had been united to incorruptibility and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But how could we be joined to incorruptibility and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, unless, first, incorruptibility and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> had  become that which we also are, so that the corruptible might be swallowed up by incorruptibility, and the mortal by <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, that we might receive the adoption of sons?</p>

<p>2. For this reason [it is, said], <q>Who shall declare His generation?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013669"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> since <q>He is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and who shall recognise Him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013670"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:9</a></span> But he to whom the Father which is in heaven has revealed Him, <span class="stiki" id="note013671"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him, so that he understands that He who <q>was not born either by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, or by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013672"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;1:13</a></span> is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, this is Christ, the Son of the living God. For I have shown from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,  that no one of the sons of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is as to everything, and absolutely, called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or named Lord. But that He is Himself in His own right, beyond all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who ever lived, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Lord, and King Eternal, and the Incarnate Word, proclaimed by all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and by the Spirit Himself, may be seen by all who have attained to even a small portion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> would not have testified these things of Him, if, like others, He had been a mere man. But that He had, beyond all others, in Himself that pre-eminent birth which is from the Most High Father, and also experienced that pre-eminent generation which is from the Virgin, <span class="stiki" id="note013674"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> do in both respects testify of Him: also, that He was a man without comeliness, and liable to suffering; <span class="stiki" id="note013675"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;53:2</a></span> that He sat upon the foal of an ass; <span class="stiki" id="note013676"><a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;9:9</a></span> that He received for drink, vinegar and gall;  that He was despised among the people, and humbled Himself even to death and that He is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, the Beautiful in appearance, and the Mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note013678"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;9:6</a></span> coming on the clouds as the Judge of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note013679"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13</a></span> &mdash; all these things did the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> prophesy of Him.</p>

<p>3. For as He became man in order to undergo <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, so also was He the Word that He might be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; the Word remaining quiescent, that He might be capable of being tempted, dishonoured, crucified, and of suffering death, but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being swallowed up in it (the divine), when it conquered, and endured [without yielding], and performed acts of kindness, and rose again, and was received up [into heaven]. He therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, our Lord, being the Word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, since He had a generation as to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from Mary&mdash; who was descended from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and who was herself a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being&mdash; was made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note013680"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;7:13</a></span> Wherefore also the Lord Himself gave us a sign, in the depth below, and in the height above, which man did not ask for, because he never expected that a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> could conceive, or that it was possible that one remaining a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> could bring forth a son, and that what was thus born should be <q> <em>God with us</em>,</q> and descend to those things which are of the earth beneath, seeking the sheep which had perished, which was indeed His own peculiar handiwork, and ascend to the height above, offering and commending to His Father that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (<em>hominem</em>) which had been found, making in His own person the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the resurrection of man; that, as the Head rose from the dead, so also the remaining part of the body&mdash; [namely, the body] of everyman who is found in life&mdash; when the time is fulfilled of that condemnation which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> by reason of disobedience, may arise, blended together and strengthened through means of joints and bands <span class="stiki" id="note013681"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse16">Ephesians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> by the increase of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, each of the members having its own proper and fit position in the body. For there are many mansions in the Father's house, <span class="stiki" id="note013682"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;14:2</a></span> inasmuch as there are also many members in the body.</p>
