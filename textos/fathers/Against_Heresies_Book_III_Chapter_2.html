<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 2)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The heretics follow neither Scripture nor tradition.</span>

<p>1. When, however, they are confuted from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, they turn round and accuse these same Scriptures, as if they were not correct, nor of authority, and [assert] that they are ambiguous, and that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot be extracted from them by those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of tradition. For [they allege] that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was not delivered by means of written documents, but <em>viv&acirc; voce: </em>wherefore also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declared, <q>But we speak wisdom among those that are perfect, but not the wisdom of this world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013311"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> And this wisdom each one of them alleges to be the fiction of his own inventing, forsooth; so that, according to their idea, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> properly resides at one time in <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, at another in <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, at another in <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, then afterwards in <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, or has even been indifferently in any other opponent,  who could speak nothing pertaining to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For every one of these men, being altogether of a perverse disposition, depraving the system of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is not ashamed to preach himself.</p>

<p>2. But, again, when we refer them to that tradition which originates from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, [and] which is preserved by means of the succession of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, they object to tradition, saying that they themselves are wiser not merely than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, but even than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, because they have discovered the unadulterated <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For [they maintain] that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> intermingled the things of the law with the words of the Saviour; and that not the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> alone, but even the Lord Himself, spoke as at one time from the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, at another from the intermediate place, and yet again from the Pleroma, but that they themselves, indubitably, unsulliedly, and purely, have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: this is, indeed, to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> their Creator after a most impudent manner! It comes to this, therefore, that these men do now consent neither to Scripture nor to tradition.</p>

<p>3. Such are the adversaries with whom we have to deal, my very dear friend, endeavouring like slippery serpents to escape at all points. Where-fore they must be opposed at all points, if per-chance, by cutting off their retreat, we may succeed in turning them back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For, though it is not an easy thing for a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> under the influence of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to repent, yet, on the other hand, it is not altogether impossible to escape from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is brought alongside it.</p>
