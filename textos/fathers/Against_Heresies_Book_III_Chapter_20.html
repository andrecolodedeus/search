<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 20)</h1>

<span class="h1a">God showed himself, by the fall of man, as patient, benign, merciful, mighty to save. Man is therefore most ungrateful, if, unmindful of his own lot, and of the benefits held out to him, he do not acknowledge divine grace.</span>

<p>1. Long-suffering therefore was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when man became a defaulter, as foreseeing that victory which should be granted to him through the Word. For, when strength was made perfect in weakness, <span class="stiki" id="note013683"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:9</a></span> it showed the kindness and transcendent power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as He patiently suffered Jonah to be swallowed by the whale, not that he should be swallowed up and perish altogether, but that, having been cast out again, he might be the more subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and might glorify Him the more who had conferred upon him such an unhoped-for deliverance, and might bring the Ninevites to a lasting repentance, so that they should be converted to the Lord, who would deliver them from death, having been struck with awe by that portent which had been wrought in Jonah's case, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says of them, <q>And they returned each from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way, and the unrighteousness which was in their hands, saying, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> if God will repent, and turn away His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> from us, and we shall not perish?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013684"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse8">Jonah&nbsp;3:8-9</a></span> &mdash; so also, from the beginning, did God permit man to be  swallowed up by the great whale, who was the author of transgression, not that he should perish altogether when so engulphed; but, arranging and preparing the plan of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which was accomplished by the Word, through the sign of Jonah, for those who held the same opinion as Jonah regarding the Lord, and who confessed, and said, <q>I am a servant of the Lord, and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013685"><a href="../bible/jon001.htm#verse9">Jonah&nbsp;1:9</a></span> [This was done] that man, receiving an unhoped-for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, might rise from the dead, and glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and repeat that word which was uttered in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> by Jonah: <q>I cried by reason of my affliction to the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He heard me out of the belly of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013686"><a href="../bible/jon002.htm#verse2">Jonah&nbsp;2:2</a></span> and that he might always continue glorifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and giving thanks without ceasing, for that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which he has derived from Him, <q>that no flesh should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord's presence;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013687"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:29</a></span> and that man should never adopt an opposite opinion with regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, supposing that the incorruptibility which belongs to him is his own naturally, and by thus not holding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, should boast with empty superciliousness, as if he were naturally like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he (<a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>) thus rendered him (man) more ungrateful towards his Creator, obscured the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had towards man, and blinded his mind not to perceive what is worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, comparing himself with, and judging himself equal to, God.</p>

<p>2. This, therefore, was the [object of the] long-suffering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that man, passing through all things, and acquiring the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of moral discipline, then attaining to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>, and learning by experience what is the source of his deliverance, may always live in a state of gratitude to the Lord, having obtained from Him the gift of incorruptibility, that he might <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him the more; for <q>he to whom more is forgiven, loves more:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013688"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;7:43</a></span> and that he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself, how mortal and weak he is; while he also understands respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and powerful to such a degree as to confer <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> upon what is mortal, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> upon what is temporal; and may understand also the other attributes of God displayed towards himself, by means of which being instructed he may think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in accordance with the divine greatness. For the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of man [is] <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but [His] works [are the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>] of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the receptacle of all His wisdom and power [is] man. Just as the physician is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by his patients, so is God also revealed through men. And therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares, <q>For God has concluded all in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013689"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;11:32</a></span> not saying this in reference to spiritual <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who had been disobedient to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and being cast off from <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, then obtained mercy, receiving through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> that adoption which is [accomplished] by Himself. For he who holds, without <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and boasting, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (opinion) regarding <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things and the Creator, who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> of all, and who has granted <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to all; [such an one,] continuing in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <span class="stiki" id="note013690"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;15:9</a></span> and subjection, and giving of thanks, shall also receive from Him the greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of promotion,  looking forward to the time when he shall become like Him who died for him, for He, too, <q>was made in the likeness of sinful flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013692"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3</a></span> to condemn <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and to cast it, as now a condemned thing, away beyond the flesh, but that He might call man forth into His own likeness, assigning him as [His own] imitator to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and imposing on him His Father's law, in order that he may see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and granting him power to receive the Father; [being]  the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> who dwelt in man, and became the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, that He might accustom man to receive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God to dwell in man, according to the good pleasure of the Father.</p>

<p>3. On this account, therefore, the Lord Himself,  who is <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> from the Virgin, <span class="stiki" id="note013695"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;7:4</a></span> is the sign of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since it was the Lord Himself who saved them, because they could not be saved by their own instrumentality; and, therefore, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> sets forth <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, he says: <q>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there dwells in my flesh no good thing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013696"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> showing that the <q>good thing</q> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not from us, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And again: <q>Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013697"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> Then he introduces the Deliverer, [saying,] <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> And Isaiah declares this also, [when he says:] <q>Be strengthened, you hands that hang down, and you feeble knees; be encouraged, you feeble-minded; be comforted, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not: behold, our God has given judgment with retribution, and shall recompense: He will come Himself, and will save us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013698"><a href="../bible/isa025.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;25:3</a></span> Here we see, that not by ourselves, but by the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must be saved.</p>

<p>4. Again, that it should not be a mere man who should save us, nor [one] without flesh&mdash; for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are without flesh&mdash; [the same  <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>] announced, saying: <q>Neither an elder,  nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but the Lord Himself will save them because He loves them, and will spare them: He will Himself set them free.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013700"><a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;63:9</a></span> And that He should Himself become very man, visible, when He should be the Word giving <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, Isaiah again says: <q>Behold, city of Zion: your eyes shall see our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013701"><a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;33:20</a></span> And that it was not a mere man who died for us, Isaiah says: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord remembered His dead <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who had slept in the land of sepulture; and He came down to preach His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to them, that He might save them.</q>  And Amos (Micah) the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declares the same: <q>He will turn again, and will have compassion upon us: He will destroy our iniquities, and will cast our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> into the depths of the sea.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013703"><a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse9">Micah&nbsp;7:9</a></span> And again, specifying the place of His advent, he says: <q>The Lord has spoken from Zion, and He has uttered His voice from Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013704"><a href="../bible/joe003.htm#verse16">Joel&nbsp;3:16</a>; <a href="../bible/amo001.htm#verse2">Amos&nbsp;1:2</a></span> And that it is from that region which is towards the south of the inheritance of Judah that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> shall come, who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who was from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, where the Lord was born [and] will send out His praise through all the earth, thus  says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Habakkuk: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come from the south, and the Holy One from Mount Effrem. His power covered the heavens over, and the earth is full of His praise. Before His face shall go forth the Word, and His feet shall advance in the plains.</q>  Thus he indicates in clear terms that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that His advent was [to take place] in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and from Mount Effrem which is towards the south of the inheritance, and that [He is] man. For he says, <q>His feet shall advance in the plains:</q> and this is an indication proper to man. </p>
