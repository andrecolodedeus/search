<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 21)</h1>

<span class="h1a">A vindication of the prophecy in Isa. vii. 14against the misinterpretations of Theodotion, Aquila, the Ebionites, and the Jews. Authority of the Septuagint version. Arguments in proof that Christ was born of a virgin.</span>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, was made man, and the Lord did Himself save us, giving us the token of the Virgin. But not as some allege, among those now presuming to expound the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, [thus:] <q>Behold, a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall conceive, and bring forth a son,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013708"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> as Theodotion the Ephesian has interpreted, and Aquila of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>,  both Jewish proselytes. The <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, following these, assert that He was begotten by Joseph; thus destroying, as far as in them lies, such a marvellous dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and setting aside the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which proceeded from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> this prediction was uttered before the removal of the people to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>; that is, anterior to the supremacy acquired by the Medes and Persians. But it was interpreted into Greek by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves, much before the period of our Lord's advent, that there might remain no suspicion that perchance the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, complying with our humour, did put this interpretation upon these words. They indeed, had they been cognizant of our future <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and that we should use these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, would themselves never have hesitated to burn their own Scriptures, which do declare that all other nations partake of [<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>] life, and show that they who boast themselves as being the house of Jacob and the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, are disinherited from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. For before the Romans possessed their kingdom,  while as yet the Macedonians held Asia, Ptolemy the son of Lagus, being anxious to adorn the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> which he had founded in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, with a collection of the writings of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which were [works] of merit, made request to the people of Jerusalem, that they should have their Scriptures translated into the Greek language. And they&mdash; for at that time they were still subject to the Macedonians&mdash; sent to Ptolemy seventy of their elders, who were thoroughly skilled in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and in both the languages, to carry out what he had desired.  But he, wishing to test them individually, and fearing lest they might perchance, by taking counsel together, conceal the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, by their interpretation, separated them from each other, and commanded them all to write the same translation. He did this with respect to all the books. But when they came together in the same place before Ptolemy, and  each of them compared his own interpretation with that of every other, God was indeed <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> were acknowledged as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine. For all of them read out the common translation [which they had prepared] in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end, so that even the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> present perceived that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> had been interpreted by the inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  And there was nothing astonishing in God having done this&mdash;He who, when, during the captivity of the people under <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> had been corrupted, and when, after seventy years, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had returned to their own land, then, in the times of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, inspired Esdras the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, of the tribe of Levi, to recast  all the words of the former <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and to re-establish with the people the Mosaic legislation.</p>

<p>3. Since, therefore, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> have been interpreted with such fidelity, and by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and since from these God has prepared and formed again our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards His Son, and has preserved to us the unadulterated Scriptures in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where the house of Jacob flourished, fleeing from the famine in Canaan; where also our Lord was preserved when He fled from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> set on foot by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; and [since] this interpretation of these Scriptures was made prior to our Lord's descent [to earth], and came into being before the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> appeared &mdash; for our Lord was born about the forty-first year of the reign of Augustus; but Ptolemy was much earlier, under whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> were interpreted&mdash;[since these things are so, I say,] <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> these men are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be impudent and presumptuous, who would now show a desire to make different translations, when we refute them out of these Scriptures, and shut them up to a belief in the advent of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But <em>our</em> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is steadfast, unfeigned, and the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one, having clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from these Scriptures, which were interpreted in the way I have related; and the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is without interpolation. For the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, since they are of more ancient date than all these [<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>], agree with this aforesaid translation; and the translation harmonizes with the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For Peter, and John, and Matthew, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and the rest successively, as well as their followers, did set forth all prophetical [announcements], just as  the interpretation of the elders contains them.</p>

<p>4. For the one and the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, who proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> what and of what sort the advent of the Lord should be, did by these elders give a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> interpretation of what had been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> prophesied; and He did Himself, by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, announce that the fullness of the times of the adoption had arrived, that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> had drawn near, and that <em>He</em> was dwelling within those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him who was born <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> of the Virgin. To this effect they testify, [saying,] that before Joseph had come together with Mary, while she therefore remained in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, <q>she was found with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013715"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;1:18</a></span> and that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel said unto her, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you; therefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born of you shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013716"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> and that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to Joseph in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, <q>Now this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall be with child.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013717"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;1:23</a></span> But the elders have thus interpreted what Esaias said: <q>And the Lord, moreover, said unto Ahaz, Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your God out of the depth below, or from the height above. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord. And he said, It is not a small thing  for you to weary men; and how does the Lord weary them? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive, and bear a son; and you shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>. Butter and honey shall He eat: before He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> or chooses out things that are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, He shall exchange them for what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for before the child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, He shall not consent to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that He may choose that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013719"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;7:10-17</a></span> Carefully, then, has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> pointed out, by what has been said, His birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, that He is God (for the name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> indicates this). And He shows that He is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when He says, <q>Butter and honey shall He eat;</q> and in that He terms Him a child also, [in saying,] <q>before He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q> for these are all the tokens of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infant. But that He <q>will not consent to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that He may choose that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q>&mdash; this is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that by the fact, that He shall eat butter and honey, we should not understand that He is a mere man only, nor, on the other hand, from the name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, should suspect Him to be God without flesh.</p>

<p>5. And when He says, <q>Hear, O house of David,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013720"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;7:13</a></span> He performed the part of one indicating  that He whom God promised David that He would raise up from the fruit of his belly (<em>ventris</em>) an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> King, is the same who was born of the Virgin, herself of the lineage of David. For on this account also, He promised that the King should be <q>of the fruit of his <em>belly</em>,</q> which was the appropriate [term to use with respect] to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> conceiving, and not <q>of the fruit of his <em>loins</em>,</q> nor <q>of the fruit of his <em>reins</em>,</q> which expression is appropriate to a generating man, and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> conceiving by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. In this promise, therefore, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> excluded all virile influence; yet it certainly is not mentioned that He who was born was not from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man. But it has fixed and established <q>the fruit of the <em>belly</em>,</q> that it might declare the generation of Him who should be [born] from the Virgin, as <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> testified when filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, saying to Mary, <q>Blessed are you among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and blessed is the fruit of your belly;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013721"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;1:42</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> pointing out to those willing to hear, that the promise which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had made, of raising up a King from the fruit of [David's] belly, was fulfilled in the birth from the Virgin, that is, from Mary. Let those, therefore, who alter the passage of Isaiah thus, <q>Behold, a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall conceive,</q> and who will have Him to be Joseph's son, also alter the form of the promise which was given to David, when God promised him to raise up, from the fruit of his belly, the horn of Christ the King. But they did not understand, otherwise they would have presumed to alter even this passage also.</p>

<p>6. But what Isaiah said, <q>From the height above, or from the depth beneath,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013722"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;7:11</a></span> was meant to indicate, that <q>He who descended was the same also who ascended.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013723"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> But in this that he said, <q>The Lord Himself shall give you a sign,</q> he declared an unlooked-for thing with regard to His generation, which could have been accomplished in no other way than by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Lord of all, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself giving a sign in the house of David. For what great thing or what sign should have been in this, that a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> conceiving by a man should bring forth&mdash;a thing which happens to all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that produce offspring? But since an unlooked-for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was to be provided for men through the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so also was the unlooked-for birth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> accomplished; God giving this sign, but man not working it out.</p>

<p>7. On this account also, Daniel, <span class="stiki" id="note013724"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse34">Daniel&nbsp;2:34</a></span> foreseeing His advent, said that a stone, cut out without hands, came into this world. For this is what <q>without hands</q> means, that His coming into this world was not by the operation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hands, that is, of those men who are accustomed to stone-cutting; that is, Joseph taking no part with regard to it, but Mary alone co-operating with the pre-arranged plan. For this stone from the earth derives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from both the power and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore also Isaiah says: <q>Thus says the Lord, Behold, I deposit in the foundations of Zion a stone, precious, elect, the chief, the corner-one, to be had in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013725"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;28:16</a></span> So, then, we understand that His advent in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was not by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>8. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> giving a type, cast his rod upon the earth, <span class="stiki" id="note013726"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse9">Exodus&nbsp;7:9</a></span> in order that it, by becoming flesh, might expose and swallow up all the opposition of the Egyptians, which was lifting itself up against the pre-arranged plan of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note013727"><a href="../bible/exo008.htm#verse19">Exodus&nbsp;8:19</a></span> that the Egyptians themselves might testify that it is the finger of God which works <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for the people, and not the son of Joseph. For if He were the son of Joseph, how could He be greater than Solomon, or greater than Jonah, <span class="stiki" id="note013728"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;12:41-42</a></span> or greater than David, <span class="stiki" id="note013729"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse43">Matthew&nbsp;22:43</a></span> when He was generated from the same seed, and was a descendant of these men? And how was it that He also pronounced Peter blessed, because he acknowledged Him to be the Son of the living God? <span class="stiki" id="note013730"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;16:17</a></span> </p>

<p>9. But besides, if indeed He had been the son of Joseph, He could not, according to Jeremiah, be either king or heir. For Joseph is shown to be the son of Joachim and Jechoniah, as also Matthew sets forth in his pedigree. <span class="stiki" id="note013731"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;1:12-16</a></span> But Jechoniah, and all his posterity, were disinherited from the kingdom; Jeremiah thus declaring, <q>As I live, says the Lord, if Jechoniah the son of Joachim king of Judah had been made the signet of my right hand, I would pluck him thence, and deliver him into the hand of those seeking your life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013732"><a href="../bible/jer022.htm#verse24">Jeremiah&nbsp;22:24-25</a></span> And again: <q>Jechoniah is dishonoured as a useless vessel, for he has been cast into a land which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. Earth, hear the word of the Lord: Write this man a disinherited person; for none of his seed, sitting on the throne of David, shall prosper, or be a prince in Judah.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013733"><a href="../bible/jer022.htm#verse28">Jeremiah&nbsp;22:28</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And again, God speaks of Joachim his father: <q>Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Joachim his father, king of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, There shall be from him none sitting upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the heat of day, and in the frost of night. And I will look upon him, and upon  his sons, and will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, upon the land of Judah, all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that I have pronounced against them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013734"><a href="../bible/jer036.htm#verse30">Jeremiah&nbsp;36:30-31</a></span> Those, therefore, who say that He was begotten of Joseph, and that they have hope in Him, do <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> themselves to be disinherited from the kingdom, failing under the curse and rebuke directed against Jechoniah and his seed. Because for this reason have these things been spoken concerning Jechoniah, the [Holy] Spirit foreknowing the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> teachers; that they may learn that from his seed&mdash; that is, from Joseph&mdash; He was not to be born but that, according to the promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from David's belly the King <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is raised up, who sums up all things in Himself, and has gathered into Himself the ancient formation [of man]. </p>

<p>10. For as by one man's disobedience <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered, and death obtained [a place] through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so also by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of one man, righteousness having been introduced, shall <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> life to fructify in those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who in times past were dead. <span class="stiki" id="note013736"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;5:19</a></span> And as the protoplast himself Adam, had his substance from untilled and as yet virgin soil (<q>for God had not yet sent rain, and man had not tilled the ground</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013737"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;2:5</a></span>), and was formed by the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, for <q>all things were made by Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013738"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and the Lord took dust from the earth and formed man; so did He who is the Word, recapitulating <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in Himself, rightly receive a birth, enabling Him to gather up Adam [into Himself], from Mary, who was as yet a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. If, then, the first <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had a man for his father, and was born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed, it were reasonable to say that the second <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was begotten of Joseph. But if the former was taken from the dust, and God was his Maker, it was incumbent that the latter also, making a recapitulation in Himself, should be formed as man by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to have an analogy with the former as respects His origin. Why, then, did not God again take dust, but wrought so that the formation should be made of Mary? It was that there might not be another formation called into being, nor any other which should [require to] be saved, but that the very same formation should be summed up [in Christ as had <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in Adam], the analogy having been preserved.</p>
