<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 22)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Christ assumed actual flesh, conceived and born of the Virgin.</span>

<p>1. Those, therefore, who allege that He took nothing from the Virgin do greatly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, [since,] in order that they may cast away the inheritance of the flesh, they also reject the analogy [between Him and Adam]. For if the one [who sprang] from the earth had indeed formation and substance from both the hand and workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the other not from the hand and workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then He who was made after the image and likeness of the former did not, in that case, preserve the analogy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and He must seem an inconsistent piece of work, not having wherewith He may show His wisdom. But this is to say, that He also appeared putatively as man when He was not man, and that He was made man while taking nothing from man. For if He did not receive the substance of flesh from a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, He neither was made man nor the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>; and if He was not made what we were, He did no great thing in what He suffered and endured. But every one will allow that we are [composed of] a body taken from the earth, and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receiving spirit from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was made, recapitulating in Himself His own handiwork; and on this account does He confess Himself the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and blesses <q>the meek, because they shall inherit the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013739"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;5:5</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, moreover, in the Epistle to the Galatians, declares plainly, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013740"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> And again, in that to the Romans, he says, <q>Concerning His Son, who was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power, according to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013741"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;1:3-4</a></span> </p>

<p>2.  Superfluous, too, in that case is His descent into Mary; for why did He come down into her if He were to take nothing of her? Still further, if He had taken nothing of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, He would never have availed Himself of those kinds of food which are derived from the earth, by which that body which has been taken from the earth is nourished; nor would He have hungered, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> those forty days, like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, unless His body was craving after its own proper nourishment; nor, again, would John His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> have said, when writing of Him, <q>But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, being wearied with the journey, was sitting [to rest];</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013743"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;4:6</a></span> nor would David have proclaimed of Him beforehand, <q>They have added to the grief of my wounds;</q>  nor would He have wept over Lazarus, nor have sweated great drops of blood; nor have declared, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013745"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span> nor, when His side was pierced, would there  have come forth blood and water. For all these are tokens of the flesh which had been derived from the earth, which He had recapitulated in Himself, bearing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to His own handiwork.</p>

<p>3. Wherefore Luke points out that the pedigree which traces the generation of our Lord back to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> contains seventy-two generations, connecting the end with the beginning, and implying that it is He who has summed up in Himself all nations dispersed from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> downwards, and all languages and generations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, together with <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself. Hence also was <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself termed by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <q>the figure of Him that was to come,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013746"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;5:14</a></span> because the Word, the Maker of all things, had formed beforehand for Himself the future dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, connected with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; God having <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> that the first man should be of an animal nature, with this view, that he might be saved by the spiritual One. For inasmuch as He had a pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved should also be called into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, in order that the Being who saves should not exist in vain.</p>

<p>4. In accordance with this design, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary the Virgin</a> is found <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, saying, <q>Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013747"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;1:38</a></span> But Eve was disobedient; for she did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> when as yet she was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. And even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> (for in Paradise <q>they were both naked, and were not ashamed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013748"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse25">Genesis&nbsp;2:25</a></span> inasmuch as they, having been created a short time previously, had no understanding of the procreation of children: for it was necessary that they should first come to adult age,  and then multiply from that time onward), having become disobedient, was made the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death, both to herself and to the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; so also did Mary, having a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> [to her], and being nevertheless a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, by yielding <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, both to herself and the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. And on this account does the law term a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the wife of him who had <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> her, although she was as yet a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; thus indicating the back-reference from Mary to Eve, because what is joined together could not otherwise be put asunder than by inversion of the process by which these bonds of union had arisen;  so that the former ties be cancelled by the latter, that the latter may set the former again at liberty. And it has, in fact, happened that the first compact looses from the second tie, but that the second tie takes the position of the first which has been cancelled.  For this reason did the Lord declare that the first should in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be last, and the last first. <span class="stiki" id="note013752"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;19:30</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;20:16</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, too, indicates the same, saying, <q>instead of fathers, children have been born unto you.</q>  For the Lord, having been born <q>the First-begotten of the dead,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013754"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse5">Revelation&nbsp;1:5</a></span> and receiving into His bosom the ancient fathers, has regenerated them into the life of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He having been made Himself the beginning of those that live, as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> became the beginning of those who die. <span class="stiki" id="note013755"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:20-22</a></span> Wherefore also Luke, commencing the genealogy with the Lord, carried it back to Adam, indicating that it was He who regenerated them into the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of life, and not they Him. And thus also it was that the knot of Eve's disobedience was loosed by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>
