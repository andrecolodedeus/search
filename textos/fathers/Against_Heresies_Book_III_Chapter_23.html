<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 23)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Arguments in opposition to Tatian, showing that it was consonant to divine justice and mercy that the first Adam should first partake in that salvation offered to all by Christ.</span>

<p>1. It was necessary, therefore, that the Lord, coming to the lost sheep, and making recapitulation of so comprehensive a dispensation, and seeking after His own handiwork, should save that very man who had been created after His image and likeness, that is, Adam, filling up the times of His condemnation, which had been incurred through disobedience&mdash;[times] <q>which the Father had placed in His own power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013756"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;1:7</a></span> [This was necessary,] too, inasmuch as the whole economy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> regarding man came to pass according to the good pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in order that God might not be conquered, nor His wisdom lessened, [in the estimation of His creatures.] For if man, who had been created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that he might live, after losing life, through being injured by the serpent that had corrupted him, should not any more return to life, but should be utterly [and for ever] abandoned to death, God would [in that case] have been conquered, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the serpent would have prevailed over the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But inasmuch as God is invincible and long-suffering, He did indeed show Himself to be long-suffering in the matter of the correction of man and the probation of all, as I have already  observed; and by means of the second man did He bind the strong man, and spoiled his goods, <span class="stiki" id="note013757"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;12:29</a></span> and abolished death, vivifying that man who had been in a state of death. For at the first <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> became a vessel in his (<a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a>) possession, whom he did also hold under his power, that is, by bringing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on him iniquitously, and under colour of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> entailing death upon him. For, while promising that they should be as gods, which was in no way possible for him to be, he wrought death in them: wherefore he who had led man captive, was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> captured in his turn by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but man, who had been led captive, was loosed from the bonds of condemnation.</p>

<p>2. But this is Adam, if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be told, the first formed man, of whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that the Lord spoke, <q>Let Us make man after Our own image and likeness;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013758"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> and we are all from him: and as we are from him, therefore have we all inherited his title. But inasmuch as man is saved, it is fitting that he who was created the original man should be saved. For it is too absurd to maintain, that he who was so deeply injured by the enemy, and was the first to suffer captivity, was not rescued by Him who conquered the enemy, but that his children were, &mdash; those whom he had begotten in the same captivity. Neither would the enemy appear to be as yet conquered, if the old spoils remained with him. To give an illustration: If a hostile force had overcome certain [enemies], had bound them, and led them away captive, and held them for a long time in servitude, so that they begot children among them; and somebody, compassionating those who had been made slaves, should overcome this same hostile force; he certainly would not act equitably, were he to liberate the children of those who had been led captive, from the sway of those who had enslaved their fathers, but should leave these latter, who had suffered the act of capture, subject to their enemies&mdash;those, too, on whose very account he had proceeded to this retaliation&mdash;the children succeeding to liberty through the avenging of their fathers' <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but not  so that their fathers, who suffered the act of capture itself, should be left [in bondage]. For God is neither devoid of power nor of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, who has afforded help to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and restored him to His own liberty.</p>

<p>3. It was for this reason, too, that immediately after <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had transgressed, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> relates, He pronounced no curse against <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> personally, but against the ground, in reference to his works, as a certain person among the ancients has observed: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did indeed transfer the curse to the earth, that it might not remain in man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013760"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;3:16</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> But man received, as the punishment of his transgression, the toilsome task of tilling the earth, and to eat bread in the sweat of his face, and to return to the dust from whence he was taken. Similarly also did the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> [receive] toil, and labour, and groans, and the pangs of parturition, and a state of subjection, that is, that she should serve her husband; so that they should neither perish altogether when cursed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor, by remaining unreprimanded, should be led to despise God. But the curse in all its fullness fell upon the serpent, which had beguiled them. <q>And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> it is declared, <q>said to the serpent: Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above all the beasts of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013761"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;3:14</a></span> And this same thing does the Lord also say in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, to those who are found upon the left hand: <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, which my Father has prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>;</q>  indicating that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> was not originally prepared for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but for him who beguiled man, and caused him to offend&mdash; for him, I say, who is chief of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, and for those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who became <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> along with him; which [fire], indeed, they too shall <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> feel, who, like him, persevere in works of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, without repentance, and without retracing their steps.</p>

<p>4. [These act]  as Cain [did, who], when he was counselled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to keep quiet, because he had not made an equitable division of that share to which his brother was entitled, but with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> thought that he could domineer over him, not only did not acquiesce, but even added <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, indicating his state of mind by his action. For what he had planned, that did he also put in practice: he tyrannized over and slew him; God subjecting the just to the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, that the former might be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> as the just one by the things which he suffered, and the latter detected as the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> by those which he perpetrated. And he was not softened even by this, nor did he stop short with that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a>; but being asked where his brother was, he said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; am I my brother's keeper?</q> extending and aggravating [his] <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by his answer. For if it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to slay a brother, much worse is it thus insolently and irreverently to reply to the omniscient God as if he could battle Him. And for this he did himself bear a curse about with him, because he gratuitously brought  an offering of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, having had no reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor being put to confusion by the act of fratricide. </p>

<p>5. The case of Adam, however, had no analogy with this, but was altogether different. For, having been beguiled by another under the pretext of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, he is immediately seized with terror, and hides himself; not as if he were able to escape from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but, in a state of confusion at having transgressed His command, he feels unworthy to appear before and to hold converse with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, <q>the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013765"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse7">Proverbs&nbsp;1:7</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;9:10</a></span> the sense of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> leads to repentance, and God bestows His compassion upon those who are penitent. For [Adam] showed his repentance by his conduct, through means of the girdle [which he used], covering himself with fig-leaves, while there were many other leaves, which would have irritated his body in a less degree. He, however, adopted a dress conformable to his disobedience, being awed by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and resisting the erring, the lustful propensity of his flesh (since he had lost his natural disposition and child-like <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and had come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things), he girded a bridle of continence upon himself and his wife, fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and waiting for His coming, and indicating, as it were, some such thing [as follows]: Inasmuch as, he says, I have by disobedience lost that robe of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> which I had from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, I do now also acknowledge that I am deserving of a covering of this nature, which affords no gratification, but which gnaws and frets the body. And he would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have retained this clothing for ever, thus humbling himself, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is merciful, had not clothed them with tunics of skins instead of fig-leaves. For this purpose, too, He interrogates them, that the blame might light upon the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; and again, He interrogates her, that she might convey the blame to the serpent. For she related what had occurred. <q>The serpent,</q> says she, <q>beguiled me, and I ate.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013766"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse13">Genesis&nbsp;3:13</a></span> But He put no question to the serpent; for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he had been the prime mover in the guilty deed; but He pronounced the curse upon him in the first instance, that it might fall upon man with a mitigated rebuke. For God detested him who had led man astray, but by degrees, and little by little, He showed compassion to him who had been beguiled.</p>

<p>6. Wherefore also He drove him out of Paradise, and removed him far from the tree of life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as some venture to assert, but because He pitied him, [and did not desire] that he should continue a sinner for ever, nor that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which surrounded him should be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> interminable and irremediable. But He set a bound to his [state of] <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by interposing death, and thus causing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to cease, <span class="stiki" id="note013767"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;6:7</a></span> putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh, which should take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at length to live to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and dying to it, might begin to live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>7. For this end did He put enmity between the serpent and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her seed, they keeping it up mutually: He, the sole of whose foot should be bitten, having power also to tread upon the enemy's head; but the other biting, killing, and impeding the steps of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, until the seed did come appointed to tread down his head&mdash;which was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, of whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaks: <q>You shall tread upon the asp and the basilisk; you shall trample down the lion and the dragon;</q> &mdash; indicating that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which was set up and spread out against man, and which rendered him subject to death, should be deprived of its power, along with death, which rules [over men]; and that the lion, that is, antichrist, rampant against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in the latter days, should be trampled down by Him; and that He should bind <q>the dragon, that old serpent</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013769"><a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse2">Revelation&nbsp;20:2</a></span> and subject him to the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who had been conquered <span class="stiki" id="note013770"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;10:19</a></span> so that all his might should be trodden down. Now <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had been conquered, all life having been taken away from him: wherefore, when the foe was conquered in his turn, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> received new life; and the last enemy, death, is destroyed, <span class="stiki" id="note013771"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:26</a></span> which at the first had taken possession of man. Therefore, when man has been liberated, <q>what is written shall come to pass, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your sting?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013772"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:54-55</a></span> This could not be said with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if that man, over whom death did first obtain dominion, were not set free. For his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is death's destruction. When therefore the Lord vivifies man, that is, Adam, death is at the same time destroyed.</p>

<p>8. All therefore speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> who disallow his (Adam's) <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, shutting themselves out from life for ever, in that they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the sheep which had perished has been found. <span class="stiki" id="note013773"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;15:4</a></span> For if it has not been found, the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is still held in a state of perdition. False, therefore, is that, man who first started this idea, or rather, this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and blindness&mdash; <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>.   As I have already indicated, this man entangled himself with all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.  This dogma, however, has been invented by himself, in order that, by introducing something new, independently of the rest, and by speaking vanity, he might acquire for himself hearers void of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, affecting to be esteemed a teacher, and endeavouring from time to time to employ sayings of this kind often [made use of] by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: <q>In <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> we all die;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013776"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, however, that <q>where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did much more abound.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013777"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> Since this, then, has been clearly shown, let all his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> be put to shame, and let them wrangle  about Adam, as if some great gain were to accrue to them if he be not saved; when they profit nothing more [by that], even as the serpent also did not profit when persuading man [to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>], except to this effect, that he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> him a transgressor, obtaining man as the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>.  But he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God's power.  Thus also do those who disallow Adam's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> gain nothing, except this, that they render themselves <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and show themselves patrons of the serpent and of death.</p>
