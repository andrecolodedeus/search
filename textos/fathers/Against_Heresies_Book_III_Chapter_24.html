<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 24)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Recapitulation of the various arguments adduced against Gnostic impiety under all its aspects. The heretics, tossed about by every blast of doctrine, are opposed by the uniform teaching of the Church, which remains so always, and is consistent with itself.</span>

<p>1. Thus, then, have all these men been exposed, who bring in impious doctrines regarding our Maker and Framer, who also formed this world, and above whom there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and those have been overthrown by their own arguments who teach falsehoods regarding the substance of our Lord, and the dispensation which He fulfilled for the sake of His own creature man. But [it has, on the other hand, been shown], that the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is everywhere consistent, and continues in an even course, and receives testimony from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>&mdash; as I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>&mdash; through [those in] the beginning, the middle, and the end,  and through the entire dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that well-grounded system which tends  to man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, namely, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; which, having been received from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we do preserve, and which always, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, renewing its youth, as if it were some precious deposit in an excellent vessel, causes the vessel itself containing it to renew its youth also. For this gift of God has been entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as breath was to the first created man,  for this purpose, that all the members receiving it may be vivified; and the [means of] communion with Christ has been distributed throughout it, that is, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the earnest of incorruption, the means of confirming our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the ladder of ascent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,</q> it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has set <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, teachers,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013784"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:28</a></span> and all the other means through which the Spirit works; of which all those are not partakers who do not join themselves to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but defraud themselves of life through their perverse opinions and <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> behaviour. For where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is, there is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; and where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is, there is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and every kind of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Those, therefore, who do not partake of Him, are neither nourished into life from the mother's breasts, nor do they enjoy that most limpid fountain which issues from the body of Christ; but they dig for themselves broken cisterns <span class="stiki" id="note013785"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> out of earthly trenches, and drink putrid water out of the mire, fleeing from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lest they be convicted; and rejecting the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that they may not be instructed.</p>

<p>2. Alienated thus from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they do deservedly wallow in all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, tossed to and fro by it, thinking differently in regard to the same things at different times, and never attaining to a well-grounded <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, being more anxious to be sophists of words than <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For they have not been founded upon the one rock, but upon the sand, which has in itself a multitude of stones. Wherefore they also <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> many gods, and they always have the excuse of searching [after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>] (for they are blind), but never succeed in finding it. For they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Creator, Him who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who also furnishes power to find [the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>]; imagining that they have discovered another god beyond <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or another Pleroma, or another dispensation. Wherefore also the light which is from God does not illumine them, because they have dishonoured and despised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, holding Him of small account, because, through His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> benignity, He has come within reach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, however, not with regard to His greatness, or with regard to His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>&mdash; for that has no  man measured or handled&mdash; but after this sort: that we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He who made, and formed, and breathed in them the breath of life, and nourishes us by means of the creation, establishing all things by His Word, and binding them together by His Wisdom &mdash; this is He who is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God); but they dream of a non-existent being above Him, that they may be regarded as having found out the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom nobody, [they hold,] can recognise holding communication with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, or as directing mundane matters: that is to say, they find out the god of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, who does nothing either for himself or others; that is, he exercises no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> at all.</p>
