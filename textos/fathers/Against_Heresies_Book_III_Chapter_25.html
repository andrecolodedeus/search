<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 25)</h1>

<span class="h1a">This world is ruled by the providence of one God, who is both endowed with infinite justice to punish the wicked, and with infinite goodness to bless the pious, and impart to them salvation.</span>

<p>1. God does, however, exercise a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over all things, and therefore He also gives counsel; and when giving counsel, He is present with those who attend to moral discipline.  It follows then of course, that the things which are watched over and governed should be acquainted with their ruler; which things are not irrational or vain, but they have understanding derived from the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, for this reason certain of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who were less addicted to [sensual] allurements and voluptuousness, and were not led away to such a degree of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> with regard to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, being moved, though but slightly, by His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, were nevertheless convinced that they should call the Maker of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who exercises a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over all things, and arranges the affairs of our world.</p>

<p>2. Again, that they might remove the rebuking and judicial power from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, reckoning that as unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thinking that they had found out a God both without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and [merely] good, they have alleged that one [God] judges, but that another saves, unconsciously taking away the intelligence and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of both deities. For if the judicial one is not also good, to bestow favours upon the deserving, and to direct reproofs against those requiring them, he will appear neither a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> nor a wise judge. On the other hand, the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if he is merely good, and not one who tests those upon whom he shall send his goodness, will be out of the range of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and goodness; and his goodness will seem imperfect, as not saving all; [for it should do so,] if it be not accompanied with judgment.</p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, therefore, himself, by dividing God into two, maintaining one to be good and the other judicial, does in fact, on both sides, put an end to deity. For he that is the judicial one, if he be not good, is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because he from whom goodness is absent is no God at all; and again, he who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if he has no judicial power, suffers the same [loss] as the former, by being deprived of his character of deity. And how can they call the Father of all wise, if they do not assign to Him a judicial faculty? For if He is wise, He is also one who tests [others]; but the judicial power belongs to him who tests, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> follows the judicial faculty, that it may reach a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> conclusion; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> calls forth judgment, and judgment, when it is executed with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, will pass on to wisdom. Therefore the Father will excel in wisdom all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and angelic wisdom, because He is Lord, and Judge, and the Just One, and Ruler over all. For He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and merciful, and patient, and saves whom He ought: nor does goodness desert Him in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>,  nor is His wisdom lessened; for He saves those whom He should save, and judges those worthy of judgment. Neither does He show Himself unmercifully just; for His goodness, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, goes on before, and takes precedency.</p>

<p>4. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, who does benevolently <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> His sun to rise upon all, <span class="stiki" id="note013789"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> and sends rain upon the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, shall judge those who, enjoying His equally distributed kindness, have led lives not corresponding to the dignity of His bounty; but who have spent their days in wantonness and luxury, in opposition to His benevolence, and have, moreover, even <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> Him who has conferred so great benefits upon them.</p>

<p>5. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and Himself executing judgment, expressing himself thus, <q>And God indeed, as He is also the ancient Word, possessing the beginning, the end, and the mean of all existing things, does everything rightly, moving round about them according to their nature; but retributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> always follows Him against those who depart from the divine law.</q>  Then, again, he points out that the Maker and Framer of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. <q>And to the good,</q> he says, <q>no <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> ever springs up with regard to anything;</q>  thus establishing the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the beginning and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the creation of the world, but not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, nor an erring <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, nor the  consequence of a defect, nor the Mother weeping and lamenting, nor another God or Father.</p>

<p>6. Well may their Mother bewail them, as capable of conceiving and inventing such things for they have worthily uttered this <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> against themselves, that their Mother is beyond the Pleroma, that is beyond the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that their entire multitude became  a shapeless and crude <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a>: for it apprehends nothing of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; it falls into void and darkness: for their wisdom (<em>Sophia</em>) was void, and wrapped up in darkness; and Horos did not permit her to enter the Pleroma: for the Spirit (Achamoth) did not receive them into the place of refreshment. For their father, by begetting <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, wrought in them the sufferings of death. We do not misrepresent [their opinions on] these points; but they do themselves confirm, they do themselves teach, they do <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in them, they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a lofty [<a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>] about their Mother, whom they represent as having been begotten without a father, that is, without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a female from a female,  that is, corruption from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>7. We do indeed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that these men may not remain in the pit which they themselves have dug, but separate themselves from a Mother of this nature, and depart from Bythus, and stand away from the void, and relinquish the shadow; and that they, being converted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, may be lawfully begotten, and that Christ may be formed in them, and that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Framer and Maker of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and Lord of all. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for these things on their behalf, loving them better than they seem to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> themselves. For our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, inasmuch as it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is salutary to them, if they will but receive it. It may be compared to a severe remedy, extirpating the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and sloughing flesh of a wound; for it puts an end to their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and haughtiness. Wherefore it shall not weary us, to endeavour with all our might to stretch out the hand unto them. Over and above what has been already stated, I have deferred to the following book, to adduce the words of the Lord; if, by convincing some among them, through means of the very instruction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I may succeed in persuading them to abandon such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to cease from <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> their Creator, who is both God alone, and the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
