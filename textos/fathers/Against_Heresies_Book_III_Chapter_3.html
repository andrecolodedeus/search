<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 3)</h1>

<span class="h1a">A refutation of the heretics, from the fact that, in the various Churches, a perpetual succession of bishops was kept up.</span>

<p>1. It is within the power of all, therefore, in every <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who may wish to see the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to contemplate clearly the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> manifested throughout the whole world; and we are in a position to reckon up those who were by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> instituted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, and [to demonstrate] the succession of these men to our own times; those who neither taught nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of anything like what these [<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>] rave about. For if the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, which they were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of imparting to <q>the perfect</q> apart and privily from the rest, they would have delivered them especially to those to whom they were also committing the Churches themselves. For they were desirous that these men should be very perfect and blameless in all things, whom also they were leaving behind as their successors, delivering up their own place of government to these men; which men, if they discharged their functions honestly, would be a great boon [to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>], but if they should fall away, the direst calamity.</p>

<p>2. Since, however, it would be very tedious, in such a volume as this, to reckon up the successions of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, we do put to confusion all those who, in whatever manner, whether by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by blindness and perverse opinion, assemble in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, I say,] by indicating that tradition derived from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, of the very great, the very ancient, and universally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded and organized at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the two most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; as also [by pointing out] the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> preached to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For it is a matter of necessity that every <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should agree with this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on account of its preeminent authority,  that is, the faithful everywhere,  inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> tradition has been preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist everywhere.</p>

<p>3. The blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, then, having founded and built up the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. Of this Linus, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> makes mention in the Epistles to Timothy. To him succeeded Anacletus; and after him, in the third place from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Clement was allotted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>. This man, as he had seen the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and had been conversant with them, might be said to have the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> still echoing [in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes. Nor was he alone [in this], for there were many still remaining who had received instructions from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. In the time of this Clement, no small dissension having occurred among the brethren at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Rome dispatched a most powerful letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them to peace, renewing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, proclaiming the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, the Maker of heaven and earth, the Creator of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who brought on the deluge, and called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who led the people from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, spoke with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, set forth the law, sent the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and who has prepared fire for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. From this document, whosoever chooses to do so, may learn that He, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, was preached by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, and may also understand the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since this Epistle is of older date than these men who are now propagating <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and who conjure into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> another god beyond the Creator and the Maker of all existing things. To this Clement there succeeded Evaristus. Alexander followed Evaristus; then, sixth from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Sixtus was appointed; after him, Telephorus, who was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>; then <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>; after him, <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a>; then after him, <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>. <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Soter</a> having succeeded <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>, <a href="../cathen/05378a.htm">Eleutherius</a> does now, in the twelfth place from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, hold the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. In this order, and by this succession, the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, have come down to us. And this is most abundant <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that there is one and the same vivifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which has been preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> until now, and handed down in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>4. But <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> also was not only instructed by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and conversed with many who had seen Christ, but was also, by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in Asia, appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, whom I also saw in my early youth, for he tarried [on earth] a very long time, and, when a very old man, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> and most nobly suffering <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>,  departed this life, having always taught the things which he had learned from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has handed down, and which alone are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. To these things all the Asiatic Churches testify, as do also those men who have succeeded <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> down to the present time,&mdash; a man who was of much greater weight, and a more steadfast <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, than <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. He it was who, coming to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> caused many to turn away from the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, proclaiming that he had received this one and sole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>&mdash;that, namely, which is handed down by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  There are also those who heard from him that John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord, going to bathe at <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, and perceiving <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> within, rushed out of the bath-house without bathing, exclaiming, <q>Let us fly, lest even the bath-house fall down, because <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is within.</q> And <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> himself replied to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, who met him on one occasion, and said, <q>Do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me?</q> <q>I do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.</q> Such was the horror which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had against holding even verbal communication with any corrupters of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says, <q>A man that is an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, after the first and second admonition, reject; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he that is such is subverted, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, being condemned of himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013316"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;3:10</a></span> There is also a very powerful  Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians, from which those who choose to do so, and are anxious about their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, can learn the character of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Then, again, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and having John remaining among them permanently until the times of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>
