<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 4)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The truth is to be found nowhere else but in the Catholic Church, the sole depository of apostolic doctrine. Heresies are of recent formation, and cannot trace their origin up to the apostles.</span>

<p>1. Since therefore we have such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, it is not necessary to seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> among others which it is easy to obtain from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; since the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, like a rich man [depositing his money] in a bank, lodged in her hands most copiously all things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: so that every man, whosoever will, can draw from her the  water of life. <span class="stiki" id="note013318"><a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse17">Revelation&nbsp;22:17</a></span> For she is the entrance to life; all others are thieves and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. On this account are we bound to avoid <em>them</em>, but to make choice of the thing pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the utmost diligence, and to lay hold of the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For how stands the case? Suppose there arise a dispute relative to some important question  among us, should we not have recourse to the most ancient Churches with which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> held constant intercourse, and learn from them what is certain and clear in regard to the present question? For how should it be if the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves had not left us writings? Would it not be necessary, [in that case,] to follow the course of the tradition which they handed down to those to whom they did commit the Churches?</p>

<p>2. To which course many nations of those barbarians who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ do assent, having <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> written in their hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, without paper or ink, and, carefully preserving the ancient tradition,  believing in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of heaven and earth, and all things therein, by means of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; who, because of His surpassing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards His creation, condescended to be born of the virgin, He Himself uniting man through Himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having suffered under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, and rising again, and having been received up in splendour, shall come in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the Saviour of those who are saved, and the Judge of those who are judged, and sending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> those who transform the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and despise His Father and His advent. Those who, in the absence of written documents,  have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are barbarians, so far as regards our language; but as regards doctrine, manner, and tenor of life, they are, because of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, very wise indeed; and they do please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ordering their conversation in all righteousness, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and wisdom. If any one were to preach to these men the inventions of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, speaking to them in their own language, they would at once stop their ears, and flee as far off as possible, not enduring even to listen to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> address. Thus, by means of that ancient tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, they do not suffer their mind to conceive anything of the [doctrines suggested by the] portentous language of these teachers, among whom neither <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nor doctrine has ever been established.</p>

<p>3. For, prior to <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, those who follow <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; nor did those from <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> exist before <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>; nor, in short, had any of those malignant-minded people, whom I have above enumerated, any being previous to the initiators and inventors of their perversity. For <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>, flourished under <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a>, and remained until <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>. Cerdon, too, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> predecessor, himself arrived in the time of <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>, who was the ninth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.  Coming frequently into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and making public confession, he thus remained, one time teaching in secret, and then again making public confession; but at last, having been denounced for corrupt teaching, he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>  from the assembly of the brethren. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, then, succeeding him, flourished under <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>, who held the tenth place of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. But the rest, who are called <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, take rise from Menander, Simon's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, as I have shown; and each one of them appeared to be both the father and the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of that doctrine into which he has been initiated. But all these (the Marcosians) broke out into their <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> much later, even during the intermediate period of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
