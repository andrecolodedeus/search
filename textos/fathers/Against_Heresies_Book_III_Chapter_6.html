<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 6)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The Holy Ghost, throughout the Old Testament Scriptures, made mention of no other God or Lord, save him who is the true God.</span>

<p>1. Therefore neither would the Lord, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, have ever named as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, definitely and absolutely, him who was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless he were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor would they have named any one in his own person Lord, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father ruling over all, and His Son who has received dominion from His Father over all creation, as this passage has it: <q>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool.</q>  Here the [Scripture] represents to us the Father addressing the Son; He who gave Him the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and subjected to Him all His enemies. Since, therefore, the Father is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Lord, and the Son <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Lord, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has fitly designated them by the title of Lord. And again, referring to the destruction of the Sodomites, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Then the Lord rained upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013330"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;19:24</a></span> For it here points out that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who had also been talking with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, had received power to judge the Sodomites  for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And this [text following] does declare the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: <q>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Your kingdom is a right sceptre. You have loved righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity: therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You.</q>  For the Spirit designates both [of them] by the name, of God&mdash; both Him who is anointed as Son, and Him who does anoint, that is, the Father. And again: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stood in the congregation of the gods, He judges among the gods.</q>  He [here] refers to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and those who have received the adoption; but these are the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For she is the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash; that is, the Son Himself&mdash; has gathered by Himself. Of whom He again speaks: <q>The God of gods, the Lord has spoken, and has called the earth.</q>  Who is meant by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? He of whom He has said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come openly, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall not keep silence;</q>  that is, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who came manifested to men who said, <q>I have openly appeared to those who seek Me not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013335"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;65:1</a></span> But of what gods [does he speak]? [Of those] to whom He says, <q>I have said, You are gods, and all sons of the Most High.</q>  To those, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, who have received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <q>adoption, by which we cry, Abba Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013337"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;8:15</a></span> </p>

<p>2. Wherefore, as I have already stated, no other is named as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or is called Lord, except Him who is God and Lord of all, who also said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>I am that I am. And thus shall you say to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: He who is, has sent me unto you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013338"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> and His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, who makes those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His name the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And again, when the Son speaks to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, He says, <q>I have come down to deliver this people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013339"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;3:8</a></span> For it is He who descended and ascended for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men. Therefore God has been declared through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has the Father in Himself &mdash; He who is, the Father bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son announcing the Father.&mdash; As also Esaias says, <q>I too am <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>,</q> he declares, <q>says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and the Son whom I have chosen, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and understand that I am.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013340"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;43:10</a></span> </p>

<p>3. When, however, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> terms them [gods] which are no gods, it does not, as I have already remarked, declare them as gods in every sense, but with a certain addition and signification, by which they are shown to be no gods at all. As with David: <q>The gods of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>;</q>  and, <q>You shall not follow other gods.</q>  For in that he says <q>the gods of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a></q>&mdash; but the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God&mdash; and calls them <q>other gods,</q> he bars their claim [to be looked upon] as gods at all. But as to what they are in their own person, he speaks concerning them; <q>for they are,</q> he says, <q>the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q> And Esaias: <q>Let them be confounded, all who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and carve useless things;  even I am <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, says God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013344"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;44:9</a></span> He removes them from [the category of] gods, but he makes use of the word alone, for this [purpose], that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of whom he speaks. Jeremiah also says the same: <q>The gods that have not made the heavens and earth, let them perish from the earth which is under the heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013345"><a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;10:11</a></span> For, from the fact of his having subjoined their destruction, he shows them to be no gods at all. Elias, too, when all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was assembled at Mount Carmel, wishing to turn them from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, says to them, <q>How long do you halt between two opinions?  If the Lord be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  follow Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013348"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;18:21</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And again, at the burnt-offering, he thus addresses the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: <q>You shall call upon the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Lord that will hearken by fire,  He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Now, from the fact of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> having said these words, he proves that these gods which were reputed so among those men, are no gods at all. He directed them to that God upon whom he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and who was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whom invoking, he exclaimed, <q>Lord God of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, hear me today, and let all this people <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You are the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013350"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse36">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;18:36</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Wherefore I do also call upon you, Lord God of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who is the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the God who, through the abundance of Your mercy, has  had a favour towards us, that we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, who has  made heaven and earth, who rule over all, who is the only and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, above whom there is none other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; grant, by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the governing power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; give to every reader of this book to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, that You are God alone, to be strengthened in You, and to avoid every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and godless, and impious doctrine.</p>

<p>  5. And the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also, saying, <q>For though you have served them which are no gods; you now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or rather, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013351"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;4:8-9</a></span> has made a separation between those that were not [gods] and Him who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And again, speaking of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, he says, <q>who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that is worshipped.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013352"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> He points out here those who are called gods, by such as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. For the Father of all is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is so; and <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> shall be lifted up, not above Him, but above those which are indeed called gods, but are not. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself says that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an idol is nothing, and that there is none other God but one. For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth; yet to us there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom are all things, and we through Him; and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom are all things, and we by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013353"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:4</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> For he has made a distinction, and separated those which are indeed called gods, but which are none, from the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from whom are all things, and, he has confessed in the most decided manner in his own person, one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. But in this [clause], <q>whether in heaven or in earth,</q> he does not speak of the formers of the world, as these [teachers] expound it; but his meaning is similar to that of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when it is said, <q>You shall not make to yourself any image for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whatsoever things are in heaven above, whatsoever in the earth beneath, and whatsoever in the waters under the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013354"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:8</a></span> And he does thus explain what are meant by the things in heaven: <q>Lest when,</q> he says, <q>looking towards heaven, and observing the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and all the ornament of heaven, falling into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, you should adore and serve them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013355"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:19</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself, being a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was indeed given as a god before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note013356"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;7:1</a></span> but he is not properly termed Lord, nor is called God by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but is spoken of by the Spirit as <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the faithful minister and servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013357"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse5">Hebrews&nbsp;3:5</a>; <a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse7">Numbers&nbsp;12:7</a></span> which also he was.</p>
