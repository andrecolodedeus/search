<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 7)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Reply to an objection founded on the words of St. Paul (2 Cor. iv. 4). St. Paul occasionally uses words not in their grammatical sequence.</span>

<p>1. As to their affirming that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said plainly in the Second [Epistle] to the Corinthians, <q>In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013358"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> and maintaining that there is indeed one god of this world, but another who is beyond all principality, and beginning, and power, we are not to blame if they, who give out that they do themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> beyond <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to read <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. For if any one read the passage thus&mdash; according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> custom, as I show elsewhere, and by many examples, that he uses transposition of words&mdash; <q>In whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> then pointing it off, and making a slight interval, and at the same time read also the rest [of the sentence] in one [clause], <q>has blinded the minds of them of this world that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not,</q> he shall find out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> [sense]; that it is contained in the expression, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has blinded the minds of the unbelievers of this world.</q> And this is shown by means of the little interval [between the clause]. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does not say, <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of this world,</q> as if recognising any other beyond Him; but he confessed God as indeed God. And he says, <q>the unbelievers of this world,</q> because they shall not inherit the future age of incorruption. I shall show from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself, how it is that God has blinded the minds of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, in the course of this work, that we may not just at present distract our mind from the matter in hand, [by wandering] at large.</p>

<p>2. From many other instances also, we may discover that the apostle frequently uses a transposed order in his sentences, due to the rapidity of his discourses, and the impetus of the Spirit which is in him. An example occurs in the [Epistle] to the Galatians, where he expresses himself as follows: <q>Wherefore then the law of works?  It was added, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the hand of a Mediator.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013360"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> For the order of the words runs thus: <q>Wherefore then the law of works? Ordained by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the hand of a Mediator, it was added until the seed should come to whom the promise was made,</q>&mdash; man thus asking the question, and the Spirit making answer. And again, in the Second to the Thessalonians, speaking of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, he says, <q>And then shall that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> be revealed, whom the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>  shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy him  with the presence of his coming; [even him] whose coming is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013363"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Now in these [sentences] the order of the words is this: <q>And then shall be revealed that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, whose coming is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, whom  the Lord Jesus shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the presence of His coming.</q> For he does not mean that the coming of the Lord is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; but the coming of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, whom we also call <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. If, then, one does not attend to the [proper] reading [of the passage], and if he do not exhibit the intervals of breathing as they occur, there shall be not only incongruities, but also, when reading, he will utter <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, as if the advent of the Lord could take place according to the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. So therefore, in such passages, the <em>hyperbaton</em> must be exhibited by the reading, and the apostle's meaning following on, preserved; and thus we do not read in that passage, <q>the god of this world,</q> but, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> whom we do <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and we hear [it declared of] the unbelieving and the blinded of this world, that they shall not inherit the world of life which is to come.</p>
