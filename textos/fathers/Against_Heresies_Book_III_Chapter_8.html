<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 8)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Answer to an objection, arising from the words of Christ (Matt. vi. 24). God alone is to be really called God and Lord, for He is without beginning and end.</span>

<p>1. This <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, then, of these men, having been quashed, it is clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that neither the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did ever name another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or call [him] Lord, except the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only God. Much more [would this be the case with regard to] the Lord Himself, who did also direct us to <q>render unto C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's, and to God the things that are God's;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013364"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;22:21</a></span> naming indeed C&aelig;sar as C&aelig;sar, but confessing God as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In like manner also, that [text] which says, <q>You cannot serve two masters,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013365"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> He does Himself interpret, saying, <q>You cannot serve God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>;</q> acknowledging God indeed as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but mentioning <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, a thing having also an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. He does not call <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> Lord when He says, <q>You cannot serve two masters;</q> but He teaches His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not to be subject to <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, nor to be ruled by it. For He says, <q>He that commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the slave of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013366"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;8:34</a></span> Inasmuch, then, as He terms those <q>the slaves of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> who serve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but does not certainly call <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thus also He terms those who serve <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> <q>the slaves of <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>,</q> not calling <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> God. For <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> is, according to the Jewish language, which the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> do also use, a <em><a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a></em> man, and one who wishes to have more than he ought to have. But according to the Hebrew, it is by the addition of a syllable (<em>adjunctive</em>) called Mamuel,  and signifies <em>gulosum</em>, that is, one whose gullet is insatiable. Therefore, according to both these things which are indicated, we cannot serve God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>.</p>

<p>2. But also, when He spoke of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> as strong, not absolutely so, but as in comparison with us, the Lord showed Himself under every aspect and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to be the strong man, saying that one can in no other way <q>spoil the goods of a strong man, if he do not first bind the strong man himself, and then he will spoil his house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013368"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;12:29</a></span> Now we were the vessels and the house of this [strong man] when we were in a state of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>; for he put us to whatever use he pleased, and the unclean spirit dwelt within us. For he was not strong, as opposed to Him who bound him, and spoiled his house; but as against those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were his tools, inasmuch as he caused their thought to wander away from God: these did the Lord snatch from his grasp. As also Jeremiah declares, <q>The Lord has redeemed Jacob, and has snatched him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013369"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:11</a></span> If, then, he had not pointed out Him who binds and spoils his goods, but had merely spoken of him as being strong, the strong man should have been unconquered. But he also subjoined Him who obtains and retains possession; for <em>he</em> holds who binds, but <em>he is</em> held who is bound. And this he did without any comparison, so that, <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> slave as he was, he might not be compared to the Lord: for not he alone, but not one of created and subject things, shall ever be compared to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, by whom all things were made, who is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>3. For that all things, whether Angels, or Archangels, or Thrones, or Dominions, were both established and created by Him who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all, through His Word, John has thus pointed out. For when he had spoken of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> as having been in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he added, <q>All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013370"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> David also, when he had enumerated [His] praises, subjoins by name all things whatsoever I have mentioned, both the heavens and all the powers therein: <q>For He commanded, and they were created; He spoke, and they were made.</q> Whom, therefore, did He command? The Word, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, <q>by whom,</q> he says, <q>the heavens were established, and all their power by the breath of His mouth.</q>  But that He did Himself  make all things freely, and as He pleased, again David says, <q>But our God is in the heavens above, and in the earth; He has made all things whatsoever He pleased.</q>  But the things established are distinct from Him who has established them, and what have been made from Him who has made them. For He is Himself uncreated, both without beginning and end, and lacking nothing. He is Himself sufficient for Himself; and still further, He grants to all others this very thing, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; but the things which have been made by Him have received a beginning. But whatever things had a beginning, and are liable to dissolution, and are subject to and stand in need of Him who made them, must necessarily in all respects have a different term [applied to them], even by those who have but a moderate capacity for discerning such things; so that He indeed who made all things can alone, together with His Word, properly be termed God and Lord: but the things which have been made cannot have this term applied to them, neither should they <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> assume that appellation which belongs to the Creator.</p>
