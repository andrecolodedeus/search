<h1>Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 9)</h1>

<span class="h1a">One and the same God, the Creator of heaven and earth, is He whom the prophets foretold, and who was declared by the Gospel. Proof of this, at the outset, from St. Matthew's Gospel.</span>

<p>1. This, therefore, having been clearly demonstrated here (and it shall yet be so still more clearly), that neither the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, nor the Lord Christ in His own person, did acknowledge any other Lord or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the God and Lord supreme: the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> confessing the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; but naming no other as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and confessing no other as Lord: and the Lord Himself handing down to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that He, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is the only God and Lord, who alone is God and ruler of all; &mdash; it is incumbent on us to follow, if we are their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> indeed, their testimonies to this effect. For Matthew the apostle&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Him who had given promise to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that He would make his seed as the stars of heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note013373"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;15:5</a></span> and Him who, by His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, has called us to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself, from the worship of stones, so that those who were not a people were made a people, and she beloved who was not beloved <span class="stiki" id="note013374"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;9:25</a></span> &mdash; declares that John, when preparing the way for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, said to those who were boasting of their relationship [to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>] according to the flesh, but who had their mind tinged and stuffed with all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, preaching that repentance which should call them back from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings, said, <q>O generation of vipers, who has shown you to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come? Bring forth therefore fruit meet for repentance. And think not to say within yourselves, We have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> [to our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013375"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;3:7</a></span> He preached to them, therefore, the repentance from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but he did not declare to them another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, besides Him who made the promise to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; he, the forerunner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of whom Matthew again says, and Luke likewise, <q>For this is he that was spoken of from the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough into smooth ways; and all flesh shall see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013376"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;3:3</a></span> There is therefore one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of our Lord, who also promised, through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that He would send His forerunner; and His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash; that is, His Word &mdash; He caused to be made visible to all flesh, [the Word] Himself being made incarnate, that in all things their King might become manifest. For it is necessary that those [beings] which are judged do see the judge, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him from whom they receive judgment; and it is also proper, that those which follow on to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him who bestows upon them the gift of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p>2. Then again Matthew, when speaking of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared to Joseph in sleep.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013377"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> Of what Lord he does himself interpret: <q>That it may be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, Out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have I called my son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013378"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;2:15</a></span> <q>Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>; which is, being interpreted, God with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013379"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;1:23</a></span> David likewise speaks of Him who, from the virgin, is <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>: <q>Turn not away the face of Your anointed. The Lord has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to David, and will not turn from him. Of the fruit of your body will I set upon your seat.</q>  And again: <q>In <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> is God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; His place has been made in peace, and His dwelling in Zion.</q>  Therefore there is one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and announced by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; and His Son, who was of the fruit of David's body, that is, of the virgin of [the house of] David, and <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>; whose star also Balaam thus prophesied: <q>There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a  leader shall rise in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013382"><a href="../bible/num024.htm#verse17">Numbers&nbsp;24:17</a></span> But Matthew says that the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, coming from the east, exclaimed <q>For we have seen His star in the east, and have come to worship Him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013383"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;2:2</a></span> and that, having been led by the star into the house of Jacob to <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, they showed, by these gifts which they offered, who it was that was worshipped; <em>myrrh</em>, because it was He who should die and be buried for the mortal <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; <em>gold</em>, because He was a King, <q>of whose kingdom is no end;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013384"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;1:33</a></span> and <em>frankincense</em>, because He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who also <q>was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>,</q>  and was <q>declared to those who sought Him not.</q> </p>

<p>3. And then, [speaking of His] <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, Matthew says, <q>The heavens were opened, and He saw the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, as a dove, coming upon Him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013387"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;3:16</a></span> For Christ did not at that time descend upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, neither was Christ one and Jesus another: but the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>&mdash; who is the Saviour of all, and the ruler of heaven and earth, who is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as I have already pointed out, who did also take upon Him flesh, and was anointed by the Spirit from the Father&mdash; was made <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as Esaias also says, <q>There shall come forth a rod from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise from his root; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> shall rest upon Him: the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall fill Him. He shall not judge according to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,  nor reprove after the manner of speech; but He shall dispense judgment to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> man, and reprove the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> ones of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013389"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;11:1</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And again Esaias, pointing out beforehand His unction, and the reason why he was anointed, does himself say, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is upon Me, because He has anointed Me: He has sent Me to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the lowly, to heal the broken up in heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind; to announce the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance; to comfort all that mourn.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013390"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> For inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was man from the root of Jesse, and son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, in this respect did the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> rest upon Him, and anoint Him to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the lowly. But inasmuch as He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He did not judge according to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nor reprove after the manner of speech. For <q>He needed not that any should testify to Him of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,  for He Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013392"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;2:25</a></span> For He called all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that mourn; and granting forgiveness to those who had been led into captivity by their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He loosed them from their chains, of whom Solomon says, <q>Every one shall be holden with the cords of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013393"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;5:22</a></span> Therefore did the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> descend upon Him, [the Spirit] of Him who had promised by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that He would anoint Him, so that we, receiving from the abundance of His unction, might be saved. Such, then, [is the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>] of Matthew.</p>
