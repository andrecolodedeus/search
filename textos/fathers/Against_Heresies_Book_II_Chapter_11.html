<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 11)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The heretics, from their disbelief of the truth, have fallen into an abyss of error: reasons for investigating their systems.</span>

<p>1. They do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He, who is God above all, formed by His Word, in His own territory, as He Himself pleased, the various and diversified [works of creation which exist], inasmuch as He is the former of all things, like a wise architect, and a most powerful monarch. But they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or some power separate from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him, formed this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. By this course, therefore, not yielding credit to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but wallowing in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, they have lost the bread of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, and have fallen into vacuity  and an abyss of shadow. They are like the dog of &AElig;sop, which dropped the bread, and made an attempt at seizing its shadow, thus losing the [real] food. It is easy to prove from the very words of the Lord, that He acknowledges one Father and Creator of the world, and Fashioner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who was proclaimed by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, while He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no other, and that this One is really God over all; and that He teaches that that adoption of sons pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, takes place through Himself, conferring it [as He does] on all the righteous.</p>

<p>  2. But since these men delight in attacking us, and in their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of cavillers assail us with points which really tell not at all against us, bringing forward in opposition to us a multitude of <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and [captious] questions, I have thought it well, on the other side, first of all to put to them the following inquiries concerning their own doctrines, to exhibit their improbability, and to put an end to their audacity. After this has been done, [I intend] to bring forward the discourses of the Lord, so that they may not only be rendered destitute of the means of attacking us, but that, since they will be unable reasonably to reply to those questions which are put, they may see that their plan of argument is destroyed; so that, either returning to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and humbling themselves, and ceasing from their multifarious phantasies, they may propitiate God for those <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> they have uttered against Him, and obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; or that, if they still persevere in that system of vainglory which has taken possession of their minds, they may at least find it necessary to change their kind of argument against us.</p>
