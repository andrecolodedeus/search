<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 13)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The first order of production maintained by the heretics is altogether indefensible.</span>

<p>1. I now proceed to show, as follows, that the first order of production, as conceived of by them, must be rejected. For they maintain that Nous and Aletheia were produced from Bythus and his Enn&oelig;a, which is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be a contradiction. For Nous is that which is itself chief, and highest, and, as it were, the principle and source of all understanding. Enn&oelig;a, again, which arises from him, is any sort of emotion concerning any subject. It cannot be, therefore, that Nous was produced by Bythus and Enn&oelig;a; it would be more like the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for them to maintain that Enn&oelig;a was produced as the daughter of the Propator and this Nous. For Enn&oelig;a is not the daughter of Nous, as they assert, but Nous becomes the father of Enn&oelig;a. For how can Nous have been produced by the Propator, when he holds the chief and primary place of that hidden and invisible affection which is within Him? By this affection sense is produced, and Enn&oelig;a, and Enthymesis, and other things which are simply synonyms for Nous himself. As I have said already, they are merely certain definite exercises in thought of that very power concerning some particular subject. We understand the [several] terms according to their  length and breadth of meaning, not according to any [fundamental] change [of signification]; and the [various exercises of thought] are limited by [the same sphere of] <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and are expressed together by [the same] term, the [very same] sense remaining within, and creating, and administering, and freely governing even by its own power, and as it pleases, the things which have been previously mentioned.</p>

<p>2. For the first exercise of that [power] respecting anything, is styled Enn&oelig;a; but when it continues, and gathers strength, and takes possession of the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is called Enthymesis. This Enthymesis, again, when it exercises itself a long time on the same point, and has, as it were, been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, is named Sensation. And this Sensation, when it is much developed, becomes Counsel. The increase, again, and greatly developed exercise of this Counsel becomes the Examination of thought (Judgment); and this remaining in the mind is most properly termed <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> (reason), from which the spoken <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> (word) proceeds.  But all the [exercises of thought] which have been mentioned are [fundamentally] one and the same, receiving their origin from Nous, and obtaining [different] appellation according to their increase. Just as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, which is at one time young, then in the prime of life, and then old, has received [different] appellations according to its increase and continuance, but not according to any change of substance, or on account of any [real] loss of body, so is it with those [mental exercises]. For, when one [mentally] contemplates anything, he also thinks of it; and when he thinks of it, he has also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regarding it; and when he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, he also considers it; and when he considers it, he also mentally handles it; and when he mentally handles it, he also speaks of it. But, as I have already said, it is Nous who governs all these [mental processes], while He is himself invisible, and utters speech of himself by means of those processes which have been mentioned, as it were by rays [proceeding from Him], but He himself is not sent forth by any other.</p>

<p>3. These things may properly be said to hold good in men, since they are compound by nature, and consist of a body and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But those who affirm that Enn&oelig;a was sent forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Nous from Enn&oelig;a, and then, in succession, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> from these, are, in the first place, to be blamed as having improperly used these productions; and, in the next place, as describing the affections, and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and mental tendencies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, while they [thus prove themselves]  <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By their manner of speaking, they ascribe those things which apply to men to the Father of all, whom they also declare to be unknown to all; and they deny that He himself made the world, to guard against attributing want of power  to Him; while, at the same time, they endow Him with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affections and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and been taught by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that God is not as men are; and that His thoughts are not like the thoughts of men. <span class="stiki" id="note013046"><a href="../bible/isa055.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;55:8</a></span> For the Father of all is at a vast distance from those affections and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which operate among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. He is a simple, uncompounded Being, without diverse members,  and altogether like, and equal to himself, since He is wholly understanding, and wholly spirit, and wholly thought, and wholly intelligence, and wholly reason, and wholly hearing, and wholly seeing, and wholly light, and the whole source of all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>&mdash; even as the religious and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> are wont to speak concerning God.</p>

<p>4. He is, however, above [all] these properties, and therefore indescribable. For He may well and properly be called an Understanding which comprehends all things, but He is not [on that account] like the understanding of men; and He may most properly be termed Light, but He is nothing like that light with which we are acquainted. And so, in all other particulars, the Father of all is in no degree similar to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness. He is spoken of in these terms according to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> [we bear Him]; but in point of greatness, our thoughts regarding Him transcend these expressions. If then, even in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, understanding itself does not arise from emission, nor is that intelligence which produces other things separated from the living man, while its motions and affections come into manifestation, much more will the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is all understanding, never by any means be separated from Himself; nor can anything  [in His case] be produced as if by a different Being.</p>

<p>5. For if He produced intelligence, then He who did thus produce intelligence must be understood, in accordance with their views, as a compound and corporeal Being; so that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who sent forth [the intelligence referred to], is separate from it, and the intelligence which was sent forth separate [from Him]. But if they affirm that intelligence was sent forth from intelligence, they then cut asunder the intelligence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and divide it into parts. And whither has it gone? Whence was it sent forth? For whatever is sent forth from any place, passes of necessity into some other. But what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> was there more ancient than the intelligence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, into which they maintain it was sent forth? And what a vast region that must have been which was capable of receiving and containing the intelligence of God! If, however, they affirm [that this emission took place] just as a ray proceeds from the sun, then, as the subjacent air which receives the ray must have had an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> prior to it, so [by such reasoning] they will indicate that there was something in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, into which the intelligence of God was sent forth, capable of containing it, and more ancient than itself. Following upon this, we must hold that, as we see the sun, which is less than all things, sending forth rays from himself to a great distance, so likewise we say that the Propator sent forth a ray beyond, and to a great distance from, Himself. But what can be conceived of beyond, or at a distance from, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, into which He sent forth this ray?</p>

<p>6. If, again, they affirm that that [intelligence] was not sent forth beyond the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but within the Father Himself, then, in the first place, it becomes superfluous to say that it was sent forth at all. For how could it have been sent forth if it continued within the Father? For an emission is the manifestation of that which is emitted, beyond him who emits it. In the next place, this [intelligence] being sent forth, both that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> who springs from Him will still be within the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as will also be the future emissions proceeding from <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. These, then, cannot in such a case be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since they are within Him; nor, being all equally surrounded by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, can any one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him less [than another] according to the descending order of their emission. And all of them must also in an equal measure continue impassible, since they exist in the bosom of their Father, and none of them can ever sink into a state of degeneracy or degradation. For with the Father there is no degeneracy, unless perchance as in a great circle a smaller is contained, and within this one again a smaller; or unless they affirm of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that, after the manner of a sphere or a square, He contains within Himself on all sides the likeness of a sphere, or the production of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> in the form of a square, each one of these being surrounded by that one who is above him in greatness, and surrounding in turn that one who is after him in smallness; and that on this account, the smallest and the last of all, having its place in the centre, and thus being far separated from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, was really <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Propator. But if they maintain any such hypothesis, they must shut up their Bythus within  a definite form and space, while He both surrounds others, and is surrounded by them; for they must of necessity acknowledge that there is something outside of Him which surrounds Him. And none the less will the talk concerning those that contain, and those that are contained, flow on into infinitude; and all [the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>] will most clearly appear to be bodies enclosed [by one another].</p>

<p>7. Further, they must also confess either that He is mere vacuity, or that the entire <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is within Him; and in that case all will in like degree partake of the Father. Just as, if one forms circles in water, or round or square figures, all these will equally partake of water; just as those, again, which are framed in the air, must necessarily partake of air, and those which [are formed] in light, of light; so must those also who are within Him all equally partake of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> having no place among them. Where, then, is this partaking of the Father who fills [all things]? If, indeed, He has filled [all things], there will be no <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> among them. On this ground, then, their work of [supposed] degeneracy is brought to nothing, and the production of matter with the formation of the rest of the world; which things they maintain to have derived their substance from passion and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. If, on the other hand, they acknowledge that He is vacuity, then they fall into the greatest <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; they deny His spiritual nature. For how can He be a spiritual being, who cannot fill even those things which are within Him?</p>

<p>8. Now, these remarks which have been made concerning the emission of intelligence are in like manner applicable in opposition to those who belong to the school of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, as well as in opposition to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, from whom these also (the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>) have adopted the ideas about emissions, and were refuted in the first book. But I have now plainly shown that the first production of Nous, that is, of the intelligence they speak of, is an untenable and impossible opinion. And let us see how the matter stands with respect to the rest [of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>]. For they maintain that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and Zoe were sent forth by him (i.e., Nous) as fashioners of this Pleroma; while they conceive of an emission of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, that is, the Word after the analogy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feelings, and rashly form conjectures respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if they had discovered something wonderful in their assertion that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> was I produced by Nous. All indeed have a clear perception that this may be <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> affirmed with respect to men.  But in Him who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all, since He is all Nous, and all <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, as I have said before, and has in Himself nothing more ancient or late than another, and nothing at variance with another, but continues altogether equal, and similar, and homogeneous, there is no longer ground for conceiving of such production in the order which has been mentioned. Just as he does not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> who declares that God is all vision, and all hearing (for in what manner He sees, in that also He hears; and in what manner He hears, in that also He sees), so also he who affirms that He is all intelligence, and all word, and that, in whatever respect He is intelligence, in that also He is word, and that this Nous is His <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, will still indeed have only an inadequate conception of the Father of all, but will entertain far more becoming [thoughts regarding Him] than do those who transfer the generation of the word to which men gave utterance to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, assigning a beginning and course of production [to Him], even as they do to their own word. And in what respect will the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>&mdash; yea, rather God Himself, since He is the Word&mdash; differ from the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, if He follows the same order and process of generation?</p>

<p>9. They have fallen into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, too, respecting Zoe, by maintaining that she was produced in the sixth place, when it behooved her to take precedence of all [the rest], since God is life, and incorruption, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And these and such like attributes have not been produced according to a gradual scale of descent, but they are names of those perfections which always exist in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far as it is possible and proper for men to hear and to speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For with the name of God the following words will harmonize: intelligence, word, life, incorruption, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wisdom, goodness, and such like. And neither can any one maintain that intelligence is more ancient than life, for intelligence itself is life; nor that life is later than intelligence, so that He who is the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of all, that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should at one time have been destitute of life. But if they affirm that life was indeed [previously] in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but was produced in the sixth place in order that the Word might live, surely it ought long before, [according to such reasoning,] to have been sent forth, in the fourth place, that Nous might have life; and still further, even before Him, [it should have been] with Bythus, that their Bythus might live. For to reckon Sige, indeed, along with their Propator, and to assign her to Him as His consort, while they do not join Zoe to the number&mdash;is not this to surpass all other <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>?</p>

<p>10. Again, as to the second production which proceeds from these [<a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> who have been mentioned]&mdash;that, namely, of Homo and Ecclesia&mdash;their very fathers, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> styled <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, strive among themselves, each one seeking to make good his own opinions, and thus convicting themselves of being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thieves.  They maintain that it is more suitable to [the theory of] production&mdash; as being, in fact, truth-like&mdash; that the Word was produced by man, and not man by the Word; and that man <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> prior to the Word, and that this is really He who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all. And thus it is, as I have previously remarked, that heaping together with a kind of plausibility all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feelings, and mental exercises, and formation of intentions, and utterances of words, they have lied with no plausibility at all against God. For while they ascribe the things which happen to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and whatsoever they recognise themselves as experiencing, to the divine reason, they seem to those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God to make statements suitable enough. And by these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, drawing away their intelligence, while they describe the origin and production of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> in the fifth place, they assert that thus they teach wonderful <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, unspeakable and sublime, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to no one but themselves. It was, [they affirm,] concerning these that the Lord said, <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013050"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> that is, that they should inquire how Nous and Aletheia proceeded from Bythus and Sage; whether <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and Zoe again derive their origin from these and then, whether Anthropos and Ecclesia proceed from <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and Zoe.</p>
