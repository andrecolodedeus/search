<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 17)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Inquiry into the production of the &AElig;ons: whatever its supposed nature, it is in every respect inconsistent; and on the hypothesis of the heretics, even Nous and the Father Himself would be stained with ignorance.</span>

<p>1. That system, then, which has respect to their Pleroma, and especially that part of it which refers to the primary Ogdoad being thus burdened with so great contradictions and perplexities, let me now go on to examine the remainder of their scheme. [In doing so] on account of their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, I shall be making inquiry respecting things which have no real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; yet it is necessary to do this, since the treatment of this subject has been entrusted to me, and since I desire all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>  to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as well as because you yourself have asked to receive from me full and complete means for overturning [the views of] these men.</p>

<p>2. I ask, then, in what manner were the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> produced? Was it so as to be united with Him who produced them, even as the solar rays are with the sun; or was it actually  and separately, so that each of them possessed an independent <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and his own special form, just as has a man from another man, and one herd of cattle from another? Or was it after the manner of germination, as branches from a tree? And were they of the same substance with those who produced them, or did they derive their substance from some other [kind of] substance? Also, were they produced at the same time, so as to be contemporaries; or after a certain order, so that some of them were older, and others younger? And, again, are they uncompounded and uniform, and altogether equal and similar among themselves, as spirit and light are produced; or are they compounded and different, unlike [to each other] in their members?</p>

<p>3. If each of them was produced, after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, actually and according to its own generation, then either those thus generated by the Father will be of the same substance with Him, and similar to their Author; or if  they appear dissimilar, then it must of necessity be acknowledged that they are [formed] of some different substance. Now, if the beings generated by the Father be similar to their Author, then those who have been produced must remain for ever impassible, even as is He who produced them; but if, on the other hand, they are of a different substance, which is capable of passion, then whence came this dissimilar substance to find a place within the incorruptible Pleroma? Further, too, according to this principle, each one of them must be understood as being completely separated from every other, even as men are not mixed with nor united the one to the other, but each having a distinct shape of his own, and a definite sphere of action, while each one of them, too, is formed of a particular size, &mdash; qualities characteristic of a body, and not of a spirit. Let them therefore no longer speak of the Pleroma as being <em>spiritual</em>, or of themselves as <q>spiritual,</q> if indeed their <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> sit feasting with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, just as if they were men, and He Himself is of such a configuration as those reveal Him to be who were produced by Him.</p>

<p>4. If, again, the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> were derived from <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> from Nous, and Nous from Bythus, just as lights are kindled from a light&mdash; as, for example, torches are from a torch&mdash; then they may no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> differ in generation and size from one another; but since they are of the same substance with the Author of their production, they must either all remain for ever impassible, or their Father Himself must participate in passion. For the torch which has been kindled subsequently cannot be possessed of a different kind of light from that which preceded it. Wherefore also their lights, when blended in one, return to the original identity, since that one light is then formed which has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> even from the beginning. But we cannot speak, with respect to light itself, of some part being more recent in its origin, and another being more ancient (for the whole is but one light); nor can we so speak even in regard to those torches which have received the light (for these are all contemporary as respects their material substance, for the substance of torches is one and the same), but simply as to [the time of] its being kindled, since one was lighted a little while ago, and another has just now been kindled.</p>

<p>5. The defect, therefore, of that passion which has regard to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, will either attach alike to their whole Pleroma, since [all its members] are of the same substance; and the Propator will share in this defect of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>&mdash; that is, will be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Himself; or, on the other hand, all those lights which are within the Pleroma will alike remain for ever impassible. Whence, then, comes the passion of the youngest <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, if the light of the Father is that from which all other lights have been formed, and which is by nature impassible? And how can one <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> be spoken of as either younger or older among themselves, since there is but one light in the entire Pleroma? And if any one calls them stars, they will all nevertheless appear to participate in the same nature. For if <q>one star differs from another star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013075"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:41</a></span> but not in qualities, nor substance, nor in the fact of being passible or impassible; so all these, since they are alike derived from the light of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, must either be naturally impassible and immutable, or they must all, in common with the light of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, be passible, and are capable of the varying phases of corruption.</p>

<p>6. The same conclusion will follow, although they affirm that the production of <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> sprang from <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, as branches from a tree, since <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> has his generation from their Father. For all [the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>] are formed of the same substance with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, differing from one another only in size, and not in nature, and filling up the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even as the fingers complete  the hand. If therefore He exists in passion and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, so must also those <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> who have been generated by Him. But if it is impious to ascribe <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and passion to the Father of all, how can they describe an <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> produced by Him as being passible; and while they ascribe the same impiety to the very wisdom (Sophia) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how can they still call themselves religious men?</p>

<p>7. If, again, they declare that their <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> were sent forth just as rays are from the sun, then, since all are of the same substance and sprung from the same source, all must either be capable of passion along with Him who produced them, or all will remain impassible for ever. For they can no longer maintain that, of beings so produced, some are impassible and others passible. If, then, they declare all impassible, they do themselves destroy their own argument. For how could the youngest <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> have suffered passion if all were impassible? If, on the other hand, they declare that all partook of this passion, as indeed some of them venture to maintain, then, inasmuch as it originated with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>,  but flowed onwards to Sophia, they will thus be convicted of tracing back the passion to <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, who is the  Nous of this Propator, and so acknowledging the Nous of the Propator and the Father Himself to have experienced passion. For the Father of all is not to be regarded as a kind of compound Being, who can be separated from his Nous (mind), as I have already shown; but Nous is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father Nous. It necessarily follows, therefore, both that he who springs from Him as <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, or rather that Nous himself, since he is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, must be perfect and impassible, and that those productions which proceed from him, seeing that they are of the same substance with himself, should be perfect and impassible, and should ever remain similar to him who produced them.</p>

<p>8. It cannot therefore longer be held, as these men teach, that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, as occupying the third place in generation, was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Father. Such a thing might indeed perhaps be deemed probable in the case of the generation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, inasmuch as these frequently <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; but it is altogether impossible in the case of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of the Father. For if, existing in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him in whom he exists&mdash; that is, is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of himself&mdash; then those productions which issue from him being his powers (faculties), and always present with him, will not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of him who emitted them, any more than rays [may be supposed to be] of the sun. It is impossible, therefore, that the Sophia (wisdom) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, she who is within the Pleroma, inasmuch as she has been produced in such a manner, should have fallen under the influence of passion, and conceived such <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But it is possible that that Sophia (wisdom) who pertains to [the scheme] of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, inasmuch as she is a production of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, should fall into every kind of passion, and exhibit the profoundest <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For when they themselves bear testimony concerning their mother, to the effect that she was the offspring of an erring <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, we need no longer search for a reason why the sons of such a mother should be ever swimming in the depths of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<p>9. I am not aware that, besides these productions [which have been mentioned], they are able to speak of any other; indeed, they have not been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me (although I have had very frequent discussions with them concerning forms of this kind) as ever setting forth any other peculiar kind of being as produced [in the manner under consideration]. This only they maintain, that each one of these <em>was so produced</em> as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> merely that one who produced him, while he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the one who immediately preceded. But they do not in this matter go forward [in their account] with any kind of demonstration as to the manner in which these were produced, or how such a thing could take place among spiritual beings. For, in whatsoever way they may choose to go forward, they will feel themselves bound (while, as regards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they depart  entirely from right reason) to proceed so far as to maintain that their Word, who springs from the Nous of the Propator, &mdash; to maintain, I say, that he was produced in a state of degeneracy. For [they hold] that perfect Nous, previously begotten by the perfect Bythus, was not capable of rendering that production which issued from him perfect, but [could only bring it forth] utterly blind to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and greatness of the Father. They also maintain that the Saviour exhibited an emblem of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in the case of that man who was blind from his birth, <span class="stiki" id="note013079"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;9:1</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> since the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> was in this manner produced by Monogenes blind, that is, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, thus <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribing <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and blindness to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who, according to their own theory, holds the second [place of] production from the Propator. Admirable sophists, and explorers of the sublimities of the unknown Father, and rehearsers of those super-celestial <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> <q>which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> desire to look into!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013080"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:12</a></span> &mdash; that they may learn that from the Nous of that Father who is above all, the Word was produced <em>blind</em>, that is, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Father who produced him!</p>

<p>  10. But, you miserable sophists, how could the Nous of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or rather the very Father Himself, since He is Nous and perfect in all things, have produced his own <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> as an imperfect and blind <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, when He was able also to produce along with him the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father? As you affirm that Christ was generated  after the rest, and yet declare that he was produced perfect, much more then should <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, who is anterior to him in age, be produced by the same Nous, unquestionably perfect, and not blind; nor could he, again, have produced <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> still blinder than himself, until at last your Sophia, always utterly blinded, gave birth to so vast a body of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. And your Father is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all this mischief; for you declare the magnitude and power of your Father to be the causes of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, assimilating Him to Bythus, and assigning this as a name to Him who is the unnameable Father. But if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and you declare all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to have derived their strength from it, while you maintain that the greatness and power of the Father is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, you do thus set Him forth as the author of [all] <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For you state as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> this fact, that [no one] could contemplate His greatness. But if it was really impossible for the Father to make Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the beginning to those [beings] that were formed by Him, He must in that case be held free from blame, inasmuch as He <em>could not</em> remove the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of those who came after Him. But if, at a subsequent period, when He so willed it, He <em>could</em> take away that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which had increased with the successive productions as they followed each other, and thus become deeply seated in the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, much more, had He so willed it might He formerly have prevented that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which as yet was not, from coming into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</p>

<p>11. Since therefore, as soon as He so pleased, He did become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not only to the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, but also to these men who lived in these latter times; but, as He did not so please to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the beginning, He remained unknown&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is, according to you, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father. For if He foreknew that these things would in future happen in such a manner, why then did He not guard against the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of these beings before it had obtained a place among them, rather than afterwards, as if under the influence of repentance, deal with it through the production of Christ? For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which through Christ He conveyed to all, He might long before have imparted through <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, who was also the first-begotten of Monogenes. Or if, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them beforehand, He willed that these things should happen [as they have done], then the works of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> must endure for ever, and never pass away. For the things which have been made in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of your Propator must continue along with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who willed them; or if they pass away, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him also who decreed that they should have a being will pass away along with them. And why did the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> find rest and attain perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through learning [at last] that the Father is altogether  incomprehensible? They might surely have possessed this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> before they became involved in passion; for the greatness of the Father did not suffer diminution from the beginning, so that these might  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was altogether incomprehensible. For if, on account of His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> greatness, He remained unknown, He ought also on account of His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to have preserved those impassible who were produced by Him, since nothing hindered, and expediency rather required, that they should have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the beginning that the Father was altogether incomprehensible.</p>
