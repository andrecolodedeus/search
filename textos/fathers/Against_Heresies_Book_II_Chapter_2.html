<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 2)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The world was not formed by angels, or by any other being, contrary to the will of the most high God, but was made by the Father through the Word. </span>

<p>1. Those, moreover, who say that the world was formed by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or by any other maker of it, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who is the Supreme Father, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> first of all in this very point, that they maintain that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> formed such and so mighty a creation, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Most High God. This would imply that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were more powerful than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or if not so, that He was either careless, or inferior, or paid no regard to those things which took place among His own possessions, whether they turned out ill or well, so that He might drive away and prevent the one, while He praised and rejoiced over the other. But if one would not ascribe such conduct even to a man of any ability, how much less to God</p>

<p>2. Next let them tell us whether these things have been formed within the limits which are contained by Him, and in His proper territory, or in regions belonging to others, and lying beyond Him? But if they say [that these things were done] beyond Him, then all the absurdities already mentioned will face them, and the Supreme God will be enclosed by that which is beyond Him, in which also it will be necessary that He should find His end. If, on the other hand, [these things were done] within His own proper territory, it will be very idle to say that the world was thus formed within His proper territory against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are themselves under His power, or by any other being, as if either He Himself did not behold all things which take place among His own possessions, or  was not aware of the things to be done by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>3. If, however, [the things referred to were done] not against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but with His concurrence and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as some [of these men] think, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or the Former of the world [whoever that may have been], will no longer be the causes of that formation, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if <em>He</em> is the Former of the world, He too made the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or at least was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their creation; and He will be regarded as having made the world who prepared the causes of its formation. Although they maintain that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were made by a long succession downwards, or that the Former of the world [sprang] from the Supreme Father, as <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> asserts; nevertheless that which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of those things which have been made will still be traced to Him who was the Author of such a succession. [The case stands] just as regards success in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which is ascribed to the king who prepared those things which are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of victory; and, in like manner, the creation of any state, or of any work, is referred to him who prepared materials for the accomplishment of those results which were afterwards brought about. Wherefore, we do not say that it was the axe which cut the wood, or the saw which divided it; but one would very properly say that the <em>man</em> cut and divided it who formed the axe and the saw for this purpose, and [who also formed] at a much earlier date all the tools by which the axe and the saw themselves were formed. With <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, therefore, according to an analogous process of reasoning, the Father of all will be declared the Former of this world, and not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor any other [so-called] former of the world, other than He who was its Author, and had formerly  been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the preparation for a creation of this kind.</p>

<p>4. This manner of speech may perhaps be plausible or persuasive to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who liken Him to needy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, and to those who cannot immediately and without assistance form anything, but require many instrumentalities to produce what they intend. But it will not be regarded as at all probable by those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God stands in need of nothing, and that He created and made all things by His Word, while He neither required <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to assist Him in the production of those things which are made, nor of any power greatly inferior to Himself, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor of any defect or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, in order that he who should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him might become man.  But He Himself in Himself, after a fashion which we can neither describe nor conceive, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> all things, formed them as He pleased, bestowing harmony on all things, and assigning them their own place, and the beginning of their creation. In this way He conferred on spiritual things a spiritual and invisible nature, on super-celestial things a celestial, on <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> an angelical, on animals an animal, on beings that swim a nature suited to the water, and on those that live on the land one fitted for the land&mdash; on all, in short, a nature suitable to the character of the life assigned them&mdash; while He formed all things that were made by His Word that never wearies.</p>

<p>5. For this is a peculiarity of the pre-eminence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not to stand in need of other instruments for the creation of those things which are summoned into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. His own Word is both suitable and sufficient for the formation of all things, even as John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord,  declares regarding Him: <q>All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012994"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Now, among the <q>all things</q> our world must be embraced. It too, therefore, was made by His Word, as Scripture tells us in the book of Genesis that He made all things connected with our world by His Word. David also expresses the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> [when he says] <q>For He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.</q>  Whom, therefore, shall we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> as to the creation of the world&mdash; these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who have been mentioned that prate so foolishly and inconsistently on the subject, or the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who was both a faithful servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? He at first narrated the formation of the world in these words: <q>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012996"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and all other things in succession; but neither gods nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> [had any share in the work].</p>

<p>Now, that this God is the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle also has declared, [saying,] <q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who is above all, and through all things, and in us all.</q>  I have indeed <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> already that there is only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but I shall further demonstrate this from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves, and from the discourses of the Lord. For what sort of conduct would it be, were we to forsake the utterances of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, of the Lord, and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that we might give heed to these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who speak not a word of sense?</p>
