<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 20)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Futility of the arguments adduced to demonstrate the sufferings of the twelfth &AElig;on, from the parables, the treachery of Judas, and the passion of our Saviour.</span>

<p>1. That they improperly and illogically apply both the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and the actions of the Lord to their falsely-devised system, I prove as follows: They endeavour, for instance, to demonstrate that passion which, they say, happened in the case of the twelfth <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, from this fact, that the passion of the Saviour was brought about by the twelfth apostle, and happened in the twelfth month. For they hold that He preached [only] for one year after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. They maintain also that the same thing was clearly set forth in the case of her who suffered from the issue of blood. For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> suffered during twelve years, and  through touching the hem of the Saviour's garment she was made whole by that power which went forth from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and which, they affirm, had a previous <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For that Power who suffered was stretching herself outwards and flowing into immensity, so that she was in danger of being dissolved into the general substance [of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>]; but then, touching the primary Tetrad, which is typified by the hem of the garment, she was arrested, and ceased from her passion.</p>

<p>2. Then, again, as to their assertion that the passion of the twelfth <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> through the conduct of Judas, how is it possible that Judas can be compared [with this <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>] as being an emblem of her&mdash; he who was expelled from the number of the twelve,  and never restored to his place? For that <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, whose type they declare Judas to be, after being separated from her Enthymesis, was restored or recalled [to her former position]; but Judas was deprived [of his office], and cast out, while Matthias was ordained in his place, according to what is written, <q>And his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> let another take.</q>  They ought therefore to maintain that the twelfth <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> was cast out of the Pleroma, and that another was produced, or sent forth to fill her place; if, that is to say, she is pointed at in Judas. Moreover, they tell us that it was the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> herself who suffered, but Judas was the betrayer, [and not the sufferer.] Even they themselves acknowledge that it was the suffering Christ, and not Judas, who came to [the endurance of] passion. How, then, could Judas, the betrayer of Him who had to suffer for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, be the type and image of that <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> who suffered?</p>

<p>3. But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was neither similar to the passion of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, nor did it take place in similar circumstances. For the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> underwent a passion of dissolution and destruction, so that she who suffered was in danger also of being destroyed. But the Lord, our Christ, underwent a valid, and not a merely  accidental passion; not only was He Himself not in danger of being destroyed, but He also established fallen man  by His own strength, and recalled him to incorruption. The <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, again, underwent passion while she was seeking after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and was not able to find Him; but the Lord suffered that He might bring those who have wandered from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, back to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and to His fellowship. The search into the greatness of the Father became to her a passion leading to destruction; but the Lord, having suffered, and bestowing the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, conferred on us <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Her passion, as they declare, gave origin to a female offspring, weak, infirm, unformed, and ineffective; but His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> gave rise to strength and power. For the Lord, through means of suffering, <q>ascending into the lofty place, led captivity captive, gave gifts to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q>  and conferred on those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him the power <q>to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy,</q>  that is, of the leader of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>. Our Lord also by His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> destroyed death, and dispersed <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and put an end to corruption, and destroyed <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, while He manifested life and revealed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and bestowed the gift of incorruption. But their <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, when she had suffered, established  <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and brought forth a substance without shape, out of which all material works have been produced&mdash; death, corruption, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and such like.</p>

<p>4. Judas, then, the twelfth in order of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, was not a type of the suffering <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, nor, again, was the passion of the Lord; for these two things have been shown to be in every respect mutually dissimilar and inharmonious. This is the case not only as respects the points which I have already mentioned, but with regard to the very number. For that Judas the traitor is the twelfth in order, is agreed upon by all, there being twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> mentioned by name in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. But this <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> is not the <em>twelfth</em>, but the <em>thirtieth</em>; for, according to the views under consideration, there were not twelve <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> only produced by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor was she sent forth the twelfth in order: they reckon her, [on the contrary,] as having been produced in the thirtieth place. How, then, can Judas, the twelfth in order, be the type and image of that <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> who occupies the thirtieth place?</p>

<p>5. But if they say that Judas in perishing was the image of her Enthymesis, neither in this way will the image bear any analogy to that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which [by hypothesis] corresponds to it. For the Enthymesis having been separated from the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, and itself afterwards receiving a shape from Christ,  then being made a partaker of intelligence by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and having formed all things which are outside of the Pleroma, after the image of those which are within the Pleroma, is said at last to have been received by them into the Pleroma, and, according to [the principle of] conjunction, to have been united to that Saviour who was formed out of all. But Judas having been once for all cast away, never returns  into the number of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; otherwise a different person would not have been chosen to fill his place. Besides, the Lord also declared regarding him, <q>Woe to the man by whom the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013106"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;26:24</a></span> and, <q>It were better for him if he had never been born;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013107"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;14:21</a></span> and he was called the <q>son of perdition</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013108"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;17:12</a></span> by Him. If, however, they say that Judas was a type of the Enthymesis, not as separated from the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, but of the passion entwined with her, neither in this way can the number twelve be regarded as a [fitting] type of the number three. For in the one case Judas was cast away, and Matthias was ordained instead of him; but in the other case the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> is said to have been in danger of dissolution and destruction, and [there are also] her Enthymesis and passion: for they markedly distinguish Enthymesis from the passion; and they represent the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> as being restored, and Enthymesis as acquiring form, but the passion, when separated from these, as becoming matter. Since, therefore, there are thus these three, the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, her Enthymesis, and her passion, Judas and Matthias, being only two, cannot be the types of them.</p>
