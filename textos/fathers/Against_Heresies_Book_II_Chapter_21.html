<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 21)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The twelve apostles were not a type of the &AElig;ons.</span>

<p>1. If, again, they maintain that the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were a type only of that group of twelve <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> which Anthropos in conjunction with Ecclesia produced, then let them produce ten other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as a type of those ten remaining <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, who, as they declare, were produced by <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and Zoe. For it is unreasonable to suppose that the junior, and for that reason inferior <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, were set forth by the Saviour through the election of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, while their seniors, and on this account their superiors, were not thus foreshown; since the Saviour (if, that is to say, He chose the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with this view, that by means of them He might show forth the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> who are in the Pleroma) might have chosen other ten <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also, and likewise other eight before these, that thus He might set forth the original and primary Ogdoad. He could not,  in regard to the second [Duo] Decad, show forth [any emblem of it] through the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> being [already] constituted a type. For [He made choice of no such other number of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; but] after the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, our Lord is found to have sent seventy others before Him. <span class="stiki" id="note013110"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;10:1</a></span> Now <em>seventy</em> cannot possibly be the type either of an Ogdoad, a Decad, or a Triacontad. What is the reason, then, that the inferior <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are, as I have said, represented by means of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; but the superior, from whom, too, the former derived their being, are not prefigured at all? But if  the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were chosen with this object, that the number of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> might be indicated by means of them, then the seventy also ought to have been chosen to be the type of seventy <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>; and in that case, they must affirm that the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are no longer thirty, but eighty-two in number. For He who made choice of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that they might be a type of those <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> existing in the Pleroma, would never have constituted them types of some and not of others; but by means of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> He would have tried to preserve an image and to exhibit a type of those <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> that exist in the Pleroma.</p>

<p>2. Moreover we must not keep silence respecting <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but demand from them after the type of what <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> that apostle has been handed down to us, unless perchance [they affirm that he is a representative] of the Saviour compounded of them [all], who derived his being from the collected gifts of the whole, and whom they term <em>All Things</em>, as having been formed out of them all. Respecting this being the poet Hesiod has strikingly expressed himself, styling him Pandora &mdash; that is, <q>The gift of all</q>&mdash; for this reason, that the best gift in the possession of all was centred in him. In describing these gifts the following account is given: Hermes (so  he is called in the Greek language), <span class="greek">&#x0391;&#x1F31;&#x03BC;&#x03C5;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C2;</span>  <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5; &#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C2; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x1F77;&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x1F26;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x03B1;&#x1F50;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1F7A;&#x03C2; &#x039A;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;</span> (or to express this in our own language), <q>implanted words of fraud and deceit in their minds, and thievish habits,</q> for the purpose of leading foolish men astray, that such should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> their falsehoods. For their Mother&mdash; that is, Leto &mdash; secretly stirred them up (whence also she is called Leto,  according to the meaning of the Greek word, because she <em>secretly</em> stirred up men), without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, to give forth profound and unspeakable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> to itching ears. <span class="stiki" id="note013117"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:3</a></span> And not only did their Mother bring it about that this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> should be declared by Hesiod; but very skilfully also by means of the lyric poet Pindar, when he describes to the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>  the  case of Pelops, whose flesh was cut in pieces by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and then collected and brought together, and compacted anew by all the gods,  did she in this way indicate Pandora and these men having their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> seared  by her, declaring, as they maintain, the very same things, are [<a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>] of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and spirit as the others.</p>
