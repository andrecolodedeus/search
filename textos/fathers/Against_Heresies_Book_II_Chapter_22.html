<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 22)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The thirty &AElig;ons are not typified by the fact that Christ was baptized in His thirtieth year: He did not suffer in the twelfth month after His baptism, but was more than fifty years old when He died.</span>

<p>1. I have shown that the number <em>thirty</em> fails them in every respect; too few <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, as they represent them, being at one time found within the Pleroma, and then again too many [to correspond with that number]. There are not, therefore, thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, nor did the Saviour come to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when He was thirty years old, for this reason, that He might show forth the thirty silent  <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> of their system, otherwise they must first of all separate and eject [the Saviour] Himself from the Pleroma of all. Moreover, they affirm that He suffered in the twelfth month, so that He continued to preach for one year after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and they endeavour to establish this point out of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> (for it is written, <q>To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of retribution</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013122"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;61:2</a></span>), being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blind, inasmuch as they affirm they have found out the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Bythus, yet not understanding that which is called by Isaiah the acceptable year of the Lord, nor the day of retribution. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> neither speaks concerning a day which includes the space of twelve hours, nor of a year the length of which is twelve months. For even they themselves acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have very often expressed themselves in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and allegories, and [are] not [to be understood] according to the mere sound of the words.</p>

<p>2. That, then, was called the day of retribution on which the Lord will render to every one according to his works&mdash; that is, the judgment. The acceptable year of the Lord, again, is this present time, in which those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him are called by Him, and become acceptable to God&mdash; that is, the whole time from His advent onwards to the consummation [of all things], during which He acquires to Himself as fruits [of the scheme of mercy] those who are saved. For, according to the phraseology of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, the day of retribution follows the [acceptable] year; and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> will be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> guilty of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> if the Lord preached only for a year, and if he speaks of it. For where is the day of retribution? For the year has passed, and the day of retribution has not yet come; but He still <q>makes His sun to rise upon the good and upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and sends rain upon the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013123"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> And the righteous suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, are afflicted, and are slain, while sinners are possessed of abundance, and <q>drink with the sound of the harp and psaltery, but do not regard the works of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013124"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;5:12</a></span> But, according to the language [used by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>], they ought to be combined, and the day of retribution to follow the [acceptable] year. For the words are, <q>to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of retribution.</q> This present time, therefore, in which men are called and saved by the Lord, is properly understood to be denoted by <q>the acceptable year of the Lord;</q> and there follows on this <q>the day of retribution,</q> that is, the judgment. And the time thus referred to is not called <q>a year</q> only, but is also named <q>a day</q> both by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, of whom the apostle, calling to mind the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, says in the Epistle addressed to the Romans, <q>As it is written, for your sake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013125"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse36">Romans&nbsp;8:36</a></span> But here the expression <q>all the day long</q> is put for all this time during which we suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and are killed as sheep. As then this <em>day</em> does not signify one which consists of twelve hours, but the whole time during which <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in Christ suffer and are <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for His sake, so also the <em>year</em> there mentioned does not denote one which consists of twelve months, but the whole time of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> during which men hear and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and those become acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who unite themselves to Him.</p>

<p>3. But it is greatly to be wondered at, how it has come to pass that, while affirming that they have found out the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they have not examined the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to ascertain how often after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the Lord went up, at the time of the passover, to Jerusalem, in accordance with what was the practice of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from every land, and every year, that they should assemble at this period in Jerusalem, and there celebrate the feast of the passover. First of all, after He had made the water wine at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, He went up to the festival day of the passover, on which occasion it is written, <q>For many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, when they saw the signs which He did,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013126"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;2:23</a></span>  as John the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord records. Then, again, withdrawing Himself [from Jud&aelig;a], He is found in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>; on which occasion, too, He conversed with the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and while at a distance, cured the son of the centurion by a word, saying, <q>Go your way, your son lives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013127"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse50">John&nbsp;4:50</a></span> Afterwards He went up, the second time, to observe the festival day of the passover  in Jerusalem; on which occasion He cured the paralytic man, who had lain beside the pool thirty-eight years, bidding him rise, take up his couch, and depart. Again, withdrawing from thence to the other side of the sea of Tiberias, <span class="stiki" id="note013129"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;6:1</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> He there seeing a great crowd had followed Him, fed all that multitude with five loaves of bread, and twelve baskets of fragments remained over and above. Then, when He had raised Lazarus from the dead, and plots were formed against Him by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, He withdrew to a city called Ephraim; and from that place, as it is written <q>He came to Bethany six days before the passover,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013130"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse54">John&nbsp;11:54</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;12:1</a></span> and going up from Bethany to Jerusalem, He there ate the passover, and suffered on the day following. Now, that these three occasions of the passover are not included within one year, every person whatever must acknowledge. And that the special month in which the passover was celebrated, and in which also the Lord suffered, was not the twelfth, but the first, those men who boast that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not this, may learn it from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Their explanation, therefore, both of the year and of the twelfth month has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> false, and they ought to reject either their explanation or the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; otherwise [this unanswerable question forces itself upon them], How is it possible that the Lord preached for one year only?</p>

<p>4. Being thirty years old when He came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and then possessing the full age of a Master,  He came to Jerusalem, so that He might be properly acknowledged  by all as a Master. For He did not seem one thing while He was another, as those affirm who describe Him as being man only in appearance; but what He was, that He also appeared to be. Being a Master, therefore, He also possessed the age of a Master, not despising or evading any condition of humanity, nor setting aside in Himself that law which He had  appointed for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, but sanctifying every age, by that period corresponding to it which belonged to Himself. For He came to save all through means of Himself&mdash; all, I say, who through Him are born again to God &mdash; infants,  and children, and boys, and youths, and old men. He therefore passed through every age, becoming an infant for infants, thus sanctifying infants; a child for children, thus sanctifying those who are of this age, being at the same time made to them an example of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, righteousness, and submission; a youth for youths, becoming an example to youths, and thus sanctifying them for the Lord. So likewise He was an old man for old men, that He might be a perfect Master for all, not merely as respects the setting forth of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but also as regards age, sanctifying at the same time the aged also, and becoming an example to them likewise. Then, at last, He came on to death itself, that He might be <q>the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the dead, that in all things He might have the pre-eminence,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013136"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> the Prince of life, <span class="stiki" id="note013137"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;3:15</a></span> existing before all, and going before all. </p>

<p>5. They, however, that they may establish their false opinion regarding that which is written, <q>to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,</q> maintain that He preached for one year only, and then suffered in the twelfth month. [In speaking thus,] they are forgetful to their own disadvantage, destroying His whole work, and robbing Him of that age which is both more necessary and more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> than any other; that more advanced age, I mean, during which also as a teacher He excelled all others. For how could He have had <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if He did not teach? And how could He have taught, unless He had reached the age of a Master? For when He came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, He had not yet completed His thirtieth year, but was beginning to be about thirty years of age (for thus Luke, who has mentioned His years, has expressed it: <q>Now Jesus was, as it were, beginning to be thirty years old,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013139"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;3:23</a></span> when He came to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>); and, [according to these men,] He preached only one year reckoning from His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. On completing His thirtieth year He suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age. Now, that the first  stage of early life embraces thirty years,  and that this extends onwards to the fortieth year, every one will admit; but from the fortieth and fiftieth year a man begins to decline towards old age, which our Lord possessed while He still fulfilled the office of a Teacher, even as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and all the elders testify; those who were conversant in Asia with John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord, [affirming] that John conveyed to them that information.  And he remained among them up to the times of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>.  Some of them, moreover, saw not only John, but the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also, and heard the very same account from them, and bear testimony as to the [validity of] the statement. Whom then should we rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Whether such men as these, or Ptolem&aelig;us, who never saw the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and who never even in his dreams attained to the slightest trace of an apostle?</p>

<p>6. But, besides this, those very <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who then disputed with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> have most clearly indicated the same thing. For when the Lord said to them, <q>Your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glad,</q> they answered Him, <q>You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013143"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56-57</a></span> Now, such language is fittingly applied to one who has already passed the age of forty, without having as yet reached his fiftieth year, yet is not far from this latter period. But to one who is only thirty years old it would unquestionably be said, <q>You are not yet forty years old.</q> For those who wished to convict Him of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> would certainly not extend the number of His years far beyond the age which they saw He had attained; but they mentioned a period near His real age, whether they had <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ascertained this out of the entry in the public register, or simply made a conjecture from what they observed that He was above forty years old, and that He certainly was not one of only thirty years of age. For it is altogether unreasonable to suppose that they were mistaken by twenty years, when they wished to prove Him younger than the times of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. For what they saw, that they also expressed; and He whom they beheld was not a mere phantasm, but an actual being  of flesh and blood. He did not then want much of being fifty years old;  and, in accordance with that fact, they said to Him, <q>You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>?</q> He did not therefore preach only for one year, nor did He suffer in the twelfth month of the year. For the period included between the thirtieth and the fiftieth year can never be regarded as <em>one</em> year, unless indeed, among their <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, there be so long years assigned to those who sit in their ranks with Bythus in the Pleroma; of which beings Homer the poet, too, has spoken, doubtless being inspired by the Mother of their [system of] <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><span class="greek">&#x039F;&#x1F31; &#x03B4;&#x1F72; &#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x1F76; &#x03C0;&#x1F70;&#x03C1; &#x0396;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;&#x1F76; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03B9; &#x1F20;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;</span> <br><span class="greek">&#x03A7;&#x03C1;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x1FF3; &#x1F10;&#x03BD; &#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x1F73;&#x03B4;&#x1FF3;:</span> </p></blockquote>

<p>which we may thus render:</p> <blockquote><p><q>The gods sat round, while Jove presided o'er,<br>And converse held upon the golden floor.</q></p></blockquote>
