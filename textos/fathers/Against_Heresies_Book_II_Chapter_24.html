<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 24)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Folly of the arguments derived by the heretics from numbers, letters, and syllables.</span>

<p>1. This very thing, too, still further demonstrates their opinion false, and their fictitious system untenable, that they endeavour to bring forward <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of it, sometimes through means of numbers and the syllables of names, sometimes also through the letter of syllables, and yet again through those numbers which are, according to the practice followed by the Greeks, contained in [different] letters&mdash;[this, I say,] demonstrates in the clearest manner their overthrow or confusion,  as well as the untenable and perverse character of their [professed] <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For, transferring the name <em>Jesus</em>, which belongs to another language, to the numeration of the Greeks, they sometimes call it <q>Episemon,</q>  as having six letters, and at other times <q>the Plenitude of the Ogdoads,</q> as containing the number eight hundred and eighty-eight. But His [corresponding] Greek name, which is <q>Soter,</q> that is, <em>Saviour</em>, because it does not fit in with their system, either with respect to numerical value or as regards its letters, they pass over in silence. Yet surely, if they regard the names of the Lord, as, in accordance with the preconceived purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by means of their numerical value and letters, indicating number in the Pleroma, <em>Soter</em>, as being a Greek name, ought by means of its letters and the numbers [expressed by these], in virtue of its being Greek, to show forth the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Pleroma. But the case is not so, because it is a word of five letters, and its numerical value is one thousand four hundred and eight.  But these things do not in any way correspond with their Pleroma; the account, therefore, which they give of transactions in the Pleroma cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<p>2. Moreover, <em>Jesus</em>, which is a word belonging to the proper tongue of the Hebrews, contains, as the learned among them declare, two letters and a half,  and signifies that Lord who contains heaven and earth;  for <em>Jesus</em> in the ancient Hebrew language means <q>heaven,</q> while again <q>earth</q> is expressed by the words <em>sura usser</em>.  The word, therefore, which contains heaven and earth is just <em>Jesus</em>. Their explanation, then, of the <em>Episemon</em> is false, and their numerical calculation is also manifestly overthrown. For, in their own language, <em>Soter</em> is a Greek word of five letters; but, on the other hand, in the Hebrew tongue, <em>Jesus</em> contains only two letters and a half. The total which they reckon up, viz., eight hundred and eighty-eight, therefore falls to the ground. And throughout, the Hebrew letters do not correspond in number with the Greek, although these especially, as being the more ancient and unchanging, ought to uphold the reckoning connected with the names. For these ancient, original, and generally called <em>sacred</em> letters  of the Hebrews are ten in number (but they are written by means of fifteen ), the last letter  being joined to the first. And thus they write some of these letters according to their natural sequence, just as we do, but others in a reverse direction, from the right hand towards the left, thus tracing the letters backwards. The name <em>Christ</em>, too, ought to be capable of being reckoned up in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> of their Pleroma, inasmuch as, according to their statements, He was produced for the establishment and rectification of their Pleroma. The Father, too, in the same way, ought, both by means of letters and numerical value, to contain the number of those <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> who were produced by Him; Bythus, in like manner, and not less Monogenes; but pre-eminently the name which is above all others, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is called, and which in the Hebrew tongue is expressed by <em>Baruch</em>,  [a word] which also contains two and a half letters. From this fact, therefore, that the more important names, both in the Hebrew and Greek languages, do not conform to their system, either as respects the number of letters or the reckoning brought out of them, the forced character of their calculations respecting the rest becomes clearly manifest.</p>

<p>3. For, choosing out of the law whatever things agree with the number adopted in their system, they thus violently strive to obtain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of its validity. But if it was really the purpose of their Mother, or the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, to set forth, by means of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, types of those things which are in the Pleroma, they should have taken care that the types were found in things more exactly correspondent and more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and, above all, in the case of the Ark of the Covenant, on account of which the whole tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was formed. Now it was constructed thus: its length <span class="stiki" id="note013160"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;25:10</a></span> was two cubits and a half, its breadth one cubit and a half, its height one cubit and a half; but such a number of cubits in no respect corresponds with their system, yet by it the type ought to have been, beyond everything else, clearly set forth. The mercy-seat <span class="stiki" id="note013161"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse17">Exodus&nbsp;25:17</a></span> also does in like manner not at all harmonize with their expositions. Moreover, the table of <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a> <span class="stiki" id="note013162"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse23">Exodus&nbsp;25:23</a></span> was two cubits in length, while its height was a cubit and a half. These stood before the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, and yet in them not a single number is of such an amount as contains an indication of the Tetrad, or the Ogdoad, or of the rest of their Pleroma. What of the candlestick, <span class="stiki" id="note013163"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse31">Exodus&nbsp;25:31</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> too, which had seven  branches and seven lamps? While, if these had been made according to the type, it ought to have had eight branches and a like number of lamps, after the type of the primary Ogdoad, which shines pre-eminently among the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, and illuminates the whole Pleroma. They have carefully enumerated the curtains <span class="stiki" id="note013165"><a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;26:1</a></span> as being ten, declaring these a type of the ten <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>; but they have forgotten to count the coverings of skin, which were eleven <span class="stiki" id="note013166"><a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;26:7</a></span> in number. Nor, again, have they measured the size of these very curtains, each curtain <span class="stiki" id="note013167"><a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;26:2</a></span> being eight-and-twenty cubits in length. And they set forth the length of the pillars as being ten cubits, with a reference to the Decad of <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. <q>But the breadth of each pillar was a cubit and a half;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013168"><a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse16">Exodus&nbsp;26:16</a></span> and this they do not explain, any more than they do the entire number of the pillars or of their bars, because that does not suit the argument. But what of the anointing oil, <span class="stiki" id="note013169"><a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse26">Exodus&nbsp;26:26</a></span> which sanctified the whole tabernacle? Perhaps it escaped the notice of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, or, while their Mother was sleeping, the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> of himself gave instructions as to its weight; and on this account it is out of harmony with their Pleroma, consisting, <span class="stiki" id="note013170"><a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse23">Exodus&nbsp;30:23</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> as it did, of five hundred shekels of myrrh, five hundred of cassia, two hundred and fifty of cinnamon, two hundred and fifty of calamus, and oil in addition, so that it was composed of five ingredients. The <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> <span class="stiki" id="note013171"><a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse34">Exodus&nbsp;30:34</a></span> also, in like manner, [was compounded] of stacte, onycha, galbanum, mint, and frankincense, all which do in no respect, either as to their mixture or weight, harmonize with their argument. It is therefore unreasonable and altogether absurd [to maintain] that the types were not preserved in the sublime and more imposing enactments of the law; but in other points, when any number coincides with their assertions, to affirm that it was a type of the things in the Pleroma; while [the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, that] every number occurs with the utmost variety in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, so that, should any one desire it, he might form not only an Ogdoad, and a Decad, and a Duodecad, but any sort of number from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and then maintain that this was a type of the system of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> devised by himself.</p>

<p>4. But that this point is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that that number which is called <em>five</em>, which agrees in no respect with their argument, and does not harmonize with their system, nor is suitable for a typical manifestation of the things in the Pleroma, [yet has a wide prevalence, ] will be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> as follows from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Soter is a name of  five letters; Pater, too, contains five letters; Agape (<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>), too, consists of five letters; and our Lord, after  blessing the five loaves, fed with them five thousand men. Five <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> <span class="stiki" id="note013174"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;25:2</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> were called wise by the Lord; and, in like manner, five were styled foolish. Again, five men are said to have been with the Lord when He obtained testimony <span class="stiki" id="note013175"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;17:1</a></span> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>&mdash;namely, Peter, and James, and John, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Elias. The Lord also, as the fifth person, entered into the apartment of the dead maiden, and raised her up again; for, says [the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>], <q>He suffered no man to go in, save Peter and James,  and the father and mother of the maiden.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013177"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse51">Luke&nbsp;8:51</a></span> The rich man in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> <span class="stiki" id="note013178"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;16:28</a></span> declared that he had five brothers, to whom he desired that one rising from the dead should go. The pool from which the Lord commanded the paralytic man to go into his house, had five porches. The very form of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, too, has five extremities,  two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails. Each of our hands has five fingers; we have also five senses; our internal organs may also be reckoned as five, viz., the heart, the liver, the lungs, the spleen, and the kidneys. Moreover, even the whole person may be divided into this number [of parts]&mdash;the head, the breast, the belly, the thighs, and the feet. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> passes through five ages first infancy, then boyhood, then youth, then maturity,  and then old age. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> delivered the law to the people in five books. Each table which he received from God contained five  commandments. The veil covering <span class="stiki" id="note013182"><a href="../bible/exo026.htm#verse37">Exodus&nbsp;26:37</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies had five pillars. The altar of burnt-offering also was five cubits in breadth.  Five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were chosen in the wilderness&mdash;namely, <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note013184"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;28:1</a></span> Nadab, Abiud, Eleazar, Ithamar. The ephod and the breastplate, and other sacerdotal vestments, were formed out of five <span class="stiki" id="note013185"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;28:5</a></span> materials; for they combined in themselves gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen. And there were five <span class="stiki" id="note013186"><a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse17">Joshua&nbsp;10:17</a></span> kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua the son of Nun shut up in a cave, and directed the people to trample upon their heads. Any one, in fact, might collect many thousand other things of the same kind, both with respect to this number and any other he chose to fix upon, either from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, or from the works of nature lying under his observation.  But although such is the case, we do not therefore affirm that there are five <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> above the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>; nor do we consecrate the Pentad, as if it were some divine thing; nor do we strive to establish things that are untenable, nor ravings [such as they indulge in], by means of that vain kind of labour; nor do we perversely force a creation well adapted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [for the ends intended to be served], to change itself into types of things which have no real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; nor do we seek to bring forward impious and abominable doctrines, the detection and overthrow of which are easy to all possessed of intelligence.</p>

<p>5. For who can concede to them that the year has three hundred and sixty-five days only, in order that there may be twelve months of thirty days each, after the type of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, when the type is in fact altogether out of harmony [with the antitype]? For, in the one case, each of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> is a thirtieth part of the entire Pleroma, while in the other they declare that a month is the twelfth part of a year. If, indeed, the year were divided into thirty parts, and the month into twelve, then a fitting type might be regarded as having been found for their fictitious system. But, on the contrary, as the case really stands, their Pleroma is divided into thirty parts, and a portion of it into twelve; while again the whole year is divided into twelve parts, and a certain portion of it into thirty. The Saviour therefore acted unwisely in constituting the month a type of the entire Pleroma, but the year a type only of that Duodecad which exists in the Pleroma; for it was more fitting to divide the year into thirty parts, even as the whole Pleroma is divided, but the month into twelve, just as the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are in their Pleroma. Moreover, they divide the entire Pleroma into three portions&mdash;namely, into an Ogdoad, a Decad, and a Duodecad. But our year is divided into four parts, &mdash; namely, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. And again, not even do the months, which they maintain to be a type of the Triacontad, consist precisely of thirty days, but some have more and some less, inasmuch as five days remain to them as an overplus.  The day, too, does not always consist precisely of twelve hours, but rises from nine  to fifteen, and then falls again from fifteen to nine. It cannot therefore be held that months of thirty days each were so formed for the sake of [typifying]  the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>; for, in that case, they would have consisted precisely of thirty days: nor, again, the days of these months, that by means of twelve hours they might symbolize the twelve <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>; for, in that case, they would always have consisted precisely of twelve hours.</p>

<p>6. But further, as to their calling material substances <q>on the left hand,</q> and maintaining that those things which are thus on the left hand of necessity fall into corruption, while they also affirm that the Saviour came to the lost sheep, in order to transfer it to the right hand, that is, to the ninety and nine sheep which were in safety, and perished not, but continued within the fold, yet were of the left hand,  it follows that they must acknowledge that the enjoyment  of rest did not imply <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And that which has not in like manner the same number, they will be compelled to acknowledge as belonging to the left hand, that is, to corruption. This Greek word <em>Agape</em> (<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>), then, according to the letters of the Greeks, by means of which reckoning is carried on among them, having a numerical value of <em>ninety-three</em>,  is in like manner assigned to the place of rest on the left hand. Aletheia (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>), too, having in like manner, according to the principle indicated above, a numerical value of sixty-four,  exists among material substances. And thus, in fine, they will be compelled to acknowledge that all those sacred names which do not reach a numerical value of one hundred, but only contain the numbers summed by the left hand, are corruptible and material.</p>
