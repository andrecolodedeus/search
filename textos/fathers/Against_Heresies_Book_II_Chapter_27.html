<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 27)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Proper mode of interpreting parables and obscure passages of Scripture.</span>

<p>1. A sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and one which does not expose its possessor to danger, and is devoted to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, will eagerly meditate upon those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has placed within the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and has subjected to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and will make advancement in [acquaintance with] them, rendering the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them easy to him by means of daily study. These things are such as fall [plainly] under our observation, and are clearly and unambiguously in express terms set forth in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> ought not to be adapted to ambiguous expressions. For, if this be not done, both he who explains them will do so without danger, and the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> will receive a like interpretation from all, and the body  of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> remains entire, with a harmonious adaptation of its members, and without any collision [of its several parts]. But to apply expressions which are not clear or evident to interpretations of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, such as every one discovers for himself as inclination leads him, [is absurd. ] For in this way no one will possess the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but in accordance with the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who explain the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> will be found the various systems of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in mutual opposition to each other, and setting forth antagonistic doctrines, like the questions current among the Gentile <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>.</p>

<p>2. According to this course of procedure, therefore, man would always be inquiring but never finding, because he has rejected the very method of discovery. And when the Bridegroom <span class="stiki" id="note013209"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;25:5</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> comes, he who has his lamp untrimmed, and not burning with the brightness of a steady light, is classed among those who obscure the interpretations of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, forsaking Him who by His plain announcements freely imparts gifts to all who come to Him, and is excluded from His marriage-chamber. Since, therefore, the entire Scriptures, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, can be clearly, unambiguously, and harmoniously understood by all, although all do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them; and  since they proclaim that one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the exclusion of all others, formed all things by His word, whether visible or invisible, heavenly or earthly, in the water or under the earth, as I have shown  from the very words of Scripture; and since the very system of creation to which we belong testifies, by what falls under our notice, that one Being made and governs it&mdash;those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> will seem <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> foolish who blind their eyes to such a clear demonstration, and will not behold the light of the announcement [made to them]; but they put fetters upon themselves, and every one of them imagines, by means of their obscure interpretations of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, that he has found out a God of his own. For that there is nothing whatever openly, expressly, and without controversy said in any part of Scripture respecting the Father conceived of by those who hold a contrary opinion, they themselves testify, when they maintain that the Saviour privately taught these same things not to all, but to certain only of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who could comprehend them, and who understood what was intended by Him through means of arguments, enigmas, and <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>. They come, [in fine,] to this, that they maintain there is one Being who is proclaimed as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and another as Father, He who is set forth as such through means of <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and enigmas.</p>

<p>  3. But since <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> admit of many interpretations, what lover of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will not acknowledge, that for them to assert God is to be searched out from these, while they desert what is certain, indubitable, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is the part of men who eagerly throw themselves into danger, and act as if destitute of reason? And is not such a course of conduct not to build one's house upon a rock <span class="stiki" id="note013212"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;7:25</a></span> which is firm, strong, and placed in an open position, but upon the shifting sand? Hence the overthrow of such a building is a matter of ease.</p>
