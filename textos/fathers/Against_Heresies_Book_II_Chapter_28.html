<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 28)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Perfect knowledge cannot be attained in the present life: many questions must be submissively left in the hands of God.</span>

<p>1. Having therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself as our rule and the testimony concerning God set clearly before us, we ought not, by running after numerous and diverse answers to questions, to cast away the firm and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is much more suitable that we, directing our inquiries after this fashion, should exercise ourselves in the investigation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and administration of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and should increase in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Him who has done, and still does, so great things for us; but never should fall from the belief by which it is most clearly proclaimed that this Being alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God and Father, who both formed this world, fashioned man, and bestowed the faculty of increase on His own creation, and called him upwards from lesser things to those greater ones which are in His own presence, just as He brings an infant which has been conceived in the womb into the light of the sun, and lays up wheat in the barn after He has given it full strength on the stalk. But it is one and the same Creator who both fashioned the womb and created the sun; and one and the same Lord who both reared the stalk of grain, increased and multiplied the wheat, and prepared the barn.</p>

<p>2. If, however, we cannot discover explanations of all those things in Scripture which are made the subject of investigation, yet let us not on that account seek after any other God besides Him who really exists. For this is the very greatest impiety. We should leave things of that nature to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who created us, being most properly assured that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are indeed perfect, since they were spoken by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and His Spirit; but we, inasmuch as we are inferior to, and later in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> than, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and His Spirit, are on that very account  destitute of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. And there is no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for wonder if this is the case with us as respects things spiritual and heavenly, and such as require to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us by revelation, since many even of those things which lie at our very feet (I mean such as belong to this world, which we handle, and see, and are in close contact with) transcend our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that even these we must leave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is fitting that He should excel all [in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>]. For how stands the case, for instance, if we endeavour to explain the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the rising of the Nile? We may say a great deal, plausible or otherwise, on the subject; but what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, sure, and incontrovertible regarding it, belongs only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then, again, the dwelling-place of birds&mdash; of those, I mean, which come to us in spring, but fly away again on the approach of autumn&mdash; though it is a matter connected with this world, escapes our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. What explanation, again, can we give of the flow and ebb of the ocean, although every one admits there must be a certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> [for these phenomena]? Or what can we say as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of those things which lie beyond it?  What, moreover, can we say as to the formation of rain, lightning, thunder, gatherings of clouds, vapours, the bursting forth of winds, and such like things; or tell as to the storehouses of snow, hail, and other like things? [What do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> respecting] the conditions requisite for the preparation of clouds, or what is the real nature of the vapours in the sky? What as to the reason why the moon waxes and wanes, or what as to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the difference of nature among various waters, metals, stones, and such like things? On all these points we may indeed say a great deal while we search into their causes, but God alone who made them can declare the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> regarding them.</p>

<p>3. If, therefore, even with respect to creation, there are some things [the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of] which belongs only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and others which come within the range of our own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, what ground is there for complaint, if, in regard to those things which we investigate in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> (which are throughout spiritual), we are able by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God to explain some of them, while we must leave others in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that not only in the present world, but also in that which is to come, so that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should for ever teach, and man should for ever learn the things taught him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? As the apostle has said on this point, that, when other things have been done away, then these three, <q><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity, shall endure.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013215"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:13</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which has respect to our Master, endures  unchangeably,  assuring us that there is but one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that we should <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him for ever, seeing that He alone is our Father; while we hope ever to be receiving more and more from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to learn from Him, because He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and possesses boundless riches, a kingdom without end, and instruction that can never be exhausted. If, therefore, according to the rule which I have stated, we leave some questions in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we shall both preserve our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> uninjured, and shall continue without danger; and all Scripture, which has been given to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall be found by us perfectly consistent; and the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> shall harmonize with those passages which are perfectly plain; and those statements the meaning of which is clear, shall serve to explain the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>; and through the many diversified utterances [of Scripture] there shall be heard  one harmonious melody in us, praising in <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> that God who created all things. If, for instance, any one asks, <q>What was God doing before He made the world?</q> we reply that the answer to such a question lies with God Himself. For that this world was formed perfect  by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, receiving a beginning in time, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> teach us; but no Scripture reveals to us what God was employed about before this event. The answer therefore to that question remains with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it is not proper  for us to aim at bringing forward foolish, rash, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> suppositions [in reply to it]; so, as by one's imagining that he has discovered the origin of matter, he should in reality set aside God Himself who made all things.</p>

<p>4. For consider, all you who invent such opinions, since the Father Himself is alone called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has a real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but whom you style the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>; since, moreover, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> acknowledge Him alone as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and yet again, since the Lord confesses Him alone as His own Father, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no other, as I shall show from His very words, &mdash; when you style this very Being the fruit of defect, and the offspring of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and describe Him as being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of those things which are above Him, with the various other allegations which you make regarding Him&mdash;consider the terrible <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> [you are thus guilty of] against Him who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You seem to affirm gravely and honestly enough that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but then, as you are utterly unable to reveal any other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you declare this very Being in whom you profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, the fruit of defect and the offspring of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Now this blindness and foolish talking flow to you from the fact that you reserve nothing for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but you wish to proclaim the nativity and production both of God Himself, of His Enn&oelig;a, of His <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, and Life, and Christ; and you form the idea of these from no other than a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> experience; not understanding, as I said before, that it is possible, in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is a compound being, to speak in this way of the mind of man and the thought of man; and to say that thought (enn&oelig;a) springs from mind (sensus), intention (enthymesis) again from thought, and word (logos) from intention (but which logos?  for there is among the Greeks one logos which is the principle that thinks, and another which is the instrument by means of which thought is expressed); and [to say] that a man sometimes is at rest and silent, while at other times he speaks and is active. But since God is  all <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, all reason, all active spirit, all light, and always exists one and the same, as it is both beneficial for us to think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as we learn regarding Him from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, such feelings and divisions [of operation] cannot fittingly be ascribed to Him. For our tongue, as being carnal, is not sufficient to minister to the rapidity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, inasmuch as that is of a spiritual nature, for which reason our word is restrained  within us, and is not at once expressed as it has been conceived by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but is uttered by successive efforts, just as the tongue is able to serve it.</p>

<p>5. But God being all Mind, and all <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, both speaks exactly what He thinks, and thinks exactly what He speaks. For His thought is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> is Mind, and Mind comprehending all things is the Father Himself. He, therefore, who speaks of the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and ascribes to it a special origin of its own, declares Him a compound Being, as if God were one thing, and the original Mind another. So, again, with respect to <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, when one attributes to him the third  place of production from the Father; on which supposition he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of His greatness; and thus <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> has been far separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As for the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, he declares respecting Him, <q>Who shall describe His generation?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013224"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> But you pretend to set forth His generation from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and you transfer the production of the word of men which takes place by means of a tongue to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and thus are righteously exposed by your own  selves as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> neither things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> nor divine.</p>

<p>6. But, beyond reason inflated [with your own wisdom], you presumptuously maintain that you are acquainted with the unspeakable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while even the Lord, the very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, allowed that the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the very day and hour of judgment, when He plainly declares, <q>But of that day and that hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, neither the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father only.</q>  If, then, the Son was not ashamed to ascribe the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that day to the Father only, but declared what was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> regarding the matter, neither let us be ashamed to reserve for God those greater questions which may occur to us. For no man is superior to his master. <span class="stiki" id="note013226"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;10:24</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;11:40</a></span> If any one, therefore, says to us, <q>How then was the Son produced by the Father?</q> we reply to him, that no man understands that production, or generation, or calling, or revelation, or by whatever name one may describe His generation, which is in fact altogether indescribable. Neither <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, nor Saturninus, nor <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor archangels, nor principalities, nor powers [possess this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>], but the Father only who begot, and the Son who was begotten. Since therefore His generation is unspeakable, those who strive to set forth generations and productions cannot be in their right <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, inasmuch as they undertake to describe things which are indescribable. For that a word is uttered at the bidding of thought and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> indeed well understand. Those, therefore, who have excogitated [the theory of] emissions have not discovered anything great, or revealed any abstruse <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, when they have simply transferred what all understand to the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; and while they style Him unspeakable and unnameable, they nevertheless set forth the production and formation of His first generation, as if they themselves had assisted at His birth, thus assimilating Him to the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> formed by emissions.</p>

<p>7. But we shall not be wrong if we affirm the same thing also concerning the substance of matter, that God produced it. For we have learned from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that God holds the supremacy over all things. But whence or in what way He produced it, neither has Scripture anywhere declared; nor does it become us to conjecture, so as, in accordance with our own opinions, to form endless conjectures concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but we should leave such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the hands of God Himself. In like manner, also, we must leave the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why, while all things were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, certain of His creatures <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and revolted from a state of submission to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and others, indeed the great majority, persevered, and do still persevere, in [willing] subjection to Him who formed them, and also of what nature those are who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and of what nature those who persevere&mdash;[we must, I say, leave the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these things] to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His Word, to whom alone He said, <q>Sit at my right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool.</q>  But as for us, we still dwell upon the earth, and have not yet sat down upon His throne. For although the Spirit of the Saviour that is in Him <q>searches all things, even the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013228"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> yet as to us <q>there are diversities of gifts, differences of administrations, and diversities of operations;</q>  and we, while upon the earth, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also declares, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, and prophesy in part.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013230"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:9</a></span> Since, therefore, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> but in part, we ought to leave all sorts of [difficult] questions in the hands of Him who in some measure, [and that only,] bestows <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on us. That <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, [for instance,] is prepared for sinners, both the Lord has plainly declared, and the rest of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> demonstrate. And that God foreknew that this would happen, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> do in like manner demonstrate, since He prepared <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> from the beginning for those who were [afterwards] to transgress [His commandments]; but the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> itself of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of such transgressors neither has any Scripture informed us, nor has an apostle told us, nor has the Lord taught us. It becomes us, therefore, to leave the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this matter to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as the Lord does of the day and hour [of judgment], and not to rush to such an extreme of danger, that we will leave nothing in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even though we have received only a measure of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> [from Him in this world]. But when we investigate points which are above us, and with respect to which we cannot reach satisfaction, [it is absurd ] that we should display such an extreme of presumption as to lay open <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and things which are not yet discovered,  as if already we had found out, by the vain talk about emissions, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, the Creator of all things, and to assert that He derived His substance from <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, so as to frame an impious hypothesis in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>8. Moreover, they possess no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their system, which has but recently been invented by them, sometimes resting upon certain numbers, sometimes on syllables, and sometimes, again, on names; and there are occasions, too, when,  by means of those letters which are contained in letters, by <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> not properly interpreted, or by certain [baseless] conjectures, they strive to establish that fabulous account which they have devised. For if any one should inquire the reason why the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who has fellowship with the Son in all things, has been declared by the Lord alone to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the hour and the day [of judgment], he will find at present no more suitable, or becoming, or safe reason than this (since, indeed, the Lord is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Master), that we may learn through Him that the Father is above all things. For <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> says He, <q>is greater than I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013233"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> The Father, therefore, has been declared by our Lord to excel with respect to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for this reason, that we, too, as long as we are connected with the scheme of things in this world, should leave perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and such questions [as have been mentioned], to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and should not by any chance, while we seek to investigate the sublime nature of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, fall into the danger of starting the question whether there is another God above God. </p>

<p>9. But if any lover of strife contradict what I have said, and also what the apostle affirms, that <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, and prophesy in part,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013235"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:9</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he has acquired not a partial, but a universal, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all that exists, &mdash; being such an one as <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, or Ptolem&aelig;us, or <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, or any other of those who maintain that they have searched out the deep  things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;let him not (arraying himself in vainglory) boast that he has acquired greater <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than others with respect to those things which are invisible, or cannot be placed under our observation; but let him, by making diligent inquiry, and obtaining information from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, tell us the reasons (which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not) of those things which are in this world, &mdash; as, for instance, the number of hairs on his own head, and the sparrows which are captured day by day, and such other points with which we are not previously acquainted&mdash;so that we may credit him also with respect to more important points. But if those who are <em>perfect</em> do not yet understand the very things in their hands, and at their feet, and before their eyes, and on the earth, and especially the rule followed with respect to the hairs of their head, how can we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them regarding things spiritual, and super-celestial,  and those which, with a vain confidence, they assert to be above God? So much, then, I have said concerning numbers, and names, and syllables, and questions respecting such things as are above our comprehension, and concerning their improper expositions of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>: [I add no more on these points,] since you yourself may enlarge upon them.</p>
