<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 30)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Absurdity of their styling themselves spiritual, while the Demiurge is declared to be animal.</span>

<p>1. Such being the state of the case, these infatuated men declare that they rise above the Creator (<a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>); and, inasmuch as they proclaim themselves superior to that God who made and adorned the heavens, and the earth, and all things that are in them, and maintain that they themselves are spiritual, while they are in fact shamefully carnal on account of their so great impiety&mdash;affirming that He, who has made His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>  spirits, and is clothed with light as with a garment, and holds the circle  of the earth, as it were, in His hand, in whose sight its inhabitants are counted as grasshoppers, and who is the Creator and Lord of all spiritual substance, is of an animal nature,&mdash; they do beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and verily betray their own <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; and, as if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> struck with thunder, even more than those giants who are spoken of in [<a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>] fables, they lift up their opinions against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inflated by a vain presumption and unstable <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash;men for whose purgation all the hellebore  on earth would not suffice, so that they should get rid of their intense folly.</p>

<p>2. The superior person is to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. In what way, then, can they show themselves superior to the Creator (that I too, through the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the argument in hand, may come down to the level of their impiety, instituting a comparison between God and foolish men, and, by descending to their argument, may often refute them by their own doctrines; but in thus acting may God be merciful to me, for I venture on these statements, not with the view of comparing Him to them, but of convicting and overthrowing their insane opinions)&mdash; they, for whom many foolish <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> entertain so great an admiration, as if, forsooth, they could learn from them something more precious than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself! That expression of Scripture, <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013248"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> they interpret as spoken with this view, that they should discover themselves to be above the Creator, styling themselves greater and better than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and calling themselves spiritual, but the Creator animal; and [affirming] that for this reason they rise upwards above <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for that  they enter in within the Pleroma, while He remains in the intermediate place. Let them, then, prove themselves by their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> superior to the Creator; for the superior person ought to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not by what is said, but by what has a real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</p>

<p>3. What work, then, will they point to as having been accomplished through themselves by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, or by their Mother, either greater, or more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, or more adorned with wisdom, than those which have been produced by Him who was the disposer of all around us? What heavens have they established? What earth have they founded? What stars have they called into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>? Or what lights of heaven have they caused to shine? Within what circles, moreover, have they confined them? Or, what rains, or frosts, or snows, each suited to the season, and to every special climate, have they brought upon the earth? And again, in opposition to these, what heat or dryness have they set over against them? Or, what rivers have they made to flow? What fountains have they brought forth? With what flowers and trees have they adorned this sublunary world? Or, what multitude of animals have they formed, some rational, and others irrational, but all adorned with beauty? And who can enumerate one by one all the remaining objects which have been constituted by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are governed by His wisdom? Or who can search out the greatness of that God who made them? And what can be told of those existences which are above heaven, and which do not pass away, such as Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, and Powers innumerable? Against what one of these works, then, do they set themselves in opposition? What have they similar to show, as having been made through themselves, or by themselves, since even they too are the Workmanship and creatures of this [Creator]? For whether the Saviour or their Mother (to use their own expressions, proving them false by means of the very terms they themselves employ) used this Being, as they maintain, to make an image of those things which are within the Pleroma, and of all those beings which she saw waiting upon the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, she used him (the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>) as being [in a sense] superior to herself, and better fitted to accomplish her purpose through his instrumentality; for she would by no means form the images of such important beings through means of an inferior, but by a superior, agent.</p>

<p>4. For, [be it observed,] they themselves, according to their own declarations, were then existing, as a spiritual conception, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of those beings who were arranged as satellites around Pandora. And they indeed continued useless, the Mother accomplishing nothing through their instrumentality, &mdash; an idle conception, owing their being to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and fit for nothing, for not a thing appears to have been done by them. But the God who, according to them, was produced, while, as they argue, inferior to themselves (for they maintain that he is of an animal nature), was nevertheless the active agent in all things, efficient, and fit for the work to be done, so that by him the images of all things were made; and not only were these things which are seen formed by him, but also all things invisible, Angels, Archangels, Dominations, Powers, and Virtues,&mdash; [by him, I say,] as being the superior, and capable of ministering to her desire. But it seems that the Mother made nothing whatever through their instrumentality, as indeed they themselves acknowledge; so that one may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reckon them as having been an <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a> produced by the painful travail of their Mother. For no accoucheurs performed their office upon her, and therefore they were cast forth as an <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a>, useful for nothing, and formed to accomplish no work of the Mother. And yet they describe themselves as being superior to Him by whom so vast and admirable works have been accomplished and arranged, although by their own reasoning they are found to be so wretchedly inferior!</p>

<p>5. It is as if there were two iron tools, or instruments, the one of which was continually in the workman's hands and in constant use, and by the use of which he made whatever he pleased, and displayed his art and skill, but the other of which remained idle and useless, never being called into operation, the workman never appearing to make anything by it, and making no use of it in any of his labours; and then one should maintain that this useless, and idle, and unemployed tool was superior in nature and value to that which the artisan employed in his work, and by means of which he acquired his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if any such were found, would <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be regarded as imbecile, and not in his right mind. And so should those be judged of who speak of themselves as being spiritual and superior, and of the Creator as possessed of an animal nature, and maintain that for this reason they will ascend on high, and penetrate within the Pleroma to their own husbands (for, according to their own statements, they are themselves feminine), but that God [the Creator] is of an inferior nature, and therefore remains in the intermediate place, while all the time they bring forward no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of these assertions: for the better man is shown by his works, and all works have been accomplished by the Creator; but they, having nothing worthy of reason to point to as having been produced by themselves, are  labouring under the greatest and most incurable <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>.</p>

<p>6. If, however, they labour to maintain that, while all material things, such as the heaven, and the whole world which exists below it, were indeed formed by the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, yet all things of a more spiritual nature than these, &mdash; those, namely, which are above the heavens, such as Principalities, Powers, Angels, Archangels, Dominations, Virtues,&mdash; were produced by a spiritual process of birth (which they declare themselves to be), then, in the first place, we prove from the authoritative Scriptures  that all the things which have been mentioned, visible and invisible, have been made by one God. For these men are not more to be depended on than the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; nor ought we to give up the declarations of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who have proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and give credit to them, who do indeed utter nothing of a sensible nature, but rave about untenable opinions. And, in the next place, if those things which are above the heavens were really made through their instrumentality, then let them inform us what is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things invisible, recount the number of the Angels, and the ranks of the Archangels, reveal the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Thrones, and teach us the differences between the Dominations, Principalities, Powers, and Virtues. But they can say nothing respecting them; therefore these beings were not made by them. If, on the other hand, these were made by the Creator, as was really the case, and are of a spiritual and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> character, then it follows that He who produced spiritual beings is not Himself of an animal nature, and thus their fearful system of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is overthrown.</p>

<p>7. For that there are spiritual creatures in the heavens, all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> loudly proclaim; and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> expressly testifies that there are spiritual things when he declares that he was caught up into the third heaven,  and again, that he was carried away to paradise, and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter. But what did that profit him, either his entrance into paradise or his assumption into the third heaven, since all these things are still but under the power of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, if, as some venture to maintain, he had already begun  to be a spectator and a hearer of those <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which are affirmed to be above the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>? For if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he was becoming acquainted with that order of things which is above the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, he would by no means have remained in the regions of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and that so as not even thoroughly to explore even these (for, according to their manner of speaking, there still lay before him four heavens,  if he were to approach the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and thus behold the whole seven lying beneath him); but he might have been admitted, perhaps, into the intermediate place, that is, into the presence of the Mother, that he might receive instruction from her as to the things within the Pleroma. For that inner man which was in him, and spoke in him, as they say, though invisible, could have attained not only to the third heaven, but even as far as the presence of their Mother. For if they maintain that they themselves, that is, their [inner] man, at once ascends above the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and departs to the Mother, much more must this have occurred to the [inner] man of the apostle; for the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> would not have hindered him, being, as they assert, himself already subject to the Saviour. But if he had tried to hinder him, the effort would have gone for nothing. For it is not possible that he should prove stronger than the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that when the inner man is said to be invisible even to the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>. But since he (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) has described that assumption of himself up to the third heaven as something great and pre-eminent, it cannot be that these men ascend above the seventh heaven, for they are certainly not superior to the apostle. If they do maintain that they are more excellent than he, let them prove themselves so by their works, for they have never pretended to anything like [what he describes as occurring to himself]. And for this reason he added, <q>Whether in the body, or whether out of the body, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>,</q>  that the body might neither be thought to be a partaker in that vision,  as if it could have participated in those things which it had seen and heard; nor, again, that any one should say that he was not carried higher on account of the weight of the body; but it is therefore thus far permitted even without the body to behold spiritual <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which are the operations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made the heavens and the earth, and formed man, and placed him in paradise, so that those should be spectators of them who, like the apostle, have reached a high degree of perfection in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>8. This Being, therefore, also made spiritual things, of which, as far as to the third heaven, the apostle was made a spectator, and heard unspeakable  words which it is not possible for a man to utter, inasmuch as they are spiritual; and He Himself bestows  [gifts] on the worthy as inclination prompts Him, for paradise is His; and He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and not an animal <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, otherwise He should never have created spiritual things. But if He really is of an animal nature, then let them inform us by whom spiritual things were made. They have no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> which they can give that this was done by means of the travail of their Mother, which they declare themselves to be. For, not to speak of spiritual things, these men cannot create even a fly, or a gnat, or any other small and insignificant animal, without observing that law by which from the beginning animals have been and are naturally produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &mdash; through the deposition of seed in those that are of the same species. Nor was anything formed by the Mother alone; [for] they say that this <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> was produced by her, and that <em>he</em> was the Lord (the author) of all creation. And they maintain that he who is the Creator and Lord of all that has been made is of an animal nature, while they assert that they themselves are spiritual,&mdash; they who are neither the authors nor lords of any one work, not only of those things which are extraneous to them, but not even of their own bodies! Moreover, these men, who call themselves spiritual, and superior to the Creator, do often suffer much bodily pain, sorely against their will.</p>

<p>9. Justly, therefore, do we convict them of having departed far and wide from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For if the Saviour formed the things which have been made, by means of him (the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>), he is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in that case not to be inferior but superior to them, since he is found to have been the former even of themselves; for they, too, have a place among <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. How, then, can it be argued that these men indeed are spiritual, but that he by whom they were created is of an animal nature? Or, again, if (which is indeed the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> supposition, as I have shown by numerous arguments of the very clearest nature) He (the Creator) made all things freely, and by His own power, and arranged and finished them, and His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the substance  of all things, then He is discovered to be the one only God who created all things, who alone is Omnipotent, and who is the only Father rounding and forming all things, visible and invisible, such as may be perceived by our senses and such as cannot, heavenly and earthly, <q>by the word of His power;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013258"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and He has fitted and arranged all things by His wisdom, while He contains all things, but He Himself can be contained by no one: He is the Former, He the Builder, He the Discoverer, He the Creator, He the Lord of all; and there is no one besides Him, or above Him, neither has He any mother, as they <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribe to Him; nor is there a second <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> has imagined; nor is there a Pleroma of thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, which has been shown a vain supposition; nor is there any such being as Bythus or Proarche; nor are there a series of heavens; nor is there a virginal light,  nor an unnameable <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, nor, in fact, any one of those things which are madly dreamt of by these, and by all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But there is one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator&mdash; He who is above every Principality, and Power, and Dominion, and Virtue: He is Father, He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He the Founder, He the Maker, He the Creator, who made those things by Himself, that is, through His Word and His Wisdom&mdash; heaven and earth, and the seas, and all things that are in them: He is just; He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; He it is who formed man, who planted paradise, who made the world, who gave rise to the flood, who saved <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>; He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the living: He it is whom the law proclaims, whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> preach, whom Christ reveals, whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>  to us, and in whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> believes. He is the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>: through His Word, who is His Son, through Him He is revealed and manifested to all to whom He is revealed; for those [only] <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him to whom the Son has revealed Him. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> co-existing with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from of old, yea, from the beginning, always reveals the Father to Angels, Archangels, Powers, Virtues, and all to whom He wills that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be revealed.</p>
