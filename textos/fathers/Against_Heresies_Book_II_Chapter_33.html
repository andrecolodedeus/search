<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 33)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Absurdity of the doctrine of the transmigration of souls.</span>

<p>1. We may subvert their doctrine as to transmigration from body to body by this fact, that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> remember nothing whatever of the events which took place in their previous states of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For if they were sent forth with this object, that they should have experience of every kind of action, they must of necessity retain a remembrance of those things which have been previously accomplished, that they might fill up those in which they were still deficient, and not by always hovering, without intermission, round the same pursuits, spend their labour wretchedly in vain (for the mere union of a body [with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>] could not altogether extinguish the memory and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of those things which had formerly been experienced ), and especially as they came [into the world] for this very purpose. For as, when the body is asleep and at rest, whatever things the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees by herself, and does in a vision, recollecting  many of these, she also communicates them to the body; and as it happens that, when one awakes, perhaps after a long time, he relates what he saw in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, so also would he undoubtedly remember those things which he did before he came into this particular body. For if that which is seen only for a very brief space of time, or has been conceived of simply in a phantasm, and by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, through means of a dream, is remembered after she has mingled again with the body, and been dispersed through all the members, much more would she remember those things in connection with which she stayed during so long a time, even throughout the whole period of a bypast life.</p>

<p>2. With reference to these objections, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, that ancient Athenian, who also was the first  to introduce this opinion, when he could not set them aside, invented the [notion of] a cup of oblivion, imagining that in this way he would escape this sort of difficulty. He attempted no kind of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> [of his supposition], but simply replied dogmatically [to the objection in question], that when <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> enter into this life, they are caused to drink of oblivion by that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who watches their entrance [into the world], before they effect an entrance into the bodies [assigned them]. It escaped him, that [by speaking thus] he fell into another greater perplexity. For if the cup of oblivion, after it has been drunk, can obliterate the memory of all the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that have been done, how, O <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, do you obtain the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this fact (since your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is now in the body), that, before it entered into the body, it was made to drink by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> a drug which caused oblivion? For if you have a remembrance of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and the cup, and the entrance [into life], you ought also to be acquainted with other things; but if, on the other hand, you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them, then there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the story of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, nor in the cup of oblivion prepared with art.</p>

<p>3. In opposition, again, to those who affirm that the body itself is the drug of oblivion, this observation may be made: How, then, does it come to pass, that whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees by her own instrumentality, both in dreams and by reflection or earnest mental exertion, while the body is passive, she remembers, and reports to her neighbours? But, again, if the body itself were [the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of] oblivion, then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as existing in the body, could not remember even those things which were perceived long ago either by means of the eyes or the ears; but, as soon as the eye was turned from the things looked at, the memory of them also would undoubtedly be destroyed. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as existing in the very [<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of] oblivion, could have no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of anything else than that only which it saw at the present moment. How, too, could it become acquainted with divine things, and retain a remembrance of them while existing in the body, since, as they maintain, the body itself is [the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of] oblivion? But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also, when they were upon the earth, remembered likewise, on their returning to their ordinary state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  whatever things they spiritually saw or heard in visions of heavenly objects, and related them to others. The body, therefore, does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to forget those things which have been spiritually witnessed; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> teaches the body, and shares with it the spiritual vision which it has enjoyed.</p>

<p>4. For the body is not possessed of greater power than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since indeed the former is inspired, and vivified, and increased, and held together by the latter; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possesses  and rules over the body. It is doubtless retarded in its velocity, just in the exact proportion in which the body shares in its motion; but it never loses the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which properly belongs to it. For the body may be compared to an instrument; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is possessed of the reason of an artist. As, therefore, the artist finds the idea of a work to spring up rapidly in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but can only carry it out slowly by means of an instrument, owing to the want of perfect pliability in the matter acted upon, and thus the rapidity of his mental operation, being blended with the slow action of the instrument, gives rise to a moderate kind of movement [towards the end contemplated]; so also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by being mixed up with the body belonging to it, is in a certain measure impeded, its rapidity being blended with the body's slowness. Yet it does not lose altogether its own peculiar powers; but while, as it were, sharing life with the body, it does not itself cease to live. Thus, too, while communicating other things to the body, it neither loses the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them, nor the memory of those things which have been witnessed.</p>

<p>5. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remembers nothing  of what took place in a former state of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but has a perception of those things which are here, it follows that she never <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in other bodies, nor did things of which she has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, nor [once] <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> things which she cannot [now mentally] contemplate. But, as each one of us receives his body through the skilful  working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so does he also possess his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For God is not so poor or destitute in resources, that He cannot confer its own proper <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on each individual body, even as He gives it also its special character. And therefore, when the number [fixed upon] is completed, [that number] which He had predetermined in His own counsel, all those who have been enrolled for life [<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>] shall rise again, having their own bodies, and having also their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and their own spirits, in which they had pleased God. Those, on the other hand, who are worthy of punishment, shall go away into it, they too having their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and their own bodies, in which they stood apart from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Both classes shall then cease from any longer begetting and being begotten, from marrying and being given in marriage; so that the number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, corresponding to the fore-ordination of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being completed, may fully realize the scheme formed by the Father. </p>
