<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Chapter 9)</h1>

<span class="h1a">There is but one Creator of the world, God the Father: this the constant belief of the Church.</span>

<p>1. That God is the Creator of the world is accepted even by those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who in many ways speak against Him, and yet acknowledge Him, styling Him the Creator, and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, not to mention that all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> call out [to the same effect], and the Lord teaches us of this Father  who is in heaven, and no other, as I shall show in the sequel of this work. For the present, however, that <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> which is derived from those who allege doctrines opposite to ours, is of itself sufficient&mdash;all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in fact, consenting to this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: the ancients on their part preserving with special care, from the tradition of the first-formed man, this persuasion, while they celebrate the praises of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Maker of heaven and earth; others, again, after them, being reminded of this fact by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the very <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> learned it from creation itself. For even creation reveals Him who formed it, and the very work made suggests Him who made it, and the world manifests Him who ordered it. The Universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, moreover, through the whole world, has received this tradition from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>2. This <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, being acknowledged, as I have said, and receiving testimony from all to the fact of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, that Father whom they conjure into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> untenable, and has no witnesses [to his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>]. <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> was the first who said that he himself was God over all, and that the world was formed by his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Then those who succeeded him, as I have shown in the first book,  by their several opinions, still further depraved [his teaching] through their impious and irreligious doctrines against the Creator. These [<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> now referred to],  being the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of those mentioned, render such as assent to them worse than the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. For the former <q>serve the creature rather than the Creator,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013030"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;1:25</a></span> and <q>those which are not gods,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013031"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;4:8</a></span> notwithstanding that they ascribe the first place in Deity to that God who was the Maker of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. But the latter maintain that He, [i.e., the Creator of this world,] is the fruit of a defect, and describe Him as being of an animal nature, and as not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that Power which is above Him, while He also exclaims, <q>I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and besides Me there is no other God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013032"><a href="../bible/isa046.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;46:9</a></span> Affirming that He lies, they are themselves liars, attributing all sorts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to Him; and conceiving of one who is not above this Being as really having an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, they are thus convicted by their own views of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against that God who really exists, while they conjure into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> a god who has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, to their own condemnation. And thus those who declare themselves <q>perfect,</q> and as being possessed of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things, are found to be worse than the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and to entertain more <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> opinions even against their own Creator.</p>
