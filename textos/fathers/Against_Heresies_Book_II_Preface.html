<h1>Against Heresies (Book II, Preface)</h1>

<p>1. In the first book, which immediately precedes this, exposing <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012986"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> I showed you, my very dear friend, that the whole system devised, in many and opposite ways, by those who are of the school of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, was false and baseless. I also set forth the tenets of their predecessors, proving that they not only differed among themselves, but had long previously swerved from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. I further explained, with all diligence, the doctrine as well as practice of Marcus the magician, since he, too, belongs to these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and I carefully noticed  the passages which they garble from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, with the view of adapting them to their own fictions. Moreover, I minutely narrated the manner in which, by means of numbers, and by the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, they boldly endeavour to establish [what they regard as] <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I have also related how they think and teach that creation at large was formed after the image of their invisible Pleroma, and what they hold respecting the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, declaring at the same time the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, their progenitor, and of all those who succeeded him. I mentioned, too, the multitude of those <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> who are sprung from him, and noticed  the points of difference between them, their several doctrines, and the order of their succession, while I set forth all those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which have been originated by them. I showed, moreover, that all these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, taking their rise from Simon, have introduced impious and irreligious doctrines into this life; and I explained the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their <q>redemption,</q> and their method of initiating those who are rendered <q>perfect,</q> along with their invocations and their <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. I <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> also that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, the Creator, and that He is not the fruit of any defect, nor is there anything either above Him, or after Him.2. In the present book, I shall establish those points which fit in with my design, so far as time permits, and overthrow, by means of lengthened treatment under distinct heads, their whole system; for which reason, since it is an exposure and subversion of their opinions, I have so entitled the composition of this work. For it is fitting, by a plain revelation and overthrow of their conjunctions, to put an end to these hidden alliances,  and to Bythus himself, and thus to obtain a demonstration that he never <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> at any previous time, nor now has any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</p>
