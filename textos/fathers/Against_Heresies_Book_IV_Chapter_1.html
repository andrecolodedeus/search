<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 1)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The Lord acknowledged but one God and Father.</span>

<p>1. Since, therefore, this is sure and steadfast, that no other God or Lord was announced by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, except Him who, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rules over all, together with His Word, and those who receive the Spirit of adoption,  that is, those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the one and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and likewise that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did of themselves term no one else as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or name [no other] as Lord; and, what is much more important, [since it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>] that our Lord [acted likewise], who did also command us to confess no one as Father, except Him who is in the heavens, who is the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> and the one Father;&mdash; those things are clearly shown to be false which these deceivers and most perverse sophists advance, maintaining that the being whom they have themselves invented is by nature both God and Father; but that the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> is naturally neither God nor Father, but is so termed merely by courtesy (<em>verbo tenus</em>), because of his ruling the creation, these perverse mythologists state, setting their thoughts against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and, putting aside the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of themselves divining falsehoods, they dispute against the entire dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they maintain that their <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, and gods, and fathers, and lords, are also still further termed heavens, together with their Mother, whom they do also call <q>the Earth,</q> and <q>Jerusalem,</q> while they also style her many other names.</p>

<p>2. Now to whom is it not clear, that if the Lord had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> many fathers and gods, He would not have taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> [only] one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note013806"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> and to call Him alone Father? But He did the rather distinguish those who by word merely (<em>verbo tenus</em>) are termed gods, from Him who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they should not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> as to His doctrine, nor understand one [in mistake] for another. And if He did indeed teach us to call one Being Father and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while He does from time to time Himself confess other fathers and gods in the same sense, then He will appear to enjoin a different course upon His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> from what He follows Himself. Such conduct, however, does not bespeak the good teacher, but a misleading and invidious one. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, too, according to these men's showing, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be transgressors of the commandment, since they confess the Creator as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Lord, and Father, as I have shown&mdash; if He is not alone God and Father. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, therefore, will be to them the author and teacher of such transgression, inasmuch as He commanded that one Being should be called Father, <span class="stiki" id="note013807"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;23:9</a></span> thus imposing upon them the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confessing the Creator as their Father, as has been pointed out.</p>
