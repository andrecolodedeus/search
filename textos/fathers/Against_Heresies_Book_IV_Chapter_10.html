<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 10)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The Old Testament Scriptures, and those written by Moses in particular, do everywhere make mention of the Son of God, and foretell His advent and passion. From this fact it follows that they were inspired by one and the same God.</span>

<p>1. Wherefore also John does appropriately relate that the Lord said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>You search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, in which you think you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; these are they which testify of me. And you are not willing to come unto Me, that you may have life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013916"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;5:39-40</a></span> How therefore did the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> testify of Him, unless they were from one and the same Father, instructing men beforehand as to the advent of His Son, and foretelling the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> brought in by Him? <q>For if you had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would also have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Me; for he wrote of Me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013917"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;5:46</a></span> [saying this,] no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is implanted everywhere throughout his writings: at one time, indeed, speaking with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when about to eat with him; at another time with <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, giving to him the dimensions [of the ark]; at another; inquiring after Adam; at another, bringing down judgment upon the Sodomites; and again, when He becomes visible,  and directs Jacob on his journey, and speaks with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from the bush. <span class="stiki" id="note013919"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse4">Exodus&nbsp;3:4</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And it would be endless to recount [the occasions] upon which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is shown forth by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Of the day of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, too, he was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; but foretold Him, after a figurative manner, by the name given to the passover;  and at that very festival, which had been proclaimed such a long time previously by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, did our Lord suffer, thus fulfilling the passover. And he did not describe the day only, but the place also, and the time of day at which the sufferings ceased,  and the sign of the setting of the sun, saying: <q>You may not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the passover within any other of your cities which the Lord God gives you; but in the place which the Lord your God shall choose that His name be called on there, you shall <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the passover at even, towards the setting of the sun.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013922"><a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;16:5-6</a></span> </p>

<p>2. And already he had also declared His advent, saying, <q>There shall not fail a chief in Judah, nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is laid up, and He is the hope of the nations; binding His foal to the vine, and His ass's colt to the creeping ivy. He shall wash His stole in wine, and His upper garment  in the blood of the grape; His eyes shall be more joyous than wine,  and His teeth whiter than milk.</q>  For, let those who have the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of investigating everything, inquire at what time a prince and leader failed out of Judah, and who is the hope of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, who also is the vine, what was the ass's colt [referred to as] His, what the clothing, and what the eyes, what the teeth, and what the wine, and thus let them investigate every one of the points mentioned; and they shall find that there was none other announced than our Lord, Christ Jesus. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when chiding the ingratitude of the people, said, <q>You infatuated people, and unwise, do you thus requite the Lord?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013925"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:6</a></span> And again, he indicates that He who from the beginning founded and created them, the Word, who also redeems and vivifies us in the last times, is shown as hanging on the tree, and they will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. For he says, <q>And your life shall be hanging before your eyes, and you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> your life.</q>  And again, <q>Has not this same one your Father owned you, and made you, and created you?</q> </p>
