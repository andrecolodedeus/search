<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 11)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The old prophets and righteous men knew beforehand of the advent of Christ, and earnestly desired to see and hear Him, He revealing himself in the Scriptures by the Holy Ghost, and without any change in Himself, enriching men day by day with benefits, but conferring them in greater abundance on later than on former generations.</span>

<p>1. But that it was not only the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and many righteous men, who, foreseeing through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> His advent, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that they might attain to that period in which they should see their Lord face to face, and hear His words, the Lord has made manifest, when He says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013928"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;13:17</a></span> In what way, then, did they desire both to hear and to see, unless they had foreknowledge of His future advent? But how could they have foreknown it, unless they had previously received foreknowledge from Himself? And how do the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> testify of Him, unless all things had ever been revealed and shown to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> by one and the same God through the Word; He at one time conferring with His creature, and at another propounding His law; at one time, again, reproving, at another exhorting, and then setting free His servant, and adopting him as a son (<em>in filium</em>); and, at the proper time, bestowing an incorruptible inheritance, for the purpose of bringing man to perfection? For He formed him for growth and increase, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q>Increase and multiply.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013929"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> </p>

<p>2. And in this respect God differs from man, that God indeed makes, but man is made; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, He who makes is always the same; but that which is made must receive both beginning, and middle, and addition, and increase. And God does indeed create after a skilful manner, while, [as regards] man, he <em>is</em> created skilfully. God also is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> perfect in all things, Himself equal and similar to Himself, as He is all light, and all <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and all substance, and the fount of all good; but man receives advancement and increase towards God. For as God is always the same, so also man, when found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall always go on towards God. For neither does God at any time cease to confer benefits upon, or to enrich man; nor does man ever cease from receiving the benefits, and being enriched by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the receptacle of His goodness, and the instrument of His glorification, is the man who is grateful to Him that made him; and again, the receptacle of His just judgment is the ungrateful man, who both despises his Maker and is not subject to His Word; who has promised that He will give very much to those always bringing forth fruit, and more [and more] to those who have the Lord's money. <q>Well done,</q> He says, <q>good and faithful servant: because you have been faithful in little, I will appoint you over many things; enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013930"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;25:21</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> The Lord Himself thus promises very much.</p>

<p>3. As, therefore, He has promised to give very much to those who do now bring forth fruit, according to the gift of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but not according to the changeableness of <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;</q> for the Lord remains the same, and the same Father is revealed; thus, therefore, has the one and the same Lord granted, by means of His advent, a greater gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to those of a later period, than what He had granted to those under the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> dispensation. For they indeed used to hear, by means of [His] servants, that the King would come, and they rejoiced to a certain extent, inasmuch as they hoped for His coming; but those who have beheld Him actually present, and have obtained liberty, and been made partakers of His gifts, do possess a greater amount of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and a higher degree of exultation, rejoicing because of the King's arrival: as  also David says, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord; it shall be glad in His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q>  And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, upon His entrance into Jerusalem, all those who were in the way  recognised David their king in His sorrow of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and spread their garments for Him, and ornamented the way with green boughs, crying out with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the Son of David; blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: hosanna in the highest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013933"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;21:8</a></span> But to the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> stewards, who circumvented those under them, and ruled over those that had no great intelligence,  and for this reason were unwilling that the king should come, and who said to Him, <q>Do you hear what these say?</q> did the Lord reply, <q>Have you never read, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings have You perfected praise?</q> &mdash; thus pointing out that what had been declared by David concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, was accomplished in His own person; and indicating that they were indeed <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the meaning of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> and the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but declaring that it was Himself who was announced by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as Christ, whose name is praised in all the earth, and who perfects praise to His Father from the mouth of babes and sucklings; wherefore also His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> has been raised above the heavens.</p>

<p>4. If, therefore, the self-same person is present who was announced by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and if His advent has brought in a fuller [measure of] <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and greater gifts to those who have received Him, it is plain that the Father also is Himself the same who was proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, on His coming, did not spread the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another Father, but of the same who was preached from the beginning; from whom also He has brought down liberty to those who, in a lawful manner, and with a willing <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with all the heart, do Him service; whereas to scoffers, and to those not subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but who follow outward purifications for the praise of men (which observances had been given as a type of future things&mdash;the law typifying, as it were, certain things in a shadow, and delineating <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things by temporal, celestial by terrestrial), and to those who pretend that they do themselves observe more than what has been prescribed, as if preferring their own <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to God Himself, while within they are full of hypocrisy, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>&mdash;[to such] has He assigned everlasting perdition by cutting them off from life.</p>
