<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 12)</h1>

<span class="h1a">It clearly appears that there was but one author of both the old and the new law, from the fact that Christ condemned traditions and customs repugnant to the former, while He confirmed its most important precepts, and taught that He was Himself the end of the Mosaic law.</span>

<p>1. For the tradition of the elders themselves, which they pretended to observe from the law, was contrary to the law given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Wherefore also Esaias declares: <q>Your dealers mix the wine with water,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013936"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse22">Isaiah&nbsp;1:22</a></span> showing that the elders were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of mingling a watered tradition with the simple command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that is, they set up a spurious law, and one contrary to the [<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>] law; as also the Lord made plain, when He said to them, <q>Why do you transgress the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the sake of your tradition?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013937"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;15:3</a></span> For not only by actual transgression did they set the law of God at nought, mingling the wine with water; but they also set up their own law in opposition to it, which is termed, even to the present day, the pharisaical. In this [law] they suppress certain things, add others, and interpret others, again, as they think proper, which their teachers use, each one in particular; and desiring to uphold these traditions, they were unwilling to be subject to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which prepares them for the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But they did even blame the Lord for healing on the Sabbath-days, which, as I have already observed, the law did not prohibit. For they did themselves, in one sense, perform acts of healing upon the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, when they <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> a man [on that day]; but they did not blame themselves for transgressing the command of God through tradition and the aforesaid pharisaical law, and for not keeping the commandment of the law, which is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. But that this is the first and greatest commandment, and that the next [has respect to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>] towards our neighbour, the Lord has taught, when He says that the entire law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> hang upon these two commandments. Moreover, He did not Himself bring down [from heaven] any other commandment greater than this one, but renewed this very same one to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when He enjoined them to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God with all their heart, and others as themselves. But if He had descended from another Father, He never would have made use of the first and greatest commandment of the law; but He would undoubtedly have endeavoured by all means to bring down a greater one than this from the perfect Father, so as not to make use of that which had been given by the  God of the law. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in like manner declares, <q>Love is the fulfilling of the law:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013938"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> and [he declares] that when all other things have been destroyed, there shall remain <q><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but the greatest of all is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013939"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:13</a></span> and that apart from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> avails anything, <span class="stiki" id="note013940"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:2</a></span> nor the understanding of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, but that without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all are hollow and vain; moreover, that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> makes man perfect; and that he who loves God is perfect, both in this world and in that which is to come. For we do never cease from loving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but in proportion as we continue to contemplate Him, so much the more do we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him.</p>

<p>3. As in the law, therefore, and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> [likewise], the first and greatest commandment is, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord God with the whole heart, and then there follows a commandment like to it, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one's neighbour as one's self; the author of the law and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is shown to be one and the same. For the precepts of an absolutely perfect life, since they are the same in each Testament, have pointed out [to us] the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who certainly has promulgated particular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> adapted for each; but the more prominent and the greatest [commandments], without which <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> cannot [be attained], He has exhorted [us to observe] the same in both.</p>

<p>4. The Lord, too, does not do away with this [God], when He shows that the law was not derived from another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, expressing Himself as follows to those who were being instructed by Him, to the multitude and to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>The <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> sit in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> seat. All, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not after their works: for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy burdens, and lay them upon men's shoulders; but they themselves will not so much as move them with a finger.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013941"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;23:2-4</a></span> He therefore did not throw blame upon that law which was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when He exhorted it to be observed, Jerusalem being as yet in safety; but He <em>did</em> throw blame upon those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because they repeated indeed the words of the law, yet were without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And for this reason were they held as being unrighteous as respects <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as respects their neighbours. As also Isaiah says: <q>This people honours Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me: howbeit in vain do they worship Me, teaching the doctrines and the commandments of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013942"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> He does not call the law given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commandments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but the traditions of the elders themselves which they had invented, and in upholding which they made the law of God of none effect, and were on this account also not subject to His Word. For this is what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says concerning these men: <q>For they, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013943"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3-4</a></span> And how is Christ the end of the law, if He be not also the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of it? For He who has brought in the end has Himself also wrought the beginning; and it is He who does Himself say to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>I have surely seen the affliction of my people which is in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and I have come down to deliver them;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013944"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;3:7-8</a></span> it being customary from the beginning with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> to ascend and descend for the purpose of saving those who were in affliction.</p>

<p>5. Now, that the law did beforehand teach <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of following Christ, He does Himself make manifest, when He replied as follows to him who asked Him what he should do that he might inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life: <q>If you will enter into life, keep the commandments.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013945"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;19:17-18</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> But upon the other asking <q>Which?</q> again the Lord replies: <q>Do not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> father and mother, and you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself,</q>&mdash; setting as an ascending series (<em>velut gradus</em>) before those who wished to follow Him, the precepts of the law, as the entrance into life; and what He then said to one He said to all. But when the former said, <q>All these have I done</q> (and most likely he had not kept them, for in that case the Lord would not have said to him, <q>Keep the commandments</q>), the Lord, exposing his <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, said to him, <q>If you will be perfect, go, sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor; and come, follow me;</q> promising to those who would act thus, the portion belonging to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (<em>apostolorum partem</em>). And He did not preach to His followers another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, besides Him who was proclaimed by the law from the beginning; nor another Son; nor the Mother, the enthymesis of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in suffering and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>; nor the Pleroma of the thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, which has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> vain, and incapable of being <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in; nor that fable invented by the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But He taught that they should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commandments which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enjoined from the beginning, and do away with their former <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> by good works,  and follow after Christ. But that  possessions distributed to the poor do annul former <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, Zaccheus made evident, when he said, <q>Behold, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one, I restore fourfold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013947"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;19:8</a></span> </p>
