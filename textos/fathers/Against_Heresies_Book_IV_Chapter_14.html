<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 14)</h1>

<span class="h1a">If God demands obedience from man, if He formed man, called him and placed him under laws, it was merely for man's welfare; not that God stood in need of man, but that He graciously conferred upon man His favours in every possible manner.</span>

<p>1. In the beginning, therefore, did God form Adam, not as if He stood in need of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but that He might have [some one] upon whom to confer His benefits. For not alone antecedently to Adam, but also before all creation, the Word <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> His Father, remaining in Him; and was Himself <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as He did Himself declare, <q>Father, glorify Me with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You before the world was.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013960"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;17:5</a></span> Nor did He stand in need of our service when He ordered us to follow Him; but He thus bestowed <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> upon ourselves. For to follow the Saviour is to be a partaker of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and to follow light is to receive light. But those who are in light do not themselves illumine the light, but are illumined and revealed by it: they do certainly contribute nothing to it, but, receiving the benefit, they are illumined by the light. Thus, also, service [rendered] to God does indeed profit God nothing, nor has God need of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; but He grants to those who follow and serve Him life and incorruption and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, bestowing benefit upon those who serve [Him], because they do serve Him, and on His followers, because they do follow Him; but does not receive any benefit from them: for He is rich, perfect, and in need of nothing. But for this reason does God demand service from men, in order that, since He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and merciful, He may benefit those who continue in His service. For, as much as God is in want of nothing, so much does man stand in need of fellowship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to continue and remain permanently in God's service. Wherefore also did the Lord say to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013961"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;15:16</a></span> indicating that they did not glorify Him when they followed Him; but that, in following the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, they were <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by Him. And again, <q>I will, that where I am, there they also may be, that they may behold My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013962"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;17:24</a></span> not vainly boasting because of this, but desiring that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should share in His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: of whom Esaias also says, <q>I will bring your seed from the east, and will gather you from the  west; and I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the ends of the earth; all, as many as have been called in My name: for in My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> I have prepared, and formed, and made him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013963"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;43:5</a></span> Inasmuch as then, <q>wheresoever the carcass is, there shall also the eagles be gathered together,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013964"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;24:28</a></span> we do participate in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, who has both formed us, and prepared us for this, that, when we are with Him, we may partake of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p>2. Thus it was, too, that God formed man at the first, because of His munificence; but chose the patriarchs for the sake of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and prepared a people beforehand, teaching the headstrong to follow <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and raised up <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> upon earth, accustoming man to bear His Spirit [within him], and to hold communion with God: He Himself, indeed, having need of nothing, but granting communion with Himself to those who stood in need of it, and sketching out, like an architect, the plan of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to those that pleased Him. And He did Himself furnish guidance to those who beheld Him not in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, while to those who became unruly in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> He promulgated a law very suitable [to their condition]. Then, on the people who entered into the good land He bestowed a noble inheritance; and He killed the fatted calf for those converted to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and presented them with the finest robe. <span class="stiki" id="note013965"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;15:22-23</a></span> Thus, in a variety of ways, He adjusted the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> to an agreement with <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. On this account also does John declare in the Apocalypse, <q>And His voice as the sound of many waters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013966"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse15">Revelation&nbsp;1:15</a></span> For the Spirit [of God] is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> [like] many waters, since the Father is both rich and great. And the Word, passing through all those [men], did liberally confer benefits upon His subjects, by drawing up in writing a law adapted and applicable to every class [among them].</p>

<p>3. Thus, too, He imposed upon the [Jewish] people the construction of the tabernacle, the building of the temple, the election of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> also, and oblations, legal monitions, and all the other service of the law. He does Himself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> want none of these things, for He is always full of all good, and had in Himself all the odour of kindness, and every perfume of sweet-smelling savours, even before <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. Moreover, He instructed the people, who were prone to turn to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, instructing them by repeated appeals to persevere and to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, calling them to the things of primary importance by means of those which were secondary; that is, to things that are real, by means of those that are typical; and by things temporal, to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and by the carnal to the spiritual; and by the earthly to the heavenly; as was also said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>You shall make all things after the pattern of those things which you saw in the mount.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013967"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse40">Exodus&nbsp;25:40</a></span> For during forty days He was learning to keep [in his memory] the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the celestial patterns, and the spiritual images, and the types of things to come; as also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>For they drank of the rock which followed them: and the rock was Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013968"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:11</a></span> And again, having first mentioned what are contained in the law, he goes on to say: <q>Now all these things happened to them in a figure; but they were written for our admonition, upon whom the end of the ages has come.</q> For by means of types they learned to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to continue devoted to His service.</p>
