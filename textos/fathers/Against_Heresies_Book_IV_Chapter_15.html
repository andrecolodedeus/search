<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 15)</h1>

<span class="h1a">At first God deemed it sufficient to inscribe the natural law, or the Decalogue, upon the hearts of men; but afterwards He found it necessary to bridle, with the yoke of the Mosaic law, the desires of the Jews, who were abusing their liberty; and even to add some special commands, because of the hardness of their hearts.</span>

<p>1. They (the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>) had therefore a law, a course of discipline, and a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of future things. For God at the first, indeed, warning them by means of natural precepts, which from the beginning He had implanted in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, that is, by means of the Decalogue (which, if any one does not observe, he has no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>), did then demand nothing more of them. As <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says in Deuteronomy, <q>These are all the words which the Lord spoke to the whole assembly of the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> on the mount, and He added no more; and He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013969"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse22">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:22</a></span> For this reason [He did so], that they who are willing to follow Him might keep these commandments. But when they turned themselves to make a calf, and had gone back in their minds to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, desiring to be slaves instead of free-men, they were placed for the future in a state of servitude suited to their wish&mdash;[a slavery] which did not indeed cut them off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but subjected them to the yoke of bondage; as Ezekiel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, when stating the reasons for the giving of such a law, declares: <q>And their eyes were after the desire of their heart; and I gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments in which they shall not live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013970"><a href="../bible/eze020.htm#verse24">Ezekiel&nbsp;20:24</a></span>  Luke also has recorded that Stephen, who was the first elected into the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  and who was the first slain for the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, spoke regarding <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as follows: <q>This man did indeed receive the commandments of the living God to give to us, whom your fathers would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, but thrust [Him from them], and in their hearts turned back again into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, saying unto <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, Make us gods to go before us; for we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what has happened to [this] <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who led us from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And they made a calf in those days, and offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands. But God turned, and gave them up to worship the hosts of heaven; as it is written in the book of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note013972"><a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse25">Amos&nbsp;5:25-26</a></span> O you house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, have you offered to Me <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and oblations for forty years in the wilderness? And you took up the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a>, and the star of the god Remphan,  figures which you made to worship them;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013974"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;7:38</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> pointing out plainly, that the law being such, was not given to them by another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that, adapted to their condition of servitude, [it originated] from the very same [God as we worship]. Wherefore also He says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in Exodus: <q>I will send forth My <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before you; for I will not go up with you, because you are a stiff-necked people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013975"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;33:2-3</a></span> </p>

<p>2. And not only so, but the Lord also showed that certain precepts were enacted for them by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, on account of their hardness [of heart], and because of their unwillingness to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, when, on their saying to Him, <q>Why then did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> command to give a writing of divorcement, and to send away a wife?</q> He said to them, <q>Because of the hardness of your hearts he permitted these things to you; but from the beginning it was not so;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013976"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;19:7-8</a></span> thus exculpating <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as a faithful servant, but acknowledging one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who from the beginning made male and female, and reproving them as hard-hearted and disobedient. And therefore it was that they received from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> this law of divorcement, adapted to their hard nature. But why say I these things concerning the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>? For in the New also are the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> found doing this very thing, on the ground which has been mentioned, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> plainly declaring, <q>But these things I say, not the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013977"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:12</a></span> And again: <q>But this I speak by permission, not by commandment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013978"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:6</a></span> And again: <q>Now, as concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013979"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> But further, in another place he says: <q>That <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> tempt you not for your incontinence.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013980"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5</a></span> If, therefore, even in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are found granting certain precepts in consideration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, because of the incontinence of some, lest such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, having grown obdurate, and despairing altogether of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, should become <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;it ought not to be wondered at, if also in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the same God permitted similar indulgences for the benefit of His people, drawing them on by means of the ordinances already mentioned, so that they might obtain the gift of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through them, while they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the Decalogue, and being restrained by Him, should not revert to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but learn to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him with the whole heart. And if certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, because of the disobedient and ruined <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, do assert that the giver (<em>doctor</em>) of the law was limited in power, they will find in our dispensation, that <q>many are called, but few chosen;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013981"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;20:16</a></span> and that there are those who inwardly are wolves, yet wear sheep's clothing in the eyes of the world (<em>foris</em>); and that God has always preserved freedom, and the power of self-government in man,  while at the same time He issued His own exhortations, in order that those who do not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him should be righteously judged (condemned) because they have not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> Him; and that those who have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him should be honoured with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</p>
