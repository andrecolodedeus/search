<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 16)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Perfect righteousness was conferred neither by circumcision nor by any other legal ceremonies. The Decalogue, however, was not cancelled by Christ, but is always in force: men were never released from its commandments.</span>

<p>1. Moreover, we learn from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> itself, that God gave <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, not as the completer of righteousness, but as a sign, that the race of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> might continue recognisable. For it declares: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Every male among you shall be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>; and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins, as a token of the covenant between Me and you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013983"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;17:9-11</a></span> This same does Ezekiel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> say with regard to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>: <q>Also I gave them My <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord, that sanctify them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013984"><a href="../bible/eze020.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;20:12</a></span> And in Exodus, God says to  <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>And you shall observe My <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>; for it shall be a sign between Me and you for your generations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013985"><a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;21:13</a></span> These things, then, were given for a sign; but the signs were not unsymbolical, that is, neither unmeaning nor to no purpose, inasmuch as they were given by a wise Artist; but the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> after the flesh typified that after the Spirit. For <q>we,</q> says the apostle, <q>have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> made without hands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013986"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declares, <q>Circumcise the hardness of your heart.</q>  But the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> taught that we should continue day by day in God's service.  <q>For we have been counted,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, <q>all the day long as sheep for the slaughter;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013989"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse36">Romans&nbsp;8:36</a></span> that is, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> [to God], and ministering continually to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and persevering in it, and abstaining from all <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and not acquiring or possessing treasures upon earth. <span class="stiki" id="note013990"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;6:19</a></span> Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> of God (<em>requietio Dei</em>), that is, the kingdom, was, as it were, indicated by <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things; in which [kingdom], the man who shall have persevered in serving God (<em>Deo assistere</em>) shall, in a state of rest, partake of God's table.</p>

<p>2. And that man was not justified by these things, but that they were given as a sign to the people, this fact shows&mdash;that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself, without <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and without observance of <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013991"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse23">James&nbsp;2:23</a></span> Then, again, <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, without <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, was brought out from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, receiving <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So also did <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although he was uncircumcised, receive the dimensions [of the ark], of the world of the second race [of men]. <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, too, pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, discharged the office of God's legate to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> although he was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and was translated, and is preserved until now as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> when they had transgressed fell to the earth for judgment, but the man who pleased [God] was translated for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  Moreover, all the rest of the multitude of those righteous men who lived before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of those patriarchs who preceded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, were justified independently of the things above mentioned, and without the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>. As also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself says to the people in Deuteronomy: <q>The Lord your God formed a covenant in Horeb. The Lord formed not this covenant with your fathers, but for you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013993"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:2</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Why, then, did the Lord not form the covenant for the fathers? Because <q>the law was not established for righteous men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013994"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:9</a></span> But the righteous fathers had the meaning of the Decalogue written in their hearts and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>,  that is, they loved the God who made them, and did no injury to their neighbour. There was therefore no occasion that they should be cautioned by prohibitory mandates (<em>correptoriis literis</em>),  because they had the righteousness of the law in themselves. But when this righteousness and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to God had passed into oblivion, and became extinct in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, God did necessarily, because of His great goodwill to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, reveal Himself by a voice, and led the people with power out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in order that man might again become the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and follower of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and He afflicted those who were disobedient, that they should not contemn their Creator; and He fed them with manna, that they might receive food for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (<em>uti rationalem acciperent escam</em>); as also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says in Deuteronomy: <q>And fed you with manna, which your fathers did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that man does not live by bread alone; but by every word of God proceeding out of His mouth does man live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013997"><a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy&nbsp;8:3</a></span> And it enjoined <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and taught just dealing towards our neighbour, that we should neither be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> nor unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who prepares man for His friendship through the medium of the Decalogue, and likewise for agreement with his neighbour&mdash;matters which did certainly profit man himself; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, standing in no need of anything from man.</p>

<p>4. And therefore does the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> say, <q>These words the Lord spoke to all the assembly of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the mount, and He added no more;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013998"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse22">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:22</a></span> for, as I have already observed, He stood in need of nothing from them. And again <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says: <q>And now <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to walk in all His ways, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013999"><a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;10:12</a></span> Now these things did indeed make man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, by supplying what was wanting to him, namely, the friendship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but they profited God nothing, for God did not at all  stand in need of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God was wanting to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which he could obtain in no other way than by serving God. And therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says to them again: <q>Choose life, that you may live, and your seed, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to hear His voice, to cleave unto Him; for this is your life, and the length of your days.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014000"><a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy&nbsp;30:19-20</a></span> Preparing man for this life, the Lord Himself did speak in His own person to all alike the words of the Decalogue; and therefore, in like manner, do they remain permanently with us,  receiving by means of His advent in the flesh, extension and increase, but not abrogation.</p>

<p>5. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of bondage, however, were one by one promulgated to the people by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, suited for their instruction or for their punishment, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself declared: <q>And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014002"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:14</a></span> These things, therefore, which were given for bondage, and for a sign to them, He cancelled by the new covenant of liberty. But He has increased and widened those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which are natural, and noble, and common to all, granting to men largely and without grudging, by means of adoption, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him with the whole heart, and to follow His word unswervingly, while they abstain not only from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, but even from the desire after them. But He has also increased the feeling of reverence; for sons should have more veneration than slaves, and greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for their father. And therefore the Lord says, <q>As to every idle word that men have spoken, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014003"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a></span> And, <q>he who has looked upon a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her, has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her already in his heart;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014004"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> and, <q>he that is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, shall be in danger of the judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014005"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> [All this is declared,] that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we shall give account to God not of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> only, as slaves, but even of words and thoughts, as those who have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> received the power of liberty, in which [condition] a man is more severely tested, whether he will reverence, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord. And for this reason Peter says <q>that we have not liberty as a cloak of maliciousness,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014006"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:16</a></span> but as the means of testing and evidencing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>
