<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 17)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Proof that God did not appoint the Levitical dispensation for His own sake, or as requiring such service; for He does, in fact, need nothing from men.</span>

<p>1. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> indicate in the fullest manner that God stood in no need of their slavish <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, but that it was upon their own account that He enjoined certain observances in the law. And again, that God needed not their oblation, but [merely demanded it], on account of man himself who offers it, the Lord taught distinctly, as I have pointed out. For when He perceived them neglecting righteousness, and abstaining from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and imagining that God was to be propitiated by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and the other typical observances, Samuel did even thus speak to them: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not desire whole burnt-offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but He will have His voice to be hearkened to. Behold, a ready <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is better than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014007"><a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;15:22</a></span> David also says: <q>Sacrifice and oblation You did not desire, but my ears have You perfected;  burnt-offerings also for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> You have not required.</q>  He thus teaches them that God desires <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, which renders them secure, rather than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, which avail them nothing towards righteousness; and [by this declaration] he prophesies the new covenant at the same time. Still clearer, too, does he speak of these things in the fiftieth Psalm: <q>For if You had desired <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, then would I have given it: You will not delight in burnt-offerings. The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart the Lord will not despise.</q>  Because, therefore, God stands in need of nothing, He declares in the preceding Psalm: <q>I will take no calves out of your house, nor he-goats out of your fold. For Mine are all the beasts of the earth, the herds and the oxen on the mountains: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the fowls of heaven, and the various tribes  of the field are Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you: for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</q>  Then, lest it might be supposed that He refused these things in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, He continues, giving him (man) counsel: <q>Offer unto God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High; and call upon Me in the day of your trouble, and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me;</q>  rejecting, indeed, those things by which sinners imagined they could propitiate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and showing that He does Himself stand in need of nothing; but He exhorts and advises them to those  things by which man is justified and draws near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This same declaration does Esaias make: <q>To what purpose is the multitude of your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto Me? Says the Lord. I am full.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014014"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;1:11</a></span> And when He had repudiated <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and oblations, as likewise the new moons, and the sabbaths, and the festivals, and all the rest of the services accompanying these, He continues, exhorting them to what pertained to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: <q>Wash you, make you clean, take away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from your hearts from before my eyes: cease from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>; and come, let us reason together, says the Lord.</q></p>

<p>2. For it was not because He was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as many venture to say, that He rejected their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; but out of compassion to their blindness, and with the view of suggesting to them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, by offering which they shall appease <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they may receive life from Him. As He elsewhere declares: <q>The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an afflicted heart: a sweet savour to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a heart glorifying Him who formed it.</q>  For if, when <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, He had repudiated these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of theirs, as if they were <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unworthy to obtain His compassion, He would not certainly have urged these same things upon them as those by which they might be saved. But inasmuch as God is merciful, He did not cut them off from good counsel. For after He had said by Jeremiah, <q>To what purpose did you bring Me <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> from Saba, and cinnamon from a far country? Your whole burnt-offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are not acceptable to Me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014016"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse20">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:20</a></span> He proceeds: <q>Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah. These things says the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, Make straight your ways and your doings, and I will establish you in this place. Put not your trust in <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> words, for they will not at all profit you, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, it is [here].</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014017"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse2">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:2-3</a></span> </p>

<p>3. And again, when He points out that it was not for this that He led them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that they might offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to Him, but that, forgetting the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of the Egyptians, they should be able to hear the voice of the Lord, which was to them <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, He declares by this same Jeremiah: <q>Thus says the Lord; Collect together your burnt-offerings with your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and eat flesh. For I spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, concerning burnt-offerings or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: but this word I commanded them, saying, Hear My voice, and I will be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you shall be My people; and walk in all My ways whatsoever I have commanded you, that it may be well with you. But they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> not, nor hearkened; but walked in the imaginations of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart, and went backwards, and not forwards.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014018"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse21">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:21</a></span> And again, when He declares by the same man, <q>But let him that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this, to understand and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord, who does exercise loving-kindness, and righteousness, and judgment in the earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014019"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse24">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:24</a></span> He adds, <q>For in these things I delight, says the Lord,</q> but not in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, nor in <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a>, nor in oblations. For the people did not receive these precepts as of primary importance (<em>principaliter</em>), but as secondary, and for the reason already alleged, as Isaiah again says: <q>You have not [brought to] Me the sheep of your holocaust, nor in your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> have you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Me: you have not served Me in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, nor in [the matter of] frankincense have you done anything laboriously; neither have you bought for Me <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> with money, nor have I desired the fat of your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; but you have stood before Me in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and in your iniquities.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014020"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse23">Isaiah&nbsp;43:23-24</a></span> He says, therefore, <q>Upon this man will I look, even upon him that is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and meek, and who trembles at My words.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014021"><a href="../bible/isa046.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;46:2</a></span> <q>For the fat and the fat flesh shall not take away from you your unrighteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014022"><a href="../bible/jer011.htm#verse15">Jeremiah&nbsp;11:15</a></span> <q>This is the fast which I have chosen, says the Lord. Loose every band of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, dissolve the connections of violent agreements, give rest to those that are shaken, and cancel every <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> document. Deal your bread to the hungry willingly, and lead into your house the roofless stranger. If you have seen the naked, cover him, and you shall not despise those of your own flesh and blood (<em>domesticos seminis tui</em>). Then shall your morning light break forth, and your health shall spring forth more speedily; and righteousness shall go before you, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord shall surround you: and while you are yet speaking, I will say, Behold, here I am.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014023"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;58:6</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And Zechariah also, among the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, pointing out to the people the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says: <q>These things does the Lord Omnipotent declare: Execute <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment, and show mercy and compassion each one to his brother. And oppress not the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and the orphan, and the <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a>, and the poor; and let none <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against your brother in his heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014024"><a href="../bible/zec007.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;7:9-10</a></span> And again, he says: <q>These are the words which you  shall utter. Speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> every man to his neighbour, and execute peaceful judgment in your gates, and let none of you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his heart against his brother, and you shall not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> false swearing: for all these things I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, says the Lord Almighty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014025"><a href="../bible/zec008.htm#verse16">Zechariah&nbsp;8:16-17</a></span> Moreover, David also says in like manner: <q>What man is there who desires life, and would fain see good days? Keep your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips that they speak no guile. Shun <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do good: seek peace, and pursue it.</q> </p>

<p>4. From all these it is evident that God did not seek <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> from them, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and righteousness, because of their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when teaching them His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in Hosea the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, said, <q>I desire mercy rather than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God more than burnt-offerings.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014027"><a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse6">Hosea&nbsp;6:6</a></span> Besides, our Lord also exhorted them to the same effect, when He said, <q>But if you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what [this] means, I will have mercy, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, you would not have condemned the guiltless.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014028"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;12:7</a></span> Thus does He bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that they preached the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but accuses these men (His hearers) of being foolish through their own fault.</p>

<p>5. Again, giving directions to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to offer to God the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>  of His own, <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things&mdash; not as if He stood in need of them, but that they might be themselves neither unfruitful nor ungrateful&mdash; He took that created thing, bread, and gave thanks, and said, <q>This is My body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014030"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;26:26</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And the cup likewise, which is part of that creation to which we belong, He confessed to be His blood, and taught the new oblation of the new covenant; which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> receiving from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, offers to God throughout all the world, to Him who gives us as the means of subsistence the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of His own gifts in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, concerning which Malachi, among the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, thus spoke beforehand: <q>I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord Omnipotent, and I will not accept <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, unto the going down [of the same], My name is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and in every place <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is offered to My name, and a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; for great is My name among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, says the Lord Omnipotent;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014031"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;1:10-11</a></span> &mdash; indicating in the plainest manner, by these words, that the former people [the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>] shall indeed cease to make offerings to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that in every place <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> shall be offered to Him, and that a pure one; and His name is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. </p>

<p>6. But what other name is there which is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> than that of our Lord, by whom the Father is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and man also? And because it is [the name] of His own Son, who was made man by Him, He calls it His own. Just as a king, if he himself paints a likeness of his son, is right in calling this likeness his own, for both these reasons, because it is [the likeness] of his son, and because it is his own production; so also does the Father confess the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which is throughout all the world <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to be His own, both because it is that of His Son, and because He who thus describes it gave Him for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men. Since, therefore, the name of the Son belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and since in the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> God the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> makes offerings through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, He says well on both these grounds, <q>And in every place <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is offered to My name, and a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q> Now John, in the Apocalypse, declares that the <q><a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a></q> is <q>the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q> </p>
