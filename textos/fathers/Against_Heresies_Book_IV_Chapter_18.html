<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 18)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Concerning sacrifices and oblations, and those who truly offer them.</span>

<p>1. The oblation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, therefore, which the Lord gave instructions to be offered throughout all the world, is accounted with God a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and is acceptable to Him; not that He stands in need of a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> from us, but that he who offers is himself <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in what he does offer, if his gift be accepted. For by the gift both <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and affection are shown forth towards the King; and the Lord, wishing us to offer it in all simplicity and innocence, did express Himself thus: <q>Therefore, when you offer your gift upon the altar, and shall remember that your brother has ought against you, leave your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then return and offer your gift.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014034"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;5:23-24</a></span> We are bound, therefore, to offer to God the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of His creation, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also says, <q>You shall not appear in the presence of the Lord your God empty;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014035"><a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy&nbsp;16:16</a></span> so that man, being accounted as grateful, by those things in which he has shown his gratitude, may receive that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which flows from Him. </p>

<p>2. And the class of oblations in general has not been set aside; for there were both oblations  there [among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>], and there are oblations here [among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>]. Sacrifices there were among the people; <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> there are, too, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: but the species alone has been changed, inasmuch as the offering is now made, not by slaves, but by freemen. For the Lord is [ever] one and the same; but the character of a servile oblation is peculiar [to itself], as is also that of freemen, in order that, by the very oblations, the indication of liberty may be set forth. For with Him there is nothing purposeless, nor without signification, nor without design. And for this reason they (the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>) had indeed the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of their goods <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Him, but those who have received liberty set aside all their possessions for the Lord's purposes, bestowing joyfully and freely not the less valuable portions of their property, since they have the hope of better things [hereafter]; as that poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> acted who cast all her living into the treasury of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>3. For at the beginning God had respect to the gifts of Abel, because he offered with single-mindedness and righteousness; but He had no respect unto the offering of Cain, because his heart was divided with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, which he cherished against his brother, as God says when reproving his hidden [thoughts], <q>Though you offer rightly, yet, if you do not divide rightly, have you not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? Be at rest;</q>  since God is not appeased by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. For if any one shall endeavour to offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> merely to outward appearance, unexceptionably, in due order, and according to appointment, while in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he does not assign to his neighbour that fellowship with him which is right and proper, nor is under the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;he who thus cherishes secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not deceive God by that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which is offered correctly as to outward appearance; nor will such an oblation profit him anything, but [only] the giving up of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which has been conceived within him, so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may not the more, by means of the <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> action, render him the destroyer of himself.  Wherefore did the Lord also declare: <q>Woe unto you, <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, hypocrites, for you are like whited sepulchres. For the sepulchre appears beautiful outside, but within it is full of dead men's bones, and all uncleanness; even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within you are full of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and hypocrisy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014040"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;23:27-28</a></span> For while they were thought to offer correctly so far as outward appearance went, they had in themselves jealousy like to Cain; therefore they slew the Just One, slighting the counsel of the Word, as did also Cain. For [God] said to him, <q>Be at rest;</q> but he did not assent. Now what else is it to <q>be at rest</q> than to forego purposed <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>? And saying similar things to these men, He declares: <q>You blind <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, cleanse that which is within the cup, that the outside may be clean also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014041"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;23:26</a></span> And they did not listen to Him. For Jeremiah says, <q>Behold, neither your eyes nor your heart are good; but [they are turned] to your <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and to shed innocent blood, and for <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and for man-slaying, that you may do it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014042"><a href="../bible/jer022.htm#verse17">Jeremiah&nbsp;22:17</a></span> And again Isaiah says, <q>You have taken counsel, but not of Me; and made covenants, [but] not by My Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014043"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;30:1</a></span> In order, therefore, that their inner wish and thought, being brought to light, may show that God is without blame, and works no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> &mdash; that God who reveals what is hidden [in the heart], but who works not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash; when Cain was by no means at rest, He says to him: <q>To you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014044"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;4:7</a></span> Thus did He in like manner speak to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: <q>You should have no power at all against Me, unless it were given you from above;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014045"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;19:11</a></span> God always giving up the righteous one [in this life to suffering], that he, having been tested by what he suffered and endured, may [at last] be accepted; but that the evild&oelig;r, being judged by the actions he has performed, may be rejected. Sacrifices, therefore, do not sanctify a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for God stands in no need of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; but it is the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the offerer that sanctifies the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> when it is pure, and thus moves God to accept [the offering] as from a friend. <q>But the sinner,</q> says He, <q>who kills a calf [in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>] to Me, is as if he slew a dog.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014046"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;66:3</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Inasmuch, then, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> offers with single-mindedness, her gift is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reckoned a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says to the Philippians, <q>I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things that were sent from you, the odour of a sweet smell, a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> acceptable, pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014047"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> For it behooves us to make an oblation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in all things to be found grateful to God our Maker, in a pure <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without hypocrisy, in well-grounded hope, in fervent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, offering the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. And the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone offers this pure oblation to the Creator, offering to Him, with giving of thanks, [the things taken] from His creation. But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do not offer thus: for their hands are full of blood; for they have not received the Word,  through whom it is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Nor, again, do any of the conventicles (<em>synagog&aelig;</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> [offer this]. For some, by maintaining that the Father is different from the Creator, do, when they offer to Him what belongs to this creation of ours, set Him forth as being <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> of another's property, and desirous of what is not His own. Those, again, who maintain that the things around us originated from <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and passion, do, while offering unto Him the fruits of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, passion, and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against their Father, rather subjecting Him to insult than giving Him thanks. But how can they be consistent with themselves, [when they say] that the bread over which thanks have been given is the body of their Lord,  and the cup His blood, if they do not call Himself the Son of the Creator of the world, that is, His Word, through whom the wood fructifies, and the fountains gush forth, and the earth gives <q>first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014050"><a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse28">Mark&nbsp;4:28</a></span> </p>

<p>5. Then, again, how can they say that the flesh, which is nourished with the body of the Lord and with His blood, goes to corruption, and does not partake of life? Let them, therefore, either alter their opinion, or cease from offering the things just mentioned.  But our opinion is in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> in turn establishes our opinion. For we offer to Him His own, announcing consistently the fellowship and union of the flesh and Spirit.  For as the bread, which is produced from the earth, when it receives the invocation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is no longer common bread,  but the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, consisting of two realities, earthly and heavenly; so also our bodies, when they receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, are no longer corruptible, having the hope of the resurrection to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</p>

<p>6. Now we make offering to Him, not as though He stood in need of it, but rendering thanks for His gift,  and thus sanctifying what has been created. For even as God does not need our possessions, so do we need to offer something to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as Solomon says: <q>He that has pity upon the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, lends unto the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014055"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;19:17</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who stands in need of nothing, takes our good works to Himself for this purpose, that He may grant us a recompense of His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, as our Lord says: <q>Come, you blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you. For I was an hungered, and you gave Me to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and you took Me in: naked, and you clothed Me; sick, and you visited Me; in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you came to Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014056"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> As, therefore, He does not stand in need of these [services], yet does desire that we should render them for our own benefit, lest we be unfruitful; so did the Word give to the people that very precept as to the making of oblations, although He stood in no need of them, that they might learn to serve God: thus is it, therefore, also His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that we, too, should offer a gift at the altar, frequently and without intermission. The altar, then, is in heaven  (for towards that place are our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and oblations directed); the temple likewise [is there], as John says in the Apocalypse, <q>And the temple of God was opened:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014058"><a href="../bible/rev011.htm#verse19">Revelation&nbsp;11:19</a></span> the tabernacle also: <q>For, behold,</q> He says, <q>the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which He will dwell with men.</q></p>
