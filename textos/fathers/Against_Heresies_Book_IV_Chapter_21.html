<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 21)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Abraham's faith was identical with ours; this faith was prefigured by the words and actions of the old patriarchs.</span>

<p>1. But that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was also prefigured in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and that he was the patriarch of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of it, the apostle has very fully taught, when he says in the Epistle to the Galatians: <q>He therefore that ministers to you the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and works <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> among you, [does he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Even as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. Know therefore, that they which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the same are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, foreseeing that God would justify the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, announced beforehand unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that in him all nations should be blessed. So then they which be of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be blessed with faithful <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014114"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse5">Galatians&nbsp;3:5-9</a>; <a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;12:3</a></span> For which [reasons the apostle] declared that this man was not only the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also the father of those who from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, because his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and ours are one and the same: for he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in things future, as if they were already accomplished, because of the promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in like manner do we also, because of the promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that inheritance [laid up for us] in the [future] kingdom.</p>

<p>2. The history of Isaac, too, is not without a  <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> character. For in the Epistle to the Romans, the apostle declares: <q>Moreover, when Rebecca had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac,</q> she received answer  from the Word, <q>that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calls, it was said unto her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people are in your body; and the one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014116"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;9:10-13</a>; <a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;25:23</a></span> From which it is evident, that not only [were there] prophecies of the patriarchs, but also that the children brought forth by Rebecca were a prediction of the two nations; and that the one should be indeed the greater, but the other the less; that the one also should be under bondage, but the other free; but [that both should be] of one and the same father. Our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one and the same, is also their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> hidden things, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things before they can come to pass; and for this reason has He said, <q>Jacob have I loved, but <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> have I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014117"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;9:13</a>; <a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;1:2</a></span> </p>

<p>3. If any one, again, will look into Jacob's actions, he shall find them not destitute of meaning, but full of import with regard to the dispensations. Thus, in the first place, at his birth, since he laid hold on his brother's heel, <span class="stiki" id="note014118"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;25:26</a></span> he was called Jacob, that is, <em>the supplanter</em>&mdash; one who holds, but is not held; binding the feet, but not being bound; striving and conquering; grasping in his hand his adversary's heel, that is, victory. For to this end was the Lord born, the type of whose birth he set forth beforehand, of whom also John says in the Apocalypse: <q>He went forth conquering, that He should conquer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014119"><a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse2">Revelation&nbsp;6:2</a></span> In the next place, [Jacob] received the rights of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, when his brother looked on them with contempt; even as also the younger nation received Him, Christ, the first-begotten, when the elder nation rejected Him, saying, <q>We have no king but C&aelig;sar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014120"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;19:15</a></span> But in Christ every blessing [is summed up], and therefore the latter people has snatched away the blessings of the former from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, just as Jacob took away the blessing of this <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>. For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> his brother suffered the plots and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of a brother, just as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffers this self-same thing from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. In a foreign country were the twelve tribes born, the race of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, inasmuch as Christ was also, in a strange country, to generate the twelve-pillared foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Various coloured sheep were allotted to this Jacob as his wages; and the wages of Christ are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, who from various and diverse nations come together into one cohort of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the Father promised Him, saying, <q>Ask of Me, and I will give You the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession.</q>  And as from the multitude of his sons the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the Lord [afterwards] arose, there was every necessity that Jacob should beget sons from the two sisters, even as Christ did from the two <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of one and the same Father; and in like manner also from the handmaids, indicating that Christ should raise up sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both from freemen and from slaves after the flesh, bestowing upon all, in the same manner, the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who vivifies us.  But he (Jacob) did all things for the sake of the younger, she who had the handsome eyes,  Rachel, who prefigured the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for which Christ endured patiently; who at that time, indeed, by means of His patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, was prefiguring and declaring beforehand future things, fulfilling His part by anticipation in the dispensations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and accustoming His inheritance to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to pass through the world as in a state of pilgrimage, to follow His word, and to indicate beforehand things to come. For with God there is nothing without purpose or due signification.</p>
