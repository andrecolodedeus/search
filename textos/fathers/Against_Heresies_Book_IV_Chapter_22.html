<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 22)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Christ did not come for the sake of the men of one age only, but for all who, living righteously and piously, had believed upon Him; and for those, too, who shall believe.</span>

<p>1. Now in the last days, when the fullness of the time of liberty had arrived, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself did by Himself <q>wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014124"><a href="../bible/isa004.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;4:4</a></span> when He washed the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet with His own hands. <span class="stiki" id="note014125"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;13:5</a></span> For this is the end of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> inheriting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that as in the beginning, by means of our first [<a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>], we were all brought into bondage, by being made subject to death; so at last, by means of the New Man, all who from the beginning [were His] <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, having been cleansed and washed from things pertaining to death, should come to the life of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He who washed the feet of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> sanctified the entire body, and rendered it clean. For this reason, too, He administered food to them in a recumbent posture, indicating that those who were lying in the earth were they to whom He came to impart life. As Jeremiah declares, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord remembered His dead <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who slept in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them His  <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that they might be saved.</q>  For this reason also were the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> weighed down when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> passion was approaching; and when, in the first instance, the Lord found them sleeping, He let it pass&mdash;thus indicating the patience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in regard to the state of slumber in which men lay; but coming the second time, He aroused them, and made them stand up, in token that His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> is the arousing of His sleeping <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, on whose account <q>He also descended into the lower parts of the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014127"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> to behold with His eyes the state of those who were resting from their labours,  in reference to whom He did also declare to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>Many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and righteous men have desired to see and hear what you see and hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014129"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;13:17</a></span> </p>

<p>2. For it was not merely for those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him in the time of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a> that Christ came, nor did the Father exercise His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> for the men only who are now alive, but for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> altogether, who from the beginning, according to their capacity, in their generation have both feared and loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and practised <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards their neighbours, and have earnestly desired to see Christ, and to hear His voice. Wherefore He shall, at His second coming, first rouse from their sleep all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of this description, and shall raise them up, as well as the rest who shall be judged, and give them a place in His kingdom. For it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <q>one God who</q> directed the patriarchs towards His dispensations, and <q>has justified the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the uncircumcision through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014130"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;3:30</a></span> For as in the first we were prefigured, so, on the other hand, are they represented in us, that is, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and receive the recompense for those things which they accomplished.</p>
