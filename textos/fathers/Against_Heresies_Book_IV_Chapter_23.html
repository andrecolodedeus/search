<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 23)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The patriarchs and prophets by pointing out the advent of Christ, fortified thereby, as it were, the way of posterity to the faith of Christ; and so the labours of the apostles were lessened inasmuch as they gathered in the fruits of the labours of others.</span>

<p>1. For which reason the Lord declared to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look upon the districts (<em>regiones</em>), for they are white [already] to harvest. For the harvest-man receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that both he that sows and he that reaps may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> together. For in this is the saying <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that one sows and another reaps. For I have sent you forward to reap that whereon you bestowed no labour; other men have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014131"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;4:35</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Who, then, are they that have laboured, and have helped forward the dispensations of God? It is clear that they are the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who even prefigured our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and disseminated through the earth the advent of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who and what He should be: so that posterity, possessing the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, might easily accept the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, having been instructed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And for this reason it was, that when Joseph became aware that Mary was with child, and was minded to put her away privily, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to him in sleep: <q>Fear not to take to you Mary your wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014132"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And exhorting him [to this], he added: <q>Now all this has been done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and His name shall be called <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>;</q> thus influencing him by the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and warding off blame from Mary, pointing out that it was she who was the virgin mentioned by Isaiah beforehand, who should give birth to <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>. Wherefore, when Joseph was convinced beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, he both did take Mary, and joyfully yielded <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> in regard to all the rest of the education of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, undertaking a journey into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and back again, and then a removal to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. [For this reason,] those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> nor the promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, at last called him the father of the child. For this reason, too, did the Lord Himself read at Capernaum the prophecies of Isaiah: <span class="stiki" id="note014133"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;4:18</a></span> <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon Me, because He has anointed Me; to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the poor has He sent Me, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014134"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> At the same time, showing that it was He Himself who had been foretold by Esaias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, He said to them: <q>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.</q></p>

<p>2. For this reason, also, Philip, when he had discovered the eunuch of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians'</a> queen reading these words which had been written: <q>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken away;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014135"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse27">Acts&nbsp;8:27</a>; <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> and all the rest which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> proceeded to relate in regard  to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and His coming in the flesh, and how He was dishonoured by those who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him; easily persuaded him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, that He was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, and suffered whatsoever the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had predicted, and that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who gives <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to men. And immediately when [Philip] had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him, he departed from him. For nothing else [but <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>] was wanting to him who had been already instructed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: he was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor of the rules as to the [proper] manner of life, but was merely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the advent of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which, when he had become acquainted with, in a short space of time, he went on his way rejoicing, to be the herald in <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> advent. Therefore Philip had no great labour to go through with regard to this man, because he was already prepared in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For this reason, too, did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, collecting the sheep which had perished of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and discoursing to them from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, prove that this crucified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and they persuaded a great multitude, who, however, [already] possessed the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And there were, in one day, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> three, and four, and five thousand men. <span class="stiki" id="note014136"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse41">Acts&nbsp;2:41</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;4:4</a></span> </p>
