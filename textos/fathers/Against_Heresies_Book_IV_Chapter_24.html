<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 24)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The conversion of the Gentiles was more difficult than that of the Jews; the labours of those apostles, therefore who engaged in the former task, were greater than those who undertook the latter.</span>

<p>1. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, since he was the apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, says, <q>I laboured more than they all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014137"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:10</a></span> For the instruction of the former, [viz., the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,] was an easy task, because they could allege <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and because they, who were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of hearing <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, did also readily receive the First-begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the life of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, &mdash; Him who, by the spreading forth of hands, did destroy Amalek, and vivify man from the wound of the serpent, by means of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was [exercised] towards Him. As I have pointed out in the preceding book, the apostle did, in the first place, instruct the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to depart from the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and to worship one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of heaven and earth, and the Framer of the whole creation; and that His Son was His Word, by whom He founded all things; and that He, in the last times, was made a man among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; that He reformed the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, but destroyed and conquered the enemy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and gave to His handiwork victory against the adversary. But although they who were of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> still did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for they were despisers, yet they were previously instructed not to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, nor fornication, nor theft, nor fraud; and that whatsoever things are done to our neighbours' prejudice, were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and detested by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore also they did readily agree to abstain from these things, because they had been thus instructed.</p>

<p>2. But they were bound to teach the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also this very thing, that works of such a nature were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, prejudicial, and useless, and destructive to those who engaged in them. Wherefore he who had received the apostolate to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,  did labour more than those who preached the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> among them of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. For they were assisted by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which the Lord confirmed and fulfilled, in coming such as He had been announced; but here, [in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,] there was a certain foreign erudition, and a new doctrine [to be received, namely], that the gods of the nations not only were no gods at all, but even the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, who is <q>above all principality, and dominion, and power, and every name which is named;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014139"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse21">Ephesians&nbsp;1:21</a></span> and that His Word, invisible by nature, was made palpable and visible among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and did descend <q>to death, even the death of the cross;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014140"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> also, that they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him shall be incorruptible and not subject to suffering, and shall receive the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. These things, too, were preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by word, without [the aid of] the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>: wherefore, also, they who preached among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> underwent greater labour. But, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be of a more noble description, since they followed the word of God without the instruction [derived] from the [sacred] writings (<em>sine instructione literarum</em>).</p>
