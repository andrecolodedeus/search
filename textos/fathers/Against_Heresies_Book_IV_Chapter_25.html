<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 25)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Both covenants were prefigured in Abraham, and in the labour of Tamar; there was, however, but one and the same God to each covenant.</span>

<p>1. For thus it had behooved the sons of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> [to be], whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has raised up to him from the stones, <span class="stiki" id="note014141"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;3:9</a></span> and caused to take a place beside him who was made the chief and the forerunner of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (who did also receive the covenant of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, after that justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which had pertained to him, when he was yet in uncircumcision, so that in him both covenants might be prefigured, that he might be  the father of all who follow the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and who sustain a life of pilgrimage in this world, that is, of those who from among the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and of those from among the uncircumcision are faithful, even as also <q>Christ <span class="stiki" id="note014142"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse20">Ephesians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> is the chief corner-stone</q> sustaining all things); and He gathered into the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> those who, from either covenant, are eligible for God's building. But this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in uncircumcision, as connecting the end with the beginning, has been made [both] the first and the last. For, as I have shown, it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> antecedently to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as it also did in the rest of the righteous who pleased God: and in these last times, it again sprang up among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> through the coming of the Lord. But <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the law of works occupied the intervening period. </p>

<p>2. This fact is indeed set forth by many other [occurrences], but typically by [the history of] Thamar, Judah's daughter-in-law. <span class="stiki" id="note014144"><a href="../bible/gen038.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;38:28</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> For when she had conceived twins, one of them put forth his hand first; and as the midwife supposed that he was the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, she bound a scarlet token on his hand. But after this had been done, and he had drawn back his hand, his brother Phares came forth the first; then, after him, Zara, upon whom was the scarlet line, [was born] the second: the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> clearly pointing out that people which possessed the scarlet sign, that is, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a state of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which was shown beforehand, indeed, in the patriarchs first; but after that withdrawn, that his brother might be born; and also, in like manner, him who was the elder, as being born in the second place, [him] who was distinguished by the scarlet token which was [fastened] on him, that is, the passion of the Just One, which was prefigured from the beginning in Abel, and described by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but perfected in the last times in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>3. For it was requisite that certain facts should be announced beforehand by the fathers in a paternal manner, and others prefigured by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in a legal one, but others, described after the form of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by those who have received the adoption; while in one God are all things shown forth. For although <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was one, he did in himself prefigure the two covenants, in which some indeed have sown, while others have reaped; for it is said, <q>In this is the saying <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that it is one 'people' who sows, but another who shall reap;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014145"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;4:37</a></span> but it is one God who bestows things suitable upon both&mdash; seed to the sower, but bread for the reaper to eat. Just as it is one that plants, and another who waters, but one God who gives the increase. <span class="stiki" id="note014146"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:7</a></span> For the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> sowed the word [concerning] Christ, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reaped, that is, received the fruit. For this reason, too, do these very men (the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>) also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to have a dwelling-place in it, as Jeremiah says, <q>Who will give me in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> the last dwelling-place?</q>  in order that both the sower and the reaper may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> together in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is present with all those who were from the beginning approved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who granted them His Word to be present with them. </p>
