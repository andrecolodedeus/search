<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 26)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The treasure hid in the Scriptures is Christ; the true exposition of the Scriptures is to be found in the Church alone.</span>

<p>1. If any one, therefore, reads the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> with attention, he will find in them an account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and a foreshadowing of the new calling (<em>vocationis</em>). For Christ is the treasure which was hid in the field, <span class="stiki" id="note014149"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;13:44</a></span> that is, in this world (for <q>the field is the world</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014150"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;13:38</a></span>); but the treasure hid in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> is Christ, since He was pointed out by means of types and <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>. Hence His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> could not  be understood, prior to the consummation of those things which had been predicted, that is, the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And therefore it was said to Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Shut up the words, and seal the book even to the time of consummation, until many learn, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> be completed. For at that time, when the dispersion shall be accomplished, they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014152"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse4">Daniel&nbsp;12:4,&nbsp;7</a></span> But Jeremiah also says, <q>In the last days they shall understand these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014153"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse20">Jeremiah&nbsp;23:20</a></span> For every <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, before its fulfilment, is to men [full of] enigmas and ambiguities. But when the time has arrived, and the prediction has come to pass, then the prophecies have a clear and certain exposition. And for this reason, indeed, when at this present time the law is read to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, it is like a fable; for they do not possess the explanation of all things pertaining to the advent of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which took place in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; but when it is read by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, it is a treasure, hid indeed in a field, but brought to light by the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and  explained, both enriching the understanding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and showing forth the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and declaring His dispensations with regard to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and forming the kingdom of Christ beforehand, and preaching by anticipation the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Jerusalem, and proclaiming beforehand that the man who loves God shall arrive at such excellency as even to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hear His word, and from the hearing of His discourse be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> to such an extent, that others cannot behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his countenance, as was said by Daniel: <q>Those who do understand, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and many of the righteous  as the stars for ever and ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014155"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse3">Daniel&nbsp;12:3</a></span> Thus, then, I have shown it to be,  if any one read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For thus it was that the Lord discoursed with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead, proving to them from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves <q>that Christ must suffer, and enter into His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His name throughout all the world.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> will be perfected, and [rendered] like the householder, <q>who brings forth from his treasure things new and old.</q> </p>

<p>2. Wherefore it is incumbent to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who are in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;those who, as I have shown, possess the succession from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; those who, together with the succession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, have received the certain gift of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to the good pleasure of the Father. But [it is also incumbent] to hold in suspicion others who depart from the primitive succession, and assemble themselves together in any place whatsoever, [looking upon them] either as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of perverse minds, or as schismatics puffed up and self-pleasing, or again as hypocrites, acting thus for the sake of lucre and vainglory. For all these have fallen from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, indeed, who bring strange fire to the altar of God&mdash; namely, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>&mdash; shall be burned up by the fire from heaven, as were Nadab and Abiud. <span class="stiki" id="note014159"><a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse1">Leviticus&nbsp;10:1-2</a></span> But such as rise up in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and exhort others against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, [shall] remain among those in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> (<em>apud inferos</em>), being swallowed up by an earthquake, even as those who were with Chore, Dathan, and Abiron. <span class="stiki" id="note014160"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse33">Numbers&nbsp;16:33</a></span> But those who cleave asunder, and separate the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, [shall] receive from God the same punishment as <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> did. <span class="stiki" id="note014161"><a href="../bible/1ki014.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;14:10</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Those, however, who are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> by many, but serve their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and, do not place the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God supreme in their hearts, but conduct themselves with contempt towards others, and are puffed up with the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of holding the chief seat, and work <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> in secret, saying, <q>No man sees us,</q> shall be convicted by the Word, who does not judge after outward appearance (<em>secundum gloriam</em>), nor looks upon the countenance, but the heart; and they shall hear those words, to be found in Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>O you seed of Canaan, and not of Judah, beauty has deceived you, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> perverted your heart.  You that are waxen old in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> days, now your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which you have committed aforetime have come to light; for you have pronounced false judgments, and have been accustomed to condemn the innocent, and to let the guilty go free, albeit the Lord says, The innocent and the righteous shall you not slay.</q>  Of whom also did the Lord say: <q>But if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and shall begin to smite the man-servants and maidens, and to eat and drink and be drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day that he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</q> </p>

<p>4. From all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore, it behooves us to keep aloof, but to adhere to those who, as I have already observed, do hold the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and who, together with the order of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (<em>presbyterii ordine</em>), display sound speech and blameless conduct for the confirmation and correction of others.  In this way, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, to whom such a leadership was entrusted, relying on a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, cleared himself before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <q>I have not in <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> taken anything belonging to one of these men, nor have I done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to one of them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014166"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse15">Numbers&nbsp;16:15</a></span> In this way, too, Samuel, who judged the people so many years, and bore rule over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> without any <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, in the end cleared himself, saying, <q>I have walked before you from my childhood even unto this day: answer me in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and before His anointed (<em>Christi ejus</em>); whose ox or whose ass of yours have I taken, or over whom have I tyrannized, or whom have I oppressed? Or if I have received from the hand of any a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> or [so much as] a shoe, speak out  against me, and I will restore it to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014167"><a href="../bible/1sa012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:3</a></span> And when the people had said to him, <q>You have not tyrannized, neither have you oppressed us, neither have you taken ought of any man's hand,</q> he called the Lord to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, saying, <q>The Lord is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and His Anointed is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> this day, that you have not found ought in my hand. And they said to him, He is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>.</q> In this strain also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, inasmuch as he had a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, said to the Corinthians: <q>For we are not as many, who corrupt the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>: but as of sincerity, but as of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the sight of God speak we in Christ;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014168"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:17</a></span> <q>We have injured no man, corrupted no man, circumvented no man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014169"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:2</a></span> </p>

<p>5. Such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nourish, of whom also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: <q>I will give your rulers in peace, and your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014170"><a href="../bible/isa060.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;60:17</a></span> Of whom also did the Lord declare, <q>Who then shall be a faithful steward (<em>actor</em>), good and wise, whom the Lord sets over His household, to give them their meat in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He comes, shall find so doing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014171"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;24:45-46</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> then, teaching us where one may find such, says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has placed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, first, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; secondly, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; thirdly, teachers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014172"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:28</a></span> Where, therefore, the gifts of the Lord have been placed, there it behooves us to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, [namely,] from those who possess that succession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  and among whom exists that which is sound and blameless in conduct, as well as that which is unadulterated and incorrupt in speech. For these also preserve this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of ours in one God who created all things; and they increase that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> [which we have] for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who accomplished such marvellous dispensations for our sake: and they expound the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to us without danger, neither <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor dishonouring the patriarchs, nor despising the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>
