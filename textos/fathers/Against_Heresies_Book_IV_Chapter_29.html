<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 29)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Refutation of the arguments of the Marcionites, who attempted to show that God was the author of sin, because He blinded Pharaoh and his servants.</span>

<p>1. <q>But,</q> say they, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hardened the heart of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and of his servants.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014208"><a href="../bible/exo009.htm#verse35">Exodus&nbsp;9:35</a></span> Those, then, who allege such difficulties, do not read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that passage where the Lord replied to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when they asked Him, <q>Why do You speak unto them in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>?</q>&mdash; <q>Because it is given unto you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; but to them I speak in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not hear, understanding they may not understand; in order that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah regarding them may be fulfilled, saying, Make the heart of this people gross and make their ears dull, and blind their eyes. But blessed are your eyes, which see the things that you see; and your ears, which hear what you hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014209"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;13:11-16</a>; <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;6:10</a></span> For one and the same God [that blesses others] inflicts blindness upon those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but who set Him at naught; just as the sun, which is a creature of His, [acts with regard] to those who, by reason of any weakness of the eyes cannot behold his light; but to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him and follow Him, He grants a fuller and greater illumination of mind. In accordance with this word, therefore, does the apostle say, in the Second [Epistle] to the Corinthians: <q>In whom the this world has blinded the minds of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, lest the light of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ should shine [unto them].</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014210"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> And again, in that to the Romans: <q>And as they did not think fit to have God in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, God gave them up to a reprobate <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to do those things that are not convenient.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014211"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;1:28</a></span> Speaking of antichrist, too, he says clearly in the Second to the Thessalonians: <q>And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God shall send them the working of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; that they all might be judged who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but consented to iniquity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014212"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> </p>

<p>2. If, therefore, in the present time also, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the number of those who will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, since He foreknows all things, has given them over to unbelief, and turned away His face from men of this stamp, leaving them in the darkness which they have themselves chosen for themselves, what is there wonderful if He did also at that time give over to their unbelief, <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, who never would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, along with those who were with him? As the Word spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from the bush: <q>And I am sure that the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> will not let you go, unless by a mighty hand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014213"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse19">Exodus&nbsp;3:19</a></span> And for the reason that the Lord spoke in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and brought blindness upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that seeing they might not see, since He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the [spirit of] unbelief in them, for the same reason did He harden <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> heart; in order that, while seeing that it was the finger of God which led forth the people, he might not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but be precipitated into a sea of unbelief, resting in the notion that the exit of these [<a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>] was accomplished by magical power, and that it was not by the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> afforded a passage to the people, but that this occurred by merely natural causes (<em>sed naturaliter sic se habere</em>).</p>
