<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 31)</h1>

<span class="h1a">We should not hastily impute as crimes to the men of old time those actions which the Scripture has not condemned, but should rather seek in them types of things to come: an example of this in the incest committed by Lot.</span>

<p>1. When recounting certain matters of this kind respecting them of old time, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> [before mentioned] was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of instructing us, and saying: <q>With respect to those misdeeds for which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves blame the patriarchs and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, we ought not to inveigh against them, nor become like Ham, who ridiculed the shame of his father, and so fell under a curse; but we should [rather] give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their behalf, inasmuch as their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have been forgiven them through the advent of our Lord; for He said that they gave thanks [for us], and gloried in our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  With respect to those actions, again, on which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> pass no censure, but which are simply set down [as having occurred], we ought not to become the accusers [of those who committed them], for we are not more exact than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor can we be superior to our Master; but we should search for a type [in them]. For not one of those things which have been set down in Scripture without being condemned is without significance.</q> An example is found in the case of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, who led forth his daughters from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and these then conceived by their own father; and who left behind him within the confines [of the land] his wife, [who remains] a pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> unto this day. For <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, not acting under the impulse of his own will, nor at the prompting of carnal concupiscence, nor having any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or thought of anything of the kind, did [in fact] work out a type [of future events]. As says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>: <q>And that night the elder went in  and lay with her father; and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014230"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse33">Genesis&nbsp;19:33</a></span> And the same thing took place in the case of the younger: <q>And he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not,</q> it is said, <q>when she slept with him, nor when she arose.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014231"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse35">Genesis&nbsp;19:35</a></span> Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not [what he did], nor was a slave to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> [in his actions], the arrangement [designed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>] was carried out, by which the two daughters (that is, the two churches ), who gave birth to children begotten of one and the same father, were pointed out, apart from [the influence of] the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh. For there was no other person, [as they supposed], who could impart to them quickening seed, and the means of their giving birth to children, as it is written: <q>And the elder said unto the younger, And there is not a man on the earth to enter in unto us after the manner of all the earth: come, let us make our father drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, and raise up seed from our father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014233"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse31">Genesis&nbsp;19:31-32</a></span> </p>

<p>2. Thus, after their simplicity and innocence, did these daughters [of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>] so speak, imagining that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> had perished, even as the Sodomites had done, and that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God had come down upon the whole earth. Wherefore also they are to be held excusable, since they supposed that they only, along with their father, were left for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and for this reason it was that they deceived their father. Moreover, by the words they used this fact was pointed out&mdash; that there is no other one who can confer upon the elder and younger church the [power of] giving birth to children, besides our Father. Now the father of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> points out when he says, <q>Is not He your father who has obtained you [by generation], and formed you, and created you?</q>  At what time, then, did He pour out upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> the life-giving seed&mdash; that is, the Spirit of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, through means of whom we are quickened? Was it not then, when He was eating with men, and drinking wine upon the earth? For it is said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came eating and drinking;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014235"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;11:19</a></span> and when He had lain down, He fell asleep, and took repose. As He does Himself say in David, <q>I slept, and took repose.</q>  And because He used thus to act while He dwelt and lived among us, He says again, <q>And my sleep became sweet unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014237"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse26">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:26</a></span> Now this whole matter was indicated through <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, that the seed of the Father of all&mdash; that is, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, by whom all things were made&mdash; was commingled and united with flesh&mdash; that is, with His own workmanship; by which commixture and unity the two <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>&mdash; that is, the two churches&mdash; produced from their own father living sons to the living God.</p>

<p>3. And while these things were taking place, his wife remained in [the territory of] Sodore, no longer corruptible flesh, but a pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> which endures for ever;  and by those natural processes  which appertain to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, indicating that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also, which is the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth, <span class="stiki" id="note014240"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;5:13</a></span> has been left behind within the confines of the earth, and subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sufferings; and while entire members are often taken away from it, the pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> still endures,  thus typifying the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which makes strong, and sends forward, children to their Father.</p>
