<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 32)</h1>

<span class="h1a">That one God was the author of both Testaments, is confirmed by the authority of a presbyter who had been taught by the apostles.</span>

<p>1. After this fashion also did a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>,  a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, reason with respect to the two testaments, proving that both were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> from one and the same God. For [he maintained] that there was no other God besides Him who made and fashioned us, and that the discourse of those men has no foundation who affirm that this world of ours was made either by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or by any other power whatsoever, or by another God. For if a man be once moved away from the Creator of all things, and if he grant that this creation to which we belong was formed by any other or through any other [than the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>], he must of necessity fall into much inconsistency, and many contradictions of this sort; to which he will [be able to] furnish  no explanations which can be regarded as either probable or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And, for this reason, those who introduce other doctrines conceal from us the opinion which they themselves hold respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they are aware of the untenable  and absurd nature of their doctrine, and are afraid lest, should they be vanquished, they should have some difficulty in making good their escape. But if any one believes in [only] one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who also made all things by the Word, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> likewise says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, Let there be light: and there was light;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014244"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and as we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>All things were made by Him; and without Him was nothing made;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014245"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> [says] in like manner, <q>There is one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one God and Father, who is above all, and through all, and in us all</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014246"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;4:5-6</a></span> &mdash; this man will first of all <q>hold the head, from which the whole body is compacted and bound together, and, through means of every joint according to the measure of the ministration of each several part, makes increase of the body to the edification of itself in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014247"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse16">Ephesians&nbsp;4:16</a>; <a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse19">Colossians&nbsp;2:19</a></span> And then shall every word also seem consistent to him,  if he for his part diligently read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in company with those who are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, among whom is the apostolic doctrine, as I have pointed out.</p>

<p>2. For all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> taught that there were indeed two testaments among the two peoples; but that it was one and the same God who appointed both for the advantage of those men (for whose  sakes the testaments were given) who were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the third book from the very teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and that the first testament was not given without reason, or to no purpose, or in an accidental sort of manner; but that it subdued  those to whom it was given to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for their benefit (for God needs no service from men), and exhibited a type of heavenly things, inasmuch as man was not yet able to see the things of God through means of immediate vision;  and foreshadowed the images of those things which [now actually] exist in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in order that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might be firmly established;  and contained a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of things to come, in order that man might learn that God has foreknowledge of all things.</p>
