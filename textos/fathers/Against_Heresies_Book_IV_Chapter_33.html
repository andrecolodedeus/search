<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 33)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Whosoever confesses that one God is the author of both Testaments, and diligently reads the Scriptures in company with the presbyters of the Church, is a true spiritual disciple; and he will rightly understand and interpret all that the prophets have declared respecting Christ and the liberty of the New Testament.</span>

<p>1. A spiritual <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of this sort <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, who was from the beginning, in all the dispensations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, present with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and announced things future, revealed things present, and narrated things past&mdash; [such a man] does indeed <q>judge all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but is himself judged by no man.</q>  For he judges the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <q>who serve the creature more than the Creator,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014254"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21</a></span> and with a reprobate mind spend all their labour on vanity. And he also judges the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who do not accept of the word of liberty, nor are willing to go forth free, although they have a Deliverer present [with them]; but they pretend, at a time unsuitable [for such conduct], to serve, [with observances] beyond [those required by] the law, God who stands in need of nothing, and do not recognise the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which He accomplished for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor are willing to understand that all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> announced His two advents: the one, indeed, in which He became a man subject to stripes, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what it is to bear infirmity, <span class="stiki" id="note014255"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;53:3</a></span> and sat upon the foal of an ass, <span class="stiki" id="note014256"><a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;9:9</a></span> and was a stone rejected by the builders,  and was led as a sheep to the slaughter, <span class="stiki" id="note014258"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> and by the stretching forth of His hands destroyed Amalek; <span class="stiki" id="note014259"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;17:11</a></span> while He gathered from the ends of the earth into His Father's fold the children who were scattered abroad, <span class="stiki" id="note014260"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;11:12</a></span> and remembered His own dead ones who had formerly fallen asleep,  and came down to them that He might deliver them: but the second in which He will come on the clouds, <span class="stiki" id="note014262"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13</a></span> bringing on the day which burns as a furnace, <span class="stiki" id="note014263"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse1">Malachi&nbsp;4:1</a></span> and smiting the earth with the word of His mouth, <span class="stiki" id="note014264"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;11:4</a></span> and slaying the impious with the breath of His lips, and having a fan in His hands, and cleansing His floor, and gathering the wheat indeed into His barn, but burning the chaff with unquenchable fire. <span class="stiki" id="note014265"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;3:12</a>; <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;3:17</a></span> </p>

<p>2. Moreover, he shall also examine the doctrine  of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, [inquiring] how he holds that there are two gods, separated from each other by an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> distance.  Or how can he be good who draws away men that do not belong to him from him who made them, and calls them into his own kingdom? And why is his goodness, which does not save all [thus], defective? Also, why does he, indeed, seem to be good as respects men, but most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> with regard to him who made men, inasmuch as he deprives him of his possessions? Moreover, how could the Lord, with any <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if He belonged to another father, have acknowledged the bread to be His body, while He took it from that creation to which we belong, and affirmed the mixed cup to be His blood?  And why did He acknowledge Himself to be the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, if He had not gone through that birth which belongs to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being? How, too, could He forgive us those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for which we are answerable to our Maker and God? And how, again, supposing that He was not flesh, but was a man merely in appearance, could He have been crucified, and could blood and water have issued from His pierced side? <span class="stiki" id="note014268"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;19:34</a></span> What body, moreover, was it that those who buried Him consigned to the tomb? And what was that which rose again from the dead?</p>

<p>3. [This spiritual man] shall also judge all the followers of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, because they do indeed confess with the tongue one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that all things derive their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from Him, but do at the same time maintain that He who formed all things is the fruit of an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> or defect. [He shall judge them, too, because] they do in like manner confess with the tongue one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but assign in their [system of] doctrine a production of his own to the Only-begotten, one of his own also to the Word, another to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and yet another to the Saviour; so that, according to them, all these beings are indeed said [in Scripture to be], as it were, one; [while they maintain], notwithstanding, that each one of them should be understood [to exist] separately [from the rest], and to have [had] his own special origin, according to his peculiar conjunction. [It appears], then  that their tongues alone, forsooth, have conceded the unity [of God], while their [real] opinion and their understanding (by their habit of investigating profundities) have fallen away from [this doctrine of] unity, and taken up the notion of manifold deities&mdash;[this, I say, must appear] when they shall be examined by Christ as to the points [of doctrine] which they have invented. Him, too, they affirm to have been born at a later period than the Pleroma of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, and that His production took place after [the occurrence of] a degeneracy or <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>; and they maintain that, on account of the passion which was experienced by Sophia, they themselves were brought to the birth. But their own special <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Homer, listening to whom they have invented such doctrines, shall himself reprove them, when he expresses himself as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p> <q>Hateful to me that man as Hades' gates, <br>Who one thing thinks, while he another states.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>[This spiritual man] shall also judge the vain speeches of the perverse <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, by showing that they are the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>.</p>

<p>4. He will judge also the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>; [for] how can they be saved unless it was God who wrought out their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> upon earth? Or how shall man pass into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless God has [first] passed into man? And how shall he (man) escape from the generation subject to death, if not by means  of a new generation, given in a wonderful and unexpected manner (but as a sign of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>) by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash; [I mean] that regeneration which flows from the virgin through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?  Or how shall they receive adoption from God if they remain in this [kind of] generation, which is naturally possessed by man in this world? And how could He (Christ) have been greater than Solomon, <span class="stiki" id="note014273"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;12:41-42</a></span> or greater than Jonah, or have been the Lord of David, <span class="stiki" id="note014274"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse43">Matthew&nbsp;22:43</a></span> who was of the same substance as they were? How, too, could He have subdued <span class="stiki" id="note014275"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;22:29</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;11:21-22</a></span> him who was stronger than men,  who had not only overcome man, but also retained him under his power, and conquered him who had conquered, while he set free <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> who had been conquered, unless He had been greater than man who had thus been vanquished? But who else is superior to, and more eminent than, that man who was formed after the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, after whose image man was created? And for this reason He did in these last days  exhibit the similitude; [for] the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was made man, assuming the ancient production [of His hands] into His own nature,  as I have shown in the immediately preceding book.</p>

<p>  5. He shall also judge those who describe Christ as [having become man] only in [<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>] opinion. For how can they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they do themselves carry on a real discussion, when their Master was a mere imaginary being? Or how can they receive anything steadfast from Him, if He was a merely imagined being, and not a verity? And how can these men really be partaken of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, if He in whom they profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, manifested Himself as a merely imaginary being? Everything, therefore, connected with these men is unreal, and nothing [possessed of the character of] <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and, in these circumstances, it may be made a question whether (since, perchance, they themselves in like manner are not men, but mere dumb animals) they do not present,  in most cases, simply a shadow of humanity.</p>

<p>6. He shall also judge <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, who, without having received the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not possessed of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but either for the sake of vainglory, or with a view to some personal advantage, or acting in some other way under the influence of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit, pretend to utter prophecies, while all the time they lie against God.</p>

<p>7. He shall also judge those who give rise to schisms, who are destitute of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who look to their own special advantage rather than to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and who for trifling reasons, or any kind of reason which occurs to them, cut in pieces and divide the great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and so far as in them lies, [positively] destroy it&mdash;men who prate of peace while they give rise to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and do in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> strain out a gnat, but swallow a camel. <span class="stiki" id="note014280"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;23:24</a></span> For no reformation of so great importance can be effected by them, as will compensate for the mischief arising from their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. He shall also judge all those who are beyond the pale of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that is, who are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but he himself shall be judged by no one. For to him all things are consistent: he has a full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one God Almighty, of whom are all things; and in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, by whom are all things, and in the dispensations connected with Him, by means of which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> became man; and a firm belief in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who furnishes us with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and has set forth the dispensations of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in virtue of which He dwells with every generation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,  according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father.</p>

<p>8. True <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>  is [that which consists in] the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the ancient constitution  of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout all the world, and the distinctive manifestation of the body  of Christ according to the successions of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, by which they have handed down that Church which exists in every place, and has come even unto us, being guarded and preserved  without any forging of Scriptures, by a very complete system  of doctrine, and neither receiving addition nor [suffering] curtailment [in the truths which she believes]; and [it consists in] reading [the word of God] without falsification, and a lawful and diligent exposition in harmony with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, both without danger and without <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; and [above all, it consists in] the pre-eminent gift of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note014287"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:1</a>; <a href="../bible/1co013.htm">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13</a></span> which is more precious than <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and which excels all the other gifts [of God].</p>

<p>9. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does in every place, because of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which she cherishes towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, send forward, throughout all time, a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to the Father; while all others  not only have nothing of this kind to point to among themselves, but even maintain that such witness-bearing is not at all necessary, for that their system of doctrines is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> [for Christ], with the exception, perhaps, that one or two among them, during the whole time which has elapsed since the Lord appeared on earth, have occasionally, along with our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, borne the reproach of the name (as if he too [the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>] had obtained mercy), and have been led forth with them [to death], being, as it were, a sort of retinue granted unto them. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone sustains with purity the reproach of those who suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for righteousness' sake, and endure all sorts of punishments, and are <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> because of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which they bear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their confession of His Son; often weakened indeed, yet immediately increasing her members, and becoming whole again, after the same manner as her type,  <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife, who became a pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>. Thus, too, [she passes through an experience] similar to that of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as the Lord declares, <q>For so <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> they  the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who were before you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014290"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;5:12</a></span> inasmuch as she does indeed, in a new fashion, suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> from those who do not receive the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the self-same spirit rests upon her <span class="stiki" id="note014291"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:14</a></span> [as upon these ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>].</p>

<p>10. And indeed the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, along with other things which they predicted, also foretold this, that all those on whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> should rest, and who would <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and serve Him according to their ability, should suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> and slain. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> prefigured in themselves all these things, because of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on account of His word. For since they themselves were members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, each one of them in his place as a member did, in accordance with this, set forth the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> [assigned him]; all of them, although many, prefiguring only one, and proclaiming the things which pertain to one. For just as the working of the whole body is exhibited through means of our members, while the figure of a complete man is not displayed by one member, but through means of all taken together, so also did all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> prefigure the one [Christ]; while every one of them, in his special place as a member, did, in accordance with this, fill up the [established] dispensation, and shadowed forth beforehand that particular working of Christ which was connected with that member.</p>

<p>11. For some of them, beholding Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> life (<em>conversationem</em>) at the Father's right hand;  others beheld Him coming on the clouds as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note014293"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13</a></span> and those who declared regarding Him, <q>They shall look on Him whom they have pierced,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014294"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse10">Zechariah&nbsp;12:10</a></span> indicated His [second] advent, concerning which He Himself says, <q>Do you think that when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> comes, He shall find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?</q>  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also refers to this event when he says, <q>If, however, it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you that are troubled rest with us, at the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> from heaven, with His mighty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and in a flame of fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014296"><a href="../bible/2th001.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;1:6-8</a></span> Others again, speaking of Him as a judge, and [referring], as if it were a burning furnace, [to] the day of the Lord, who <q>gathers the wheat into His barn, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014297"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;3:12</a></span> were accustomed to threaten those who were unbelieving, concerning whom also the Lord Himself declares, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, which my Father has prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014298"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> And the apostle in like manner says [of them], <q>Who shall be punished with everlasting death from the face of the Lord, and from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His power, when He shall come to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and to be admired in those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014299"><a href="../bible/2th001.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;1:9-10</a></span> There are also some [of them] who declare, <q>You are fairer than the children of men;</q>  and, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows;</q>  and, <q>Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Most Mighty, with Your beauty and Your fairness, and go forward and proceed prosperously; and rule You because of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and meekness, and righteousness.</q>  And whatever other things of a like nature are spoken regarding Him, these indicated that beauty and splendour which exist in His kingdom, along with the transcendent and pre-eminent exaltation [belonging] to all who are under His sway, that those who hear might desire to be found there, doing such things as are pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, there are those who say, <q>He is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him?</q>  and, <q>I came unto the prophetess, and she bore a son, and His name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and those [of them] who proclaimed Him as Immanuel, [born] of the Virgin, exhibited the union of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> with His own workmanship, [declaring] that the Word should become flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> (the pure One opening purely that pure womb which regenerates men unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which He Himself made pure); and having become this which we also are, He [nevertheless] is the Mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and possesses a generation which cannot be declared. And there are also some of them who say, <q>The Lord has spoken in Zion, and uttered His voice from Jerusalem;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014305"><a href="../bible/joe003.htm#verse16">Joel&nbsp;3:16</a></span> and, <q>In Judah is God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>;</q> &mdash; these indicated His advent which took place in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. Those, again, who declare that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> comes from the south, and from a mountain thick with foliage,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014307"><a href="../bible/hab003.htm#verse3">Habakkuk&nbsp;3:3</a></span> announced His advent at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, as I have pointed out in the preceding book.  From that place, also, He who rules, and who feeds the people of His Father, has come. Those, again, who declare that at His coming <q>the lame man shall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall  [speak] plainly, and the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014309"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;35:5-6</a></span> and that <q>the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, shall be strengthened,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014310"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;35:3</a></span> and that <q>the dead which are in the grave shall arise,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014311"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;26:19</a></span> and that He Himself <q>shall take [upon Him] our weaknesses, and bear our sorrows,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014312"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;53:4</a></span> &mdash; [all these] proclaimed those works of healing which were accomplished by Him.</p>

<p>12. Some of them, moreover&mdash; [when they predicted that] as a weak and inglorious man, and as one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what it was to bear infirmity, <span class="stiki" id="note014313"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;53:3</a></span> and sitting upon the foal of an ass, <span class="stiki" id="note014314"><a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;9:9</a></span> He should come to Jerusalem; and that He should give His back to stripes, <span class="stiki" id="note014315"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;50:6</a></span> and His cheeks to palms [which struck Him]; and that He should be led as a sheep to the slaughter; <span class="stiki" id="note014316"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> and that He should have vinegar and gall given Him to drink;  and that He should be forsaken by His friends and those nearest to Him;  and that He should stretch forth His hands the whole day long; <span class="stiki" id="note014319"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;65:2</a></span> and that He should be mocked and maligned by those who looked upon Him;  and that His garments should be parted, and lots cast upon His raiment;  and that He should be brought down to the dust of death  with all [the other] things of a like nature&mdash; prophesied His coming in the character of a man as He entered Jerusalem, in which by His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and crucifixion He endured all the things which have been mentioned. Others, again, when they said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord remembered His own dead ones who slept in the dust, and came down to them to raise them up, that He might save them,</q>  furnished us with the reason on account of which He suffered all these things. Those, moreover, who said, <q>In that day, says the Lord, the sun shall go down at noon, and there shall be darkness over the earth in the clear day; and I will turn your feast days into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014324"><a href="../bible/amo008.htm#verse9">Amos&nbsp;8:9-10</a></span> plainly announced that obscuration of the sun which at the time of His crucifixion took place from the sixth hour onwards, and that after this event, those days which were their festivals according to the law, and their songs, should be changed into grief and lamentation when they were handed over to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Jeremiah, too, makes this point still clearer, when he thus speaks concerning Jerusalem: <q>She that has born [seven] languishes; her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has become weary; her sun has gone down while it was yet noon; she has been confounded, and suffered reproach: the remainder of them will I give to the sword in the sight of their enemies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014325"><a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;15:9</a></span> </p>

<p>13. Those of them, again, who spoke of His having slumbered and taken sleep, and of His having risen again because the Lord sustained Him,  and who enjoined the principalities of heaven to set open the everlasting doors, that the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> might go in,  proclaimed beforehand His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead through the Father's power, and His reception into heaven. And when they expressed themselves thus, <q>His going forth is from the height of heaven, and His returning even to the highest heaven; and there is no one who can hide himself from His heat,</q>  they announced that very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His being taken up again to the place from which He came down, and that there is no one who can escape His righteous judgment. And those who said, <q>The Lord has reigned; let the people be enraged: [even] He who sits upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>; let the earth be moved,</q>  were thus predicting partly that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> from all nations which after His ascension came upon those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, with the movement of the whole earth against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and partly the fact that, when He comes from heaven with His mighty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the whole earth shall be shaken, as He Himself declares, <q>There shall be a great earthquake, such as has not been from the beginning.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014330"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;24:21</a></span> And again, when one says, <q>Whosoever is judged, let him stand opposite; and whosoever is justified, let him draw near to the servant  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and, <q>Woe unto you, for you shall wax old as does a garment, and the moth shall eat you up;</q> and, <q>All flesh shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in the highest,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014333"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;2:17</a></span> &mdash; it is thus indicated that, after His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and ascension, God shall cast down under His feet all who were opposed to Him, and He shall be exalted above all, and there shall be no one who can be justified or compared to Him.</p>

<p>14. And those of them who declare that God would make a new covenant <span class="stiki" id="note014334"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse31">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:31-32</a></span> with men, not such as that which He made with the fathers at Mount Horeb, and would give to men a new heart and a new spirit; <span class="stiki" id="note014335"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse26">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:26</a></span> and again, <q>And remember not the things of old: behold, I  make new things which shall now arise, and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it; and I will make a way in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and rivers in a dry land, to give drink to my chosen people, my people whom I have acquired, that they may show forth my praise,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014336"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;43:19-21</a></span> &mdash; plainly announced that liberty which distinguishes the new covenant, and the new wine which is put into new bottles, <span class="stiki" id="note014337"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;9:17</a></span> [that is], the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which He has proclaimed the way of righteousness sprung up in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and the streams of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in a dry land, to give water to the elect people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom He has acquired, that they might show forth His praise, but not that they might <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him who made these things, that is, God.</p>

<p>15. And all those other points which I have shown the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to have uttered by means of so long a series of Scriptures, he who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> spiritual will interpret by pointing out, in regard to every one of the things which have been spoken, to what special point in the dispensation of the Lord is referred, and [by thus exhibiting] the entire system of the work of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> always the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and always acknowledging the same <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, although He has [but] now been manifested to us; acknowledging also at all times the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, although He has been poured out upon us after a new fashion in these last times, [<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He descends] even from the creation of the world to its end upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> simply as such, from whom those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God and follow His word receive that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which flows from Him. Those, on the other hand, who depart from Him, and despise His precepts, and by their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> bring dishonour on Him who made them, and by their opinions <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him who nourishes them, heap up against themselves most righteous judgment. <span class="stiki" id="note014338"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;2:5</a></span> He therefore (i.e., the spiritual man) sifts and tries them all, but he himself is tried by no man: <span class="stiki" id="note014339"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> he neither blasphemes his Father, nor sets aside His dispensations, nor inveighs against the fathers, nor dishonours the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, by maintaining that they were [sent] from another God [than he worships], or again, that their prophecies were derived from different sources. </p>
