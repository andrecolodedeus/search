<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 35)</h1>

<span class="h1a">A refutation of those who allege that the prophets uttered some predictions under the inspiration of the highest, others from the Demiurge. Disagreements of the Valentinians among themselves with regard to these same predictions.</span>

<p>1. Then again, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, who maintain that some parts of Scripture were spoken at one time from the Pleroma (<em>a summitate</em>) through means of the seed [derived] from that place, but at another time from the intermediate abode through means of the audacious mother Prunica, but that many are due to the Creator of the world, from whom also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had their mission, we say that it is altogether irrational to bring down the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to such straits, as that He should not be possessed of His own proper instruments, by which the things in the Pleroma might be perfectly proclaimed. For of whom was He afraid, so that He should not reveal His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> after His own way and independently, freely, and without being involved with that spirit which came into being in a state of degeneracy and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? Was it that He feared that very many would be saved, when more should have listened to the unadulterated <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Or, on the other hand, was He incapable of preparing for Himself those who should announce the Saviour's advent?</p>

<p>2. But if, when the Saviour came to this earth, He sent His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> into the world to proclaim with accuracy His advent, and to teach the Father's will, having nothing in common with the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, much more, while yet existing in the Pleroma, would He have appointed His own heralds to proclaim His future advent into this world, and having nothing in common with those prophecies originating from the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>. But if, when within the Pleroma, He availed Himself of those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who were under the law, and declared His own matters through their instrumentality; much more would He, upon His arrival hither, have made use of these same teachers, and have preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to us by their means. Therefore let them not any longer assert that Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but that it was the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and the others, through whom the law was propounded. But if, at His advent, He sent forth His own <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not in that of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, He did the very same also in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was always the self-same: and if the Spirit from the Pleroma was, according to these men's system, the Spirit of light, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the Spirit of perfection, and the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while that from the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> was the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, degeneracy, and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and the offspring of obscurity; how can it be, that in one and the same being there exists perfection and defect, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, light and darkness? But if it was impossible that such should happen in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for they preached the word of the Lord from one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and proclaimed the advent of His Son, much more would the Lord Himself never have uttered words, on one occasion from above, but on another from degeneracy below, thus becoming the teacher at once of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; nor would He have ever <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> as Father at one time the Founder of the world, and at another Him who is above this one, as He does Himself declare: <q>No man puts a piece of a new garment upon an old one, nor do they put new wine into old bottles.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014352"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;5:36-37</a></span> Let these men, therefore, either have nothing whatever to do with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as with those that are ancients, and allege no longer that these men, being sent beforehand by the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, spoke certain things under that new influence which pertains to the Pleroma; or, on the other hand, let them be convinced by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, when He declares that new wine cannot be put into old bottles.</p>

<p>3. But from what source could the offspring of their mother derive his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> within the Pleroma, and power to discourse regarding them? Suppose that the mother, while beyond the Pleroma, did bring forth this very offspring; but what is beyond the Pleroma they represent as being beyond the pale of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that is, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. How, then, could that seed, which was conceived in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, possess the power of declaring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? Or how did the mother herself, a shapeless and undefined being, one cast out of doors as an <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a>, obtain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> within the Pleroma, she who was organized outside it and given a form there, and prohibited by Horos from entering within, and who remains outside the Pleroma till the consummation [of all things], that is, beyond the pale of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? Then, again, when they say that the Lord's passion is a type of the extension of the Christ above, which he effected through Horos, and so imparted a form to their mother, they are refuted in the other particulars [of the Lord's passion], for they have no semblance of a type to show with regard  to them. For when did the Christ above have vinegar and gall given him to drink? Or when was his raiment parted? Or when was he pierced, and blood and water came forth? Or when did he sweat great drops of blood? And [the same may be demanded] as to the other particulars which happened to the Lord, of which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have spoken. From whence, then, did the mother or her offspring divine the things which had not yet taken place, but which should occur afterwards?</p>

<p>4. They affirm that certain things still, besides these, were spoken from the Pleroma, but are confuted by those which are referred to in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> as bearing on the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But what these are [that are spoken from the Pleroma] they are not agreed, but give different answers regarding them. For if any one, wishing to test them, do question one by one with regard to any passage those who are their leading men, he shall find one of them referring the passage in question to the Propator&mdash; that is, to Bythus; another attributing it to Arche&mdash; that is, to the Only-begotten; another to the Father of all&mdash; that is, to the Word; while another, again, will say that it was spoken of that one <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> who was [formed from the joint contributions] of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> in the Pleroma;  others [will regard the passage] as referring to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while another [will refer it] to the Saviour. One, again, more skilled than these,  after a long protracted silence, declares that it was spoken of Horos; another that it signifies the Sophia which is within the Pleroma; another that it announces the mother outside the Pleroma; while another will mention the God who made the world (the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>). Such are the variations existing among them with regard to one [passage], holding discordant opinions as to the same Scriptures; and when the same identical passage is read out, they all begin to purse up their eyebrows, and to shake their heads, and they say that they might indeed utter a discourse transcendently lofty, but that all cannot comprehend the greatness of that thought which is implied in it; and that, therefore, among the wise the chief thing is silence. For that Sige (<em>silence</em>) which is above must be typified by that silence which they preserve. Thus do they, as many as they are, all depart [from each other], holding so many opinions as to one thing, and bearing about their clever notions in secret within themselves. When, therefore, they shall have agreed among themselves as to the things predicted in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, then also shall they be confuted by us. For, though holding wrong opinions, they do in the meanwhile, however, convict themselves, since they are not of one mind with regard to the same words. But as we follow for our teacher the one and only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and possess His words as the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we do all speak alike with regard to the same things, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, who sent the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who led forth the people from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who in these last times manifested His own Son, that He might put the unbelievers to confusion, and search out the fruit of righteousness.</p>
