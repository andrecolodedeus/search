<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 36)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The prophets were sent from one and the same Father from whom the Son was sent.</span>

<p>1. Which [God] the Lord does not reject, nor does He say that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> [spoke] from another god than His Father; nor from any other <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but from one and the same Father; nor that any other being made the things in the world, except His own Father, when He speaks as follows in His teaching: <q>There was a certain householder, and he planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dug in it a winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants unto the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the husbandmen took his servants: they cut one to pieces, <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> another, and killed another. Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. But last of all he sent unto them his only son, saying, Perchance they will reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and we shall possess his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When, therefore, the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto these husbandmen? They say unto him, He will miserably destroy these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their season.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014355"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;21:33-41</a></span> Again does the Lord say: <q>Have you never read, The stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore I say unto you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014356"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;21:42-44</a></span> By these words He clearly points out to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> one and the same Householder&mdash; that is, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who made all things by Himself; while [He shows] that there are various husbandmen, some obstinate, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and worthless, and slayers of the Lord, but others who render Him, with all <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, the fruits  in their seasons; and that it is the same Householder who sends at one time His servants, at another His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. From that Father, therefore, from whom the Son was sent to those husbandmen who slew Him, from Him also were the servants [sent]. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as coming from the Father with supreme authority (<em>principali auctoritate</em>), used to express Himself thus: <q>But I say unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014357"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> The servants, again, [who came] as from their Lord, spoke after the manner of servants, [delivering a message]; and they therefore used to say, <q>Thus says the Lord.</q></p>

<p>2. Whom these men did therefore preach to the unbelievers as Lord, Him did Christ teach to those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him; and the God who had called those of the former dispensation, is the same as He who has received those of the latter. In other words, He who at first used that law which entails bondage, is also He who did in after times [call His people] by means of adoption. For God planted the vineyard of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> when at the first He formed <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and chose the fathers; then He let it out to husbandmen when He established the Mosaic dispensation: He hedged it round about, that is, He gave particular instructions with regard to their worship: He built a tower, [that is], He chose Jerusalem: He dug a winepress, that is, He prepared a receptacle of the prophetic Spirit. And thus did He send <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> prior to the transmigration to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and after that event others again in greater number than the former, to seek the fruits, saying thus to them (the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>): <q>Thus says the Lord, Cleanse your ways and your doings, execute just judgment, and look each one with pity and compassion on his brother: oppress not the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> nor the orphan, the <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and let none of you treasure up <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against his brother in your hearts, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not false swearing. Wash you, make you clean, put away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from your hearts, learn to do well, seek judgment, protect the oppressed, judge the fatherless (<em>pupillo</em>), plead for the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>; and come, let us reason together, says the Lord.</q>  And again: <q>Keep your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips that they speak no guile; depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</q>  In preaching these things, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> sought the fruits of righteousness. But last of all He sent to those unbelievers His own Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> husbandmen cast out of the vineyard when they had slain Him. Wherefore the Lord God did even give it up (no longer hedged around, but thrown open throughout all the world) to other husbandmen, who render the fruits in their seasons&mdash;the beautiful elect tower being also raised everywhere. For the illustrious Church is [now] everywhere, and everywhere is the winepress dug: because those who do receive the Spirit are everywhere. For inasmuch as the former have rejected the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and cast Him out of the vineyard when they slew Him, God has <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> rejected them, and given to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> outside the vineyard the fruits of its cultivation. This is in accordance with what Jeremiah says, <q>The Lord has rejected and cast off the nation which does these things; for the children of Judah have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in my sight, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014360"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse29">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:29-30</a></span> And again in like manner does Jeremiah speak: <q>I set watchmen over you; hearken to the sound of the trumpet; and they said, We will not hearken. Therefore have the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> heard, and they who feed the flocks in them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014361"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse17">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:17-18</a></span> It is therefore one and the same Father who planted the vineyard, who led forth the people, who sent the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who sent His own Son, and who gave the vineyard to those other husbandmen that render the fruits in their season.</p>

<p>3. And therefore did the Lord say to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to make us become good workmen: <q>Take heed to yourselves, and watch continually upon every occasion, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and cares of this life, and that day shall come upon you unawares; for as a snare shall it come upon all dwelling upon the face of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014362"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;21:34-35</a></span> <q>Let your loins, therefore, be girded about, and your lights burning, and you like to men who wait for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014363"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;12:35-36</a></span> <q>For as it was in the days of Noe, they ate and drank, they bought and sold, they married and were given in marriage, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, until Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all; as also it was in the days of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, they ate and drank, they bought and sold, they planted and built, until the time that <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> went out of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>; it rained fire from heaven, and destroyed them all: so shall it also be at the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014364"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;17:26</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> <q>Watch therefore, for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not in what day your Lord shall come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014365"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;24:42</a></span> [In these passages] He declares one and the same Lord, who in the times of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> brought the deluge because of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> disobedience, and who also in the days of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> rained fire from heaven because of the multitude of sinners among the Sodomites, and who, on account of this same disobedience and similar <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, will bring on the day of judgment at the end of  time (<em>in novissimo</em>); on which day He declares that it shall be more tolerable for <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> than for that city and house which shall not receive the word of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. <q>And you, Capernaum,</q> He said, <q>is it that you shall be exalted to heaven?  You shall go down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. For if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, it would have remained unto this day. Verily I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in the day of judgment than for you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014367"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;11:23-24</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Since the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is always one and the same, He gives to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him a well of water <span class="stiki" id="note014368"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> [springing up] to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, but He causes the unfruitful fig-tree immediately to dry up; and in the days of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> He <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> brought on the deluge for the purpose of extinguishing that most <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> race of men then existent, who could not bring forth fruit to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> had commingled with them, and [acted as He did] in order that He might put a check upon the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of these men, but [that at the same time] He might preserve the archetype,  the formation of Adam. And it was He who rained fire and brimstone from heaven, in the days of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>, <q>an example of the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  that all may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, <q>that every tree that brings not forth good fruit shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014371"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> And it is He who uses [the words], that it will be more tolerable for <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in the general judgment than for those who beheld His wonders, and did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, nor receive His doctrine. <span class="stiki" id="note014372"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;11:24</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;10:12</a></span> For as He gave by His advent a greater privilege to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, and who do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so also did He point out that those who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him should have a more severe punishment in the judgment; thus extending equal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to all, and being to exact more from those to whom He gives the more; the more, however, not because He reveals the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of another Father, as I have shown so fully and so repeatedly, but because He has, by means of His advent, poured upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> the greater gift of paternal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>5. If, however, what I have stated be insufficient to convince any one that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were sent from one and the same Father, from whom also our Lord was sent, let such a one, opening the mouth of his heart, and calling upon the Master, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus the Lord</a>, listen to Him when He says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like a king who made a marriage for his son, and he sent forth his servants to call them who were bidden to the marriage.</q> And when they would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, He goes on to say, <q>Again he sent other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Come, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and all the fatlings are killed, and everything is ready; come unto the wedding. But they made light of it, and went their way, some to their farm, and others to their merchandize; but the remnant took his servants, and some they treated despitefully, while others they slew. But when the king heard this, he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and sent his armies and destroyed these murderers, and burned up their city, and said to his servants, The wedding is indeed ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. Go out therefore into the highways, and as many as you shall find, gather in to the marriage. So the servants went out, and collected together as many as they found, bad and good, and the wedding was furnished with guests. But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man not having on a wedding garment; and he said unto him, Friend, how did you come here, not having on a wedding garment? But he was speechless. Then said the king to his servants, Take him away, hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014373"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;22:1</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Now, by these words of His, does the Lord clearly show all [these points, viz.,] that there is one King and Lord, the Father of all, of whom He had previously said, <q>Neither shall you <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;</q>  and that He had from the beginning prepared the marriage for His Son, and used, with the utmost kindness, to call, by the instrumentality of His servants, the men of the former dispensation to the wedding feast; and when they would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, He still invited them by sending out other servants, yet that even then they did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him, but even <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> and slew those who brought them the message of invitation. He accordingly sent forth His armies and destroyed them, and burned down their city; but He called together from all the highways, that is, from all nations, [guests] to the marriage feast of His Son, as also He says by Jeremiah: <q>I have sent also unto you my servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to say, Return now, every man, from  his very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way, and amend your doings.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014375"><a href="../bible/jer035.htm#verse15">Jeremiah&nbsp;35:15</a></span> And again He says by the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>I have also sent unto you my servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> throughout the day and before the light; yet they did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me, nor incline their ears unto me. And you shall speak this word to them: This is a people that obeys not the voice of the Lord, nor receives correction; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has perished from their mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014376"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse25">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:25</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> The Lord, therefore, who has called us everywhere by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, is He who called those of old by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as appears by the words of the Lord; and although they preached to various nations, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were not from one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> from another; but, [proceeding] from one and the same, some of them announced the Lord, others preached the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and others again foretold the advent of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, while yet others declared Him as already present to those who then were afar off.</p>

<p>6. Still further did He also make it manifest, that we ought, after our calling, to be also adorned with works of righteousness, so that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> may rest upon us; for this is the wedding garment, of which also the apostle speaks, <q>Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up by <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014377"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:4</a></span> But those who have indeed been called to God's supper, yet have not received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> conduct <q>shall be,</q> He declares, <q>cast into outer darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014378"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;22:13</a></span> He thus clearly shows that the very same King who gathered from all quarters the faithful to the marriage of His Son, and who grants them the incorruptible banquet, [also] orders that man to be cast into outer darkness who has not on a wedding garment, that is, one who despises it. For as in the former covenant, <q>with many of them was He not well pleased;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014379"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:5</a></span> so also is it the case here, that <q>many are called, but few chosen.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014380"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;22:14</a></span> It is not, then, one God who judges, and another Father who calls us together to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; nor one, forsooth, who confers <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light, but another who orders those who have not on the wedding garment to be sent into outer darkness. But it is one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of our Lord, from whom also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had their mission, who does indeed, through His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> kindness, call the unworthy; but He examines those who are called, [to ascertain] if they have on the garment fit and proper for the marriage of His Son, because nothing unbecoming or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pleases Him. This is in accordance with what the Lord said to the man who had been healed: <q>Behold, you are made whole; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014381"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;5:14</a></span> For he who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and righteous, and pure, and spotless, will endure nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, nor detestable in His wedding chamber. This is the Father of our Lord, by whose <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> all things consist, and all are administered by His command; and He confers His free gifts upon those who should [receive them]; but the most righteous Retributor metes out [punishment] according to their deserts, most deservedly, to the ungrateful and to those that are insensible of His kindness; and therefore does He say, <q>He sent His armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014382"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;22:7</a></span> He says here, <q>His armies,</q> because all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are the property of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <q>the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein.</q>  Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says in the Epistle to the Romans, <q>For there is no power but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the powers that be are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whosoever resists the power, resists the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and they that resist shall receive unto themselves condemnation. For rulers are not for a terror to a good work, but to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Will you then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and you shall have praise of the same; for he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the avenger for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon him that does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore you must needs be subject, not only for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, but also for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> sake. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pay tribute also; for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014384"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;13:1-7</a></span> Both the Lord, then, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> announce as the one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Him who gave the law, who sent the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who made all things; and therefore does He say, <q>He sent His armies,</q> because every man, inasmuch as he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is His workmanship, although he may be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his God. For He gives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to all; He, <q>who makes His sun to rise upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good, and sends rain upon the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014385"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> </p>

<p>7. And not alone by what has been stated, but also by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the two sons, the younger of whom consumed his substance by living luxuriously with harlots, did the Lord teach one and the same Father, who did not even allow a kid to his elder son; but for him who had been lost, [namely] his younger son, he ordered the fatted calf to be killed, and he gave him the best robe. <span class="stiki" id="note014386"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;15:11</a></span>  Also by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the workmen who were sent into the vineyard at different periods of the day, one and the same God is declared <span class="stiki" id="note014387"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;20:1</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> as having called some in the beginning, when the world was first created; but others afterwards, and others during the intermediate period, others after a long lapse of time, and others again in the end of time; so that there are many workmen in their generations, but only one householder who calls them together. For there is but one vineyard, since there is also but one righteousness, and one dispensator, for there is one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> who arranges all things; and in like manner is there one hire, for they all received a penny each man, having [stamped upon it] the royal image and superscription, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. And therefore He began by giving the hire to those [who were engaged] last, because in the last times, when the Lord was revealed He presented Himself to all [as their reward].</p>

<p>8. Then, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, who excelled the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, [we find] that it was not because he worshipped another Father that he received testimony from the Lord that he was justified rather [than the other]; but because with great humility, apart from all boasting and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he made confession to the same God. <span class="stiki" id="note014388"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;18:10</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the two sons also: those who are sent into the vineyard, of whom one indeed opposed his father, but afterwards repented, when repentance profited him nothing; the other, however, promised to go, at once assuring his father, but he did not go (for <q>every man is a liar;</q>  <q>to will is present with him, but he finds not means to perform</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014390"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span>)&mdash;[this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, I say], points out one and the same Father. Then, again, this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was clearly shown forth by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the fig-tree, of which the Lord says, <q>Behold, now these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, but I find none</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014391"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;13:6</a></span> (pointing onwards, by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, to His advent, by whom He came from time to time, seeking the fruit of righteousness from them, which he did not find), and also by the circumstance that, for the reason already mentioned, the fig-tree should be hewn down. And, without using a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, the Lord said to Jerusalem, <q>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> those that are sent unto you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house shall be left unto you desolate.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014392"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;13:34</a>; <a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;23:37</a></span> For that which had been said in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, <q>Behold, for three years I come seeking fruit,</q> and in clear terms, again, [where He says], <q>How often would I have gathered your children together,</q> shall be [found] a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, if we do not understand His advent, which is [announced] by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; if, in fact, He came to them but once, and then for the first time. But since He who chose the patriarchs and those [who lived under the first covenant], is the same <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> who did both visit them through the prophetic Spirit, and us also who have been called together from all quarters by His advent; in addition to what has been already said, He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> declared, <q>Many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall recline with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. But the children of the kingdom shall go into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014393"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;8:11-12</a></span> If, then, those who do <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him through the preaching of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> throughout the east and west shall recline with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, partaking with them of the [heavenly] banquet, one and the same God is set forth as He who did indeed choose the patriarchs, visited also the people, and called the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>
