<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 38)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Why man was not made perfect from the beginning. </span>

<p>1. If, however, any one say, <q>What then? Could not God have exhibited man as perfect from beginning?</q> let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, inasmuch as God is indeed always the same and unbegotten as respects Himself, all things are possible to Him. But <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things must be inferior to Him who created them, from the very fact of their later origin; for it was not possible for things recently created to have been uncreated. But inasmuch as they are not uncreated, for this very reason do they come short of the perfect. Because, as these things are of later date, so are they infantile; so are they unaccustomed to, and unexercised in, perfect discipline. For as it certainly is in the power of a mother to give strong food to her infant, [but she does not do so], as the child is not yet able to receive more substantial nourishment; so also it was possible for God Himself to have made man perfect from the first, but man could not receive this [perfection], being as yet an infant. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> our Lord in these last times, when He had summed up all things into Himself, came to us, not as He might have come, but as we were capable of beholding Him. He might easily have come to us in His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but in that case we could never have endured the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and therefore it was that He, who was the perfect bread of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, offered Himself to us as milk, [because we were] as infants. He did this when He appeared as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that we, being nourished, as it were, from the breast of His flesh, and having, by such a course of milk nourishment, become accustomed to eat and drink the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, may be able also to contain in ourselves the Bread of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which is the Spirit of the Father.</p>

<p>2. And on this account does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declare to the Corinthians, <q>I have fed you with milk, not with meat, for hitherto you were not able to bear it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014417"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> That is, you have indeed learned the advent of our Lord as a man; nevertheless, because of your infirmity, the Spirit of the Father has not as yet rested upon you. <q>For when envying and strife,</q> he says, <q>and dissensions are among you, are you not carnal, and walk as men?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014418"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> That is, that the Spirit of the Father was not yet with them, on account of their imperfection and shortcomings of their walk in life. As, therefore, the apostle had the power to give them strong meat&mdash; for those upon whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> laid hands received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who is the food of life [<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>] &mdash; but they were not capable of receiving it, because they had the sentient faculties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> still feeble and undisciplined in the practice of things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so, in like manner, God had power at the beginning to grant perfection to man; but as the latter was only recently created, he could not possibly have received it, or even if he had received it, could he have contained it, or containing it, could he have retained it. It was for this reason that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, although He was perfect, passed through the state of infancy in common with the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, partaking of it thus not for His own benefit, but for that of the infantile stage of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, in order that man might be able to receive Him. There was nothing, therefore, impossible to and deficient in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, [implied in the fact] that man was not an uncreated being; but this merely applied to him who was lately created, [namely] man.</p>

<p>3. With God there are simultaneously exhibited power, wisdom, and goodness. His power and goodness [appear] in this, that of His own will He called into being and fashioned things having no previous <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; His wisdom [is shown] in His having made <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things parts of one harmonious and consistent whole; and those things which, through His super-eminent kindness, receive growth and a long period of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, do reflect the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the uncreated One, of that God who bestows what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> ungrudgingly. For from the very fact of these things having been created, [it follows] that they are not uncreated; but by their continuing in being throughout a long course of ages, they shall receive a faculty of the Uncreated, through the gratuitous bestowal of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> upon them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus in all things God has the pre-eminence, who alone is uncreated, the first of all things, and the primary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of all, while all other things remain under God's subjection. But being in subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is continuance in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the uncreated One. By this arrangement, therefore, and these harmonies, and a sequence of this nature, man, a created and organized being, is rendered after the image and likeness of the uncreated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;the Father planning everything well and giving His commands, the Son carrying these into execution  and performing the work of creating, and the Spirit nourishing and increasing [what is made], but man making progress day by day, and ascending towards the perfect, that is, approximating to the uncreated One. For the Uncreated is perfect, that is, God. Now it was necessary that man should in the first instance be created; and having been created, should receive growth; and having received growth, should be strengthened; and having been strengthened, should abound; and having abounded, should recover [from the disease of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>]; and having recovered, should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; and being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, should see his Lord. For God is He who is yet to be seen, and the beholding of God is productive of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, but <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> renders one near unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>4. Irrational, therefore, in every respect, are they who await not the time of increase, but ascribe to God the infirmity of their nature. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> neither God nor themselves, being insatiable and ungrateful, unwilling to be at the outset what they have also been created&mdash; men subject to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; but go beyond the law of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and before that they become men, they wish to be even now like God their Creator, and they who are more destitute of reason than dumb animals [insist] that there is no distinction between the uncreated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a creature of today. For these, [the dumb animals], bring no charge against God for not having made them men; but each one, just as he has been created, gives thanks that he has been created. For we cast blame upon Him, because we have not been made gods from the beginning, but at first merely men, then at length gods; although God has adopted this course out of His pure benevolence, that no one may impute to Him invidiousness or grudgingness. He declares, <q>I have said, You are gods; and you are all sons of the Highest.</q>  But since we could not sustain the power of divinity, He adds, <q>But you shall die like men,</q> setting forth both truths&mdash; the kindness of His free gift, and our weakness, and also that we were possessed of power over ourselves. For after His great kindness He graciously conferred good [upon us], and made men like to Himself, [that is] in their own power; while at the same time by His prescience He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the infirmity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, and the consequences which would flow from it; but through [His] <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and [His] power, He shall overcome the substance of created nature.  For it was necessary, at first, that nature should be exhibited; then, after that, that what was mortal should be conquered and swallowed up by <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and the corruptible by incorruptibility, and that man should be made after the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>
