<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 39)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Man is endowed with the faculty of distinguishing good and evil; so that, without compulsion, he has the power, by his own will and choice, to perform God's commandments, by doing which he avoids the evils prepared for the rebellious.</span>

<p>1. Man has received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and to keep His commandment, and this is the life of man; as not to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> God is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and this is his death. Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, gave [to man] such mental power (<em>magnanimitatem</em>) man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> both the good of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of disobedience, that the eye of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, receiving experience of both, may with judgment make choice of the better things; and that he may never become indolent or neglectful of God's command; and learning by experience that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing which deprives him of life, that is, disobedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may never attempt it at all, but that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that what preserves his life, namely, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, he may diligently keep it with all earnestness. Wherefore he has also had a twofold experience, possessing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of both kinds, that with discipline he may make choice of the better things. But how, if he had no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the contrary, could he have had instruction in that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? For there is thus a surer and an undoubted comprehension of matters submitted to us than the mere surmise arising from an opinion regarding them. For just as the tongue receives experience of sweet and bitter by means of tasting, and the eye discriminates between black and white by means of vision, and the ear recognises the distinctions of sounds by hearing; so also does the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, receiving through the experience of both the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, become more tenacious of its preservation, by acting in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to God: in the first place, casting away, by means of repentance, disobedience, as being something disagreeable and nauseous; and afterwards coming to understand what it really is, that it is contrary to goodness and sweetness, so that the mind may never even attempt to taste disobedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if any one do shun the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of both these kinds of things, and the twofold perception of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he unawares divests himself of the character of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being.</p>

<p>2. How, then, shall he be a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has not as yet been made a man? Or how can he be perfect who was but lately created? How, again, can he be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, who in his mortal nature  did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> his Maker? For it must be that you, at the outset, should hold the rank of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and then afterwards partake of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For you did not make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but God you. If, then, you are God's workmanship, await the hand of your Maker which creates everything in due time; in due time as far as you are concerned, whose creation is being carried out.  Offer to Him your heart in a soft and tractable state, and preserve the form in which the Creator has fashioned you, having moisture in yourself, lest, by becoming hardened, you lose the impressions of His fingers. But by preserving the framework you shall ascend to that which is perfect, for the moist clay which is in you is hidden [there] by the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. His hand fashioned your substance; He will cover you over [too] within and without with pure gold and silver, and He will adorn you to such a degree, that even <q>the King Himself shall have pleasure in your beauty.</q>  But if you, being obstinately hardened, reject the operation of His skill, and show yourself ungrateful towards Him, because you were created a [mere] man, by becoming thus ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have at once lost both His workmanship and life. For creation is an attribute of the goodness of God but to be created is that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. If then, you shall deliver up to Him what is yours, that is, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards Him and subjection, you shall receive His handiwork, and shall be a perfect work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>3. If, however, you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and will flee from His hands, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of imperfection shall be in you who did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, but not in Him who called [you]. For He commissioned [messengers] to call people to the marriage, but they who did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him deprived themselves of the royal supper. <span class="stiki" id="note014423"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;22:3</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> The skill of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, is not defective, for He has power of the stones to raise up children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note014424"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;3:9</a></span> but the man who does not obtain it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to himself of his own imperfection. Nor, [in like manner], does the light fail because of those who have blinded themselves; but while it remains the same as ever, those who are [thus] blinded are involved in darkness through their own fault. The light does never enslave any one by necessity; nor, again, does God exercise compulsion upon any one unwilling to accept the exercise of His skill. Those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore, who have <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> from the light given by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and transgressed the law of liberty, have done so through their own fault, since they have been created free agents, and possessed of power over themselves.</p>

<p>4. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, foreknowing all things, prepared fit habitations for both, kindly conferring that light which they desire on those who seek after the light of incorruption, and resort to it; but for the despisers and mockers who avoid and turn themselves away from this light, and who do, as it were, blind themselves, He has prepared darkness suitable to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who oppose the light, and He has inflicted an appropriate punishment upon those who try to avoid being subject to Him. Submission to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest, so that they who shun the light have a place worthy of their flight; and those who fly from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest, have a habitation in accordance with their fleeing. Now, since all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they who by their own determination fly from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do defraud themselves of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; and having been [thus] defrauded of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things with respect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they shall consequently fall under the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who shun rest shall <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> incur punishment, and those who avoid the light shall <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> dwell in darkness. For as in the case of this temporal light, those who shun it do deliver themselves over to darkness, so that they do themselves become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to themselves that they are destitute of light, and do inhabit darkness; and, as I have already observed, the light is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such an [unhappy] condition of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to them; so those who fly from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which contains in itself all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, are themselves the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to themselves of their inhabiting <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> darkness, destitute of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, having become to themselves the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of [their consignment to] an abode of that nature.</p>
