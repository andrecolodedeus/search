<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 40)</h1>

<span class="h1a">One and the same God the Father inflicts punishment on the reprobate, and bestows rewards on the elect.</span>

<p>1. It is therefore one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father who has prepared <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things with Himself for those who desire His fellowship, and who remain in subjection to Him; and who has the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> for the ringleader of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and those who revolted with him, into which [fire] the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note014425"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> has declared those men shall be sent who have been set apart by themselves on His left hand. And this is what has been spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>I am a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, making peace, and creating <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014426"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;45:7</a></span> thus making peace and friendship with those who repent and turn to Him, and bringing [them to] unity, but preparing for the impenitent, those who shun the light, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> and outer darkness, which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> indeed to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who fall into them.</p>

<p>  2. If, however, it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> one Father who confers rest, and another God who has prepared the fire, their sons would have been equally different [one from the other]; one, indeed, sending [men] into the Father's kingdom, but the other into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>. But inasmuch as one and the same Lord has pointed out that the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> shall be divided at the judgment, <q>as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014427"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;25:32</a></span> and that to some He will say, <q>Come, you blessed of My Father, receive the kingdom which has been prepared for you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014428"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a></span> but to others, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, which My Father has prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014429"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> one and the same Father is manifestly declared [in this passage], <q>making peace and creating <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things,</q> preparing fit things for both; as also there is one Judge sending both into a fit place, as the Lord sets forth in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the tares and the wheat, where He says, <q>As therefore the tares are gathered together, and burned in the fire, so shall it be at the end of the world. The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall send His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and they shall gather from His kingdom everything that offends, and those who work iniquity, and shall send them into a furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the just shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014430"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;13:40-43</a></span> The Father, therefore, who has prepared the kingdom for the righteous, into which the Son has received those worthy of it, is He who has also prepared the furnace of fire, into which these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall send those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who deserve it, according to God's command.</p>

<p>3. The Lord, indeed, sowed good seed in His own field;  and He says, <q>The field is the world.</q> But while men slept, the enemy came, and <q>sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went his way.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014432"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;13:28</a></span> Hence we learn that this was the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and the enemy, because he was <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of God's workmanship, and took in hand to render this [workmanship] an enmity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also God has banished from His presence him who did of his own accord stealthily sow the tares, that is, him who brought about the transgression;  but He took compassion upon man, who, through want of care no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but still wickedly [on the part of another], became involved in disobedience; and He turned the enmity by which [the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>] had designed to make [man] the enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, against the author of it, by removing His own <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> from man, turning it in another direction, and sending it instead upon the serpent. As also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells us that God said to the serpent, <q>And I will place enmity between you and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and between your seed and her seed. He  shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014435"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;3:15</a></span> And the Lord summed up in Himself this enmity, when He was made man from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and trod upon his [the serpent's] head, as I have pointed out in the preceding book.</p>
