<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 41)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Those persons who do not believe in God, but who are disobedient, are angels and sons of the devil, not indeed by nature, but by imitation. Close of this book, and scope of the succeeding one.</span>

<p>1. Inasmuch as the Lord has said that there are certain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, [viz. those] of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, for whom <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> is prepared; and as, again, He declares with regard to the tares, <q>The tares are the children of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014436"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;13:38</a></span> it must be affirmed that He has ascribed all who are of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> to him who is the ringleader of this transgression. But He made neither <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> nor men so by nature. For we do not find that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> created anything whatsoever, since indeed he is himself a creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For God made all things, as also David says with regard to all things of the kind: <q>For He spoke the word, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.</q> </p>

<p>2. Since, therefore, all things were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> to himself and others, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> does the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> always term those who remain in a state of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> <q>sons of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></q> and <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one</q> (<em>maligni</em>). For [the word] <q>son,</q> as one before me has observed, has a twofold meaning: one [is a son] in the order of nature, because he was born a son; the other, in that he was made so, is reputed a son, although there be a difference between being born so and being made so. For the first is indeed born from the person referred to; but the second is made so by him, whether as respects his creation or by the teaching of his doctrine. For when any person has been taught from the mouth of another, he is termed the son of him who instructs him, and the latter [is called] his father. According to nature, then&mdash; that is, according to creation, so to speak&mdash; we are all sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because we have all been created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But with respect to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>  and doctrine we are not all the sons of God: those only are so who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him and do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and do not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, are sons and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, because they do the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And that such is the case He has declared in Isaiah: <q>I have begotten and brought up children, but they have rebelled against Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014438"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;1:2</a></span> And again, where He says that these children are aliens: <q>Strange children have lied unto Me.</q>  According to nature, then, they are [His] children, because they have been so created; but with regard to their works, they are not His children.</p>

<p>3. For as, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, those sons who disobey their fathers, being disinherited, are still their sons in the course of nature, but by law are disinherited, for they do not become the heirs of their natural <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; so in the same way is it with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;those who do not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him being disinherited by Him, have ceased to be His sons. Wherefore they cannot receive His inheritance: as David says, <q>Sinners are alienated from the womb; their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is after the likeness of a serpent.</q>  And therefore did the Lord term those whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be the offspring of men <q>a generation of vipers;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014441"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;23:33</a></span> because after the manner of these animals they go about in subtlety, and injure others. For He said, <q>Beware of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014442"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;16:6</a></span> Speaking of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, too, He says, <q>Go and tell that fox,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014443"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;13:32</a></span> aiming at his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> cunning and deceit. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David says, <q>Man, being placed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, is made like cattle.</q>  And again Jeremiah says, <q>They have become like horses, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> about <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>; each one neighed after his neighbour's wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014445"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:8</a></span> And Isaiah, when preaching in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and reasoning with <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, termed them <q>rulers of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a></q> and <q>people of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014446"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;1:10</a></span> intimating that they were like the Sodomites in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and that the same description of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was rife among them, calling them by the same name, because of the similarity of their conduct. And inasmuch as they were not by nature so created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but had power also to act rightly, the same person said to them, giving them good counsel, <q>Wash, make you clean; take away iniquity from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> before my eyes; cease from your iniquities.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014447"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;1:16</a></span> Thus, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, since they had transgressed and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the same manner, so did they receive the same reproof as did the Sodomites. But when they should be converted and come to repentance, and cease from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they should have power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which is given by Him. For this reason, therefore, He has termed those <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> and <q>children of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014448"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;13:38</a></span> who give heed to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and do his works. But these are, at the same time, all created by the one and the same God. When, however, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and are subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and go on and keep His doctrine, they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but when they have <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> and fallen into transgression, they are ascribed to their chief, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash; to him who first became the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> to himself, and afterwards to others.</p>

<p>4. Inasmuch as the words of the Lord are numerous, while they all proclaim one and the same Father, the Creator of this world, it was incumbent also upon me, for their own sake, to refute by many [arguments] those who are involved in many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, if by any means, when they are confuted by many [<a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>], they may be converted to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and saved. But it is necessary to subjoin to this composition, in what follows, also the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> after the words of the Lord, to examine the opinion of this man, and expound the apostle, and to explain whatsoever [passages] have received other interpretations from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who have altogether misunderstood what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has spoken, and to point out the folly of their mad opinions; and to demonstrate from that same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, from whose [writings] they press questions upon us, that they are indeed utterers of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, but that the apostle was a preacher of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that he taught all things agreeable to the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; [to the effect that] it was one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father who spoke with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who gave the law, who sent the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> beforehand, who in the last times sent His Son, and conferred <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> upon His own handiwork &mdash; that is, the substance of flesh. Arranging, then, in another book, the rest of the words of the Lord, which He taught concerning the Father not by <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, but by expressions taken in their obvious meaning (<em>sed simpliciter ipsis dictionibus</em>), and the exposition of the Epistles of the blessed apostle, I shall, with God's aid, furnish you with the complete work of the exposure and refutation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called; thus practising myself and you in [these] five books for presenting opposition to all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>
