<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 5)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The author returns to his former argument, and shows that there was but one God announced by the law and prophets, whom Christ confesses as His Father, and who, through His word, one living God with Him, made Himself known to men in both covenants.</span>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, is one and the same, who rolls up the heaven as a book, and renews the face of the earth; who made the things of time for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that coming to maturity in them, he may produce the fruit of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and who, through His kindness, also bestows [upon him] <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, <q>that in the ages to come He may show the exceeding riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013843"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse7">Ephesians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> who was announced by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, whom Christ confessed as His Father. Now He is the Creator, and He it is who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all, as Esaias says, <q>I am <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and understand that I am. Before me there was no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither shall be after me. I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and besides me there is no Saviour. I have proclaimed, and I have saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013844"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;43:10</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And again: <q>I myself am the first <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I am above things to come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013845"><a href="../bible/isa012.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;12:4</a></span> For neither in an ambiguous, nor arrogant, nor boastful manner, does He say these things; but since it was impossible, without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to come to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He teaches men, through His Word, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. To those, therefore, who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these matters, and on this account <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they have discovered another Father, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> does one say, <q>You do <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013846"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;22:29</a></span> </p>

<p>2. For our Lord and Master, in the answer which He gave to the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who say that there is no resurrection, and who do therefore  dishonour <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and lower the credit of the law, did both indicate a resurrection, and reveal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying to them, <q>You do <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>For, touching the resurrection of the dead,</q> He says, <q>have you not read that which was spoken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob?</q>  And He added, <q>He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead, but of the living; for all live to Him.</q> By these arguments He unquestionably made it clear, that He who spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> out of the bush, and declared Himself to be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the fathers, He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the living. For who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the living unless He who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and above whom there is no other God? Whom also Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, when Cyrus king of the Persians said to him, <q>Why do you not worship Bel?</q>  did proclaim, saying, <q>Because I do not worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> made with hands, but the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who established the heaven and the earth and has dominion over all flesh.</q> Again did he say, <q>I will adore the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He is the living God.</q> He, then, who was adored by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the living; and His Word is He who also spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who also put the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> to silence, who also bestowed the gift of resurrection, thus revealing [both] truths to those who are blind, that is, the resurrection and God [in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character]. For if He be not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead, but of the living, yet was called the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the fathers who were sleeping, they do indubitably live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have not passed out of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, since they are children of the resurrection. But our Lord is Himself the resurrection, as He does Himself declare, <q>I am the resurrection and the life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013849"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;11:25</a></span> But the fathers are His children; for it is said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Instead of your fathers, your children have been made to you.</q>  Christ Himself, therefore, together with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the living, who spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and who was also manifested to the fathers.</p>

<p>3. And teaching this very thing, He said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>Your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced that he should see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013851"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a></span> What is intended? <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013852"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;4:3</a></span> In the first place, [he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>] that He was the maker of heaven and earth, the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in the next place, that He would make his seed as the stars of heaven. This is what is meant by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, [when he says,] <q>as lights in the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013853"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> Righteously, therefore, having left his earthly kindred, he followed the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, walking as a pilgrim with the Word, that he might [afterwards] have his abode with the Word.</p>

<p>4. Righteously also the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, being of the race of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, left the ship and their father, and followed the Word. Righteously also do we, possessing the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and taking up the cross as Isaac did the wood, <span class="stiki" id="note013854"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;22:6</a></span> follow Him. For in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> man had learned beforehand, and had been accustomed to follow the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, according to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, followed the command of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and with a ready mind delivered up, as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his only-begotten and beloved son, in order that God also might be pleased to offer up for all his seed His own beloved and only-begotten Son, as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for our redemption.</p>

<p>5. Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and saw in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> the day of the Lord's coming, and the dispensation of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a>, through whom both he himself and all who, following the example of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should be saved, he rejoiced exceedingly. The Lord, therefore, was not unknown to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, whose day he desired to see; <span class="stiki" id="note013855"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a></span> nor, again, was the Lord's Father, for he had learned from the Word of the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him; wherefore it was accounted to him by the Lord for righteousness. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards God justifies a man; and therefore he said, <q>I will stretch forth my hand to the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made the heaven and the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013856"><a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;14:22</a></span> All these truths, however, do those holding perverse opinions endeavour to overthrow, because of one passage, which they certainly do not understand correctly.</p>
