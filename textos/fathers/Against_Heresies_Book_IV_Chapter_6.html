<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 6)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Explanation of the words of Christ, <q>No man knows the Father, but the Son,</q> etc.; which words the heretics misinterpret. Proof that, by the Father revealing the Son, and by the Son being revealed, the Father was never unknown.</span>

<p>1. For the Lord, revealing Himself to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that He Himself is the Word, who imparts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and reproving the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who imagined that they, had [the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of] <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while they nevertheless rejected His Word, through whom God is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, declared, <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father; neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any man the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whom the Son has willed to reveal [Him].</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013857"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> Thus has Matthew set it  down, and Luke in like manner, and Mark  the very same; for John omits this passage. They, however, who would be wiser than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, write [the verse] in the following manner: <q>No man <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a></em> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the Son; nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and he to whom the Son has willed to reveal [Him];</q> and they explain it as if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to none prior to our Lord's advent; and that God who was announced by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, they allege not to be the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>2. But if Christ did then [only] begin to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> when He came [into the world] as man, and [if] the Father did remember [only] in the times of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a> to provide for [the wants of] men, and His Word was shown to have not always coexisted with His creatures; [it may be remarked that] neither then was it necessary that another God should be proclaimed, but [rather] that the reasons for so great carelessness and neglect on His part should be made the subject of investigation. For it is fitting that no such question should arise, and gather such strength, that it would indeed both change <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and destroy our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in that Creator who supports us by means of His creation. For as we do direct our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, so also should we possess a firm and immoveable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards the Father. In his book against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>  does well say: <q>I would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the Lord Himself, if He had announced any other than He who is our framer, maker, and nourisher. But because the only-begotten Son came to us from the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who both made this world and formed us, and contains and administers all things, summing up His own handiwork in Himself, my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards Him is steadfast, and my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the Father immoveable, God bestowing both upon us.</q></p>

<p>3. For no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, unless through the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, that is, unless by the Son revealing [Him]; neither can he have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, unless through the good pleasure of the Father. But the Son performs the good pleasure of the Father; for the Father sends, and the Son is sent, and comes. And His Word <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that His Father is, as far as regards us, invisible and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; and since He cannot be declared [by any one else], He does Himself declare Him to us; and, on the other hand, it is the Father alone who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> His own Word. And both these truths has our Lord declared. Wherefore the Son reveals the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father through His own manifestation. For the manifestation of the Son is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father; for all things are manifested through the Word. In order, therefore, that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Son who came is He who imparts to those believing on Him a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>:  <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the Father but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and those to whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him;</q> thus setting Himself forth and the Father as He [really] is, that we may not receive any other Father, except Him who is revealed by the Son.</p>

<p>4. But this [Father] is the Maker of heaven and earth, as is shown from His words; and not he, the false father, who has been invented by <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, or by <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, or by <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, or by Carpocrates, or by Simon, or by the rest of the <q><a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>,</q> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called. For none of these was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a> [was], against whom they set their teaching in opposition, and have the daring to preach an unknown God. But they ought to hear [this] against themselves: How is it that He is unknown, who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by them? For, whatever is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> even by a few, is not unknown. But the Lord did not say that both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> could not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at all (<em>in totum</em>), for in that case His advent would have been superfluous. For why did He come hither? Was it that He should say to us, <q>Never mind seeking after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He is unknown, and you shall not find Him;</q> as also the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> declare that Christ said to their <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>? But this is indeed vain. For the Lord taught us that no man is capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless he be taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that is, that God cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> without God: but that this is the express will of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>  Him to whomsoever the Son has revealed Him.</p>

<p>5. And for this purpose did the Father reveal the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that through His instrumentality He might be manifested to all, and might receive those righteous ones who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him into incorruption and everlasting enjoyment (now, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him is to do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>); but He shall righteously shut out into the darkness which they have chosen for themselves, those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and who do consequently avoid His light. The Father therefore has revealed Himself to all, by making His Word visible to all; and, conversely, the Word has declared to all the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since He has become visible to all. And therefore the righteous <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> [shall fall] upon all who, like  others, have seen, but have not, like others, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>6. For by means of the creation itself, the Word reveals God the Creator; and by means of the world [does He declare] the Lord the Maker of the world; and by means of the formation [of man] the Artificer who formed him; and by the Son that Father who begot the Son: and these things do indeed address all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the same manner, but all do not in the same way <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them. But by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> did the Word preach both Himself and the Father alike [to all]; and all the people heard Him alike, but all did not alike <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And through the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself who had been made visible and palpable, was the Father shown forth, although all did not equally <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him; but all saw the Father in the Son: for the Father is the invisible of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Son the visible of the Father. And for this reason all spoke with Christ when He was present [upon earth], and they named Him God. Yea, even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> exclaimed, on beholding the Son: <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You who You are, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013862"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;1:24</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> looking at Him, and tempting Him, said: <q>If You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013863"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;4:3</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;4:3</a></span> &mdash; all thus indeed seeing and speaking of the Son and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but all not believing [in them].</p>

<p>7. For it was fitting that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should receive testimony from all, and should become [a means of] judgment for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> indeed of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but for the condemnation of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not; that all should be fairly judged, and that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Father and Son should be approved by all, that is, that it should be established by all [as the one means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>], receiving testimony from all, both from those belonging to it, since they are its friends, and by those having no connection with it, though they are its enemies. For that evidence is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and cannot be gainsaid, which elicits even from its adversaries striking  testimonies in its behalf; they being convinced with respect to the matter in hand by their own plain <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of it, and bearing testimony to it, as well as declaring it.  But after a while they break forth into enmity, and become accusers [of what they had approved], and are desirous that their own testimony should not be [regarded as] <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. He, therefore, who was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, was not a different being from Him who declared <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> but one and the same, the Father making all things subject to Him; while He received testimony from all that He was very man, and that He was very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, from <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, from the creation itself, from men, from <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> spirits and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, from the enemy, and last of all, from death itself. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, administering all things for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, works from the beginning even to the end, and without Him no man can attain the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the Son is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father; but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Son is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has been revealed through the Son; and this was the reason why the Lord declared: <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father; nor the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and those to whomsoever the Son shall reveal [Him].</q>  For <q>shall reveal</q> was said not with reference to the future alone, as if then [only] the Word had begun to manifest the Father when He was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, but it applies indifferently throughout all time. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, being present with His own handiwork from the beginning, reveals the Father to all; to whom He wills, and when He wills, and as the Father wills. Wherefore, then, in all things, and through all things, there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and one Word, and one Son, and one Spirit, and one <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</p>
