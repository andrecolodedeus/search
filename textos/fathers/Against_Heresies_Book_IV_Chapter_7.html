<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 7)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Recapitulation of the foregoing argument, showing that Abraham, through the revelation of the Word, knew the Father, and the coming of the Son of God. For this cause, he rejoiced to see the day of Christ, when the promises made to him should be fulfilled. The fruit of this rejoicing has flowed to posterity, viz., to those who are partakers in the faith of Abraham, but not to the Jews who reject the Word of God.</span>

<p>1. Therefore <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> also, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the Father through the Word, who made heaven and earth, confessed Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and having learned, by an announcement [made to him], that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> would be a man among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by whose advent his seed should be as the stars of heaven, he desired to see that day, so that he might himself also embrace Christ; and, seeing it through the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, he rejoiced. <span class="stiki" id="note013867"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;17:17</a></span> Wherefore Simeon also, one of his descendants, carried fully out the rejoicing of the patriarch, and said: <q>Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace. For my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which You have prepared  before the face of all people: a light for the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,  and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013869"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;2:29</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in like manner, announced tidings of great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the shepherds who were keeping watch by night. <span class="stiki" id="note013870"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Moreover, Mary said, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013871"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;1:46</a></span> &mdash; the rejoicing of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> descending upon those who sprang from him&mdash;those, namely, who were watching, and who beheld Christ, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him; while, on the other hand, there was a reciprocal rejoicing which passed backwards from the children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who did also desire to see the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming. Rightly, then, did our Lord bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to him, saying, <q>Your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</q></p>

<p>2. For not alone upon <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> account did He say these things, but also that He might point out how all who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> God from the beginning, and have foretold the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have received the revelation from the Son Himself; who also in the last times was made visible and passible, and spoke with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, that He might from the stones raise up children unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and fulfil the promise which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had given him, and that He might make his seed as the stars of heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note013872"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;15:5</a></span> as John the Baptist says: <q>For God is able from these stones to raise up children unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013873"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;3:9</a></span> Now, this Jesus did by drawing us off from the religion of stones, and bringing us over from hard and fruitless cogitations, and establishing in us a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> like to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does also testify, saying that we are children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> because of the similarity of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the promise of inheritance. <span class="stiki" id="note013874"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;4:12</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse28">Galatians&nbsp;4:28</a></span> </p>

<p>3. He is therefore one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and gave him the promise. But He is the Creator, who does also through Christ prepare lights in the world, [namely] those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And He says, <q>You are the light of the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013875"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;5:14</a></span> that is, as the stars of heaven. Him, therefore, I have rightly shown to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by no man, unless by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and to whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him. But the Son reveals the Father to all to whom He wills that He should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and neither without the goodwill of the Father nor without the agency of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, can any man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. Wherefore did the Lord say to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>I am the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life and no man comes unto the Father but by Me. If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, you would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> My Father also: and from henceforth you have both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, and have seen Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013876"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6-7</a></span> From these words it is evident, that He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that is, by the Word.</p>

<p>4. Therefore have the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> departed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in not receiving His Word, but imagining that they could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father [apart] by Himself, without the Word, that is, without the Son; they being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of that God who spoke in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shape to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note013877"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;18:1</a></span> and again to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, <q>I have surely seen the affliction of My people in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and I have come down to deliver them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013878"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;3:7-8</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, arranged these things beforehand from the beginning, the Father being in no want of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in order that He might call the creation into being, and form man, for whom also the creation was made; nor, again, standing in need of any instrumentality for the framing of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, or for the ordering of those things which had reference to man; while, [at the same time,] He has a vast and unspeakable number of servants. For His <em>offspring</em> and His <em>similitude</em>  do minister to Him in every respect; that is, the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the Word and Wisdom; whom all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> serve, and to whom they are subject. Vain, therefore, are those who, because of that declaration, <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013880"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> do introduce another unknown Father.</p>
