<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Chapter 8)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Vain attempts of Marcion and his followers, who exclude Abraham from the salvation bestowed by Christ, who liberated not only Abraham, but the seed of Abraham, by fulfilling and not destroying the law when He healed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>.</span>

<p>1. Vain, too, is [the effort of] <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and his followers when they [seek to] exclude <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> from the inheritance, to whom the Spirit through many men, and now by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that <q>he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013881"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;4:3</a></span> And the Lord [also bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to him,] in the first place, indeed, by raising up children to him from the stones, and making his seed as the stars of heaven, saying, <q>They shall come from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south, and shall recline with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013882"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;8:11</a></span> and then again by saying to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>When you shall see <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, but you  yourselves cast out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013883"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;13:28</a></span> This, then, is a clear point, that those who disallow his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and frame the idea of another God besides Him who made the promise to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, are outside the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and are disinherited from [the gift of] incorruption, setting at naught and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who introduces, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and his seed, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, upon which also is conferred the adoption and the inheritance promised to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</p>

<p>2. For the Lord vindicated <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> posterity by loosing them from bondage and calling them to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as He did in the case of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom He healed, saying openly to those who had not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> like <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <q>You hypocrites,  does not each one of you on the Sabbath-days loose his ox or his ass, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, being a daughter of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has bound these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath-days?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013885"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;13:15-16</a></span> It is clear therefore, that He loosed and vivified those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> did, doing nothing contrary to the law when He healed upon the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. For the law did not prohibit men from being healed upon the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>; [on the contrary,] it even <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> them upon that day, and gave command that the offices should be performed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the people; yea, it did not disallow the healing even of dumb animals. Both at Siloam and on frequent subsequent  occasions, did He perform cures upon the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>; and for this reason many used to resort to Him on the Sabbath-days. For the law commanded them to abstain from every servile work, that is, from all grasping after <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which is procured by trading and by other worldly business; but it exhorted them to attend to the exercises of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which consist in reflection, and to addresses of a beneficial kind for their neighbours' benefit. And therefore the Lord reproved those who <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> blamed Him for having healed upon the Sabbath-days. For He did not make void, but fulfilled the law, by performing the offices of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, propitiating God for men, and cleansing the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, healing the sick, and Himself suffering death, that exiled man might go forth from condemnation, and might return without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to his own inheritance.</p>

<p>3. And again, the law did not forbid those who were hungry on the Sabbath-days to take food lying ready at hand: it did, however, forbid them to reap and to gather into the barn. And therefore did the Lord say to those who were blaming His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> because they plucked and ate the ears of grain, rubbing them in their hands, <q>Have you not read this, what David did, when himself was an hungered; how he went into the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and ate the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a>, and gave to those who were with him; which it is not lawful to eat, but for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> alone?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013887"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;6:3-4</a></span> justifying His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> by the words of the law, and pointing out that it was lawful for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to act freely. For David had been appointed a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although Saul <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him. For all the righteous possess the sacerdotal rank.  And all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of the Lord are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who do inherit here neither lands nor houses, but serve God and the altar continually. Of whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also says in Deuteronomy, when blessing Levi, <q>Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> you; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, and he disinherited his own sons: he kept Your commandments, and observed Your covenant.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013889"><a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy&nbsp;33:9</a></span> But who are they that have left father and mother, and have said adieu to all their neighbours, on account of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His covenant, unless the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord? Of whom again <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, <q>They shall have no inheritance, for the Lord Himself is their inheritance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013890"><a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse20">Numbers&nbsp;18:20</a></span> And again, <q>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> shall have no part in the whole tribe of Levi, nor substance with <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; their substance is the offerings (<em>fructifications</em>) of the Lord: these shall they eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013891"><a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;18:1</a></span> Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>I do not seek after a gift, but I seek after fruit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013892"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse17">Philippians&nbsp;4:17</a></span> To His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> He said, who had a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the Lord,  to whom it was lawful when hungry to eat the ears of grain,  <q>For the workman is worthy of his meat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013895"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;10:10</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the temple profaned the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and were blameless. Wherefore, then, were they blameless? Because when in the temple they were not engaged in secular affairs, but in the service of the Lord, fulfilling the law, but not going beyond it, as that man did, who of his own accord carried dry wood into the camp of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note013896"><a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse32">Numbers&nbsp;15:32</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> <q>For every tree that brings not forth good fruit shall be hewn down, and cast into the fire;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013897"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> and <q>whosoever shall defile the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him shall God defile.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013898"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> </p>
