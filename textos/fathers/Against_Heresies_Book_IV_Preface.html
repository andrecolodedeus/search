<h1>Against Heresies (Book IV, Preface)</h1>

<p>1. By transmitting to you, my very dear friend, this fourth book of the work which is [entitled] <em>The Detection and Refutation of False Knowledge</em>, I shall, as I have promised, add weight, by means of the words of the Lord, to what I have already advanced; so that you also, as you have requested, may obtain from me the means of confuting all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> everywhere, and not permit them, beaten back at all points, to launch out further into the deep of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, nor to be drowned in the sea of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; but that you, turning them into the haven of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to attain their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>2. The man, however, who would undertake their conversion, must possess an accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their systems or schemes of doctrine. For it is impossible for any one to heal the sick, if he has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the disease of the patients. This was the reason that my predecessors&mdash; much superior men to myself, too &mdash; were unable, notwithstanding, to refute the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> satisfactorily, because they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these men's system;  which I have with all care delivered to you in the first book in which I have also shown that their doctrine is a recapitulation of all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For which reason also, in the second, we have had, as in a mirror, a sight of their entire discomfiture. For they who oppose these men (the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>) by the right method, do [thereby] oppose all who are of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mind; and they who overthrow them, do in fact overthrow every kind of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>3. For their system is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> above all [others], since they represent that the Maker and Framer, who is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, as I have shown, was produced from a defect or <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>. They utter <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, also, against our Lord, by cutting off and dividing Jesus from Christ, and Christ from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and again the Saviour from the Word, and the Word from the Only-begotten. And since they allege that the Creator originated from a defect or <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, so have they also taught that Christ and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> were emitted on account of this defect, and that the Saviour was a product of those <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> who were produced from a defect; so that there is nothing but <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to be found among them. In the preceding book, then, the ideas of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as to all these points have been set forth, [to the effect] that not only did they, <q>who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013799"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;1:2</a></span> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, hold no such opinions, but that they did also preach to us to shun these doctrines, <span class="stiki" id="note013800"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse23">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:23</a></span> foreseeing by the Spirit those weak-minded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who should be led astray. </p>

<p>4. For as the serpent beguiled Eve, by promising her what he had not himself, <span class="stiki" id="note013802"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:19</a>.</span> so also do these men, by pretending [to possess] superior <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and [to be acquainted with] ineffable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; and, by promising that admittance which they speak of as taking place within the Pleroma, plunge those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them into death, rendering them <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> from Him who made them. And at that time, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, having effected the disobedience of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> by means of the serpent, imagined that he escaped the notice of the Lord; wherefore God assigned him the form  and name [of a serpent]. But now, since the last times are [come upon us], <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is spread abroad among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which not only renders them <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, but by many machinations does [the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>] raise up <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> against the  Creator, namely, by means of all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> already mentioned. For all these, although they issue forth from diverse regions, and promulgate different [opinions], do nevertheless concur in the same <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> design, wounding [men] unto death, by teaching <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against God our Maker and Supporter, and derogating from the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of man. Now man is a mixed organization of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh, who was formed after the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and moulded by His hands, that is, by the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, to whom also He said, <q>Let Us make man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note013804"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> This, then, is the aim of him who envies our life, to render men disbelievers in their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> against God the Creator. For whatsoever all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may have advanced with the utmost <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, they come to this at last, that they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Creator, and disallow the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of God's workmanship, which the flesh <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is; on behalf of which I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, in a variety of ways, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> accomplished the whole dispensation [of mercy], and have shown that there is none other called God by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> except the Father of all, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and those who possess the adoption.</p>
