<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 15)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Sige relates to Marcus the generation of the twenty-four elements and of Jesus. Exposure of these absurdities.</span>

<p>1. The all-wise Sige then announced the production of the four-and-twenty elements to him as follows:&mdash; Along with Monotes there coexisted Henotes, from which sprang two productions, as we have remarked above, Monas and Hen, which, added to the other two, make four, for twice two are four. And again, two and four, when added together, exhibit the number six. And further, these six being quadrupled, give rise to the twenty-four forms. And the names of the first Tetrad, which are understood to be most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and not capable of being expressed in words, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the Son alone, while the father also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what they are. The other names which are to be uttered with respect, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and reverence, are, according to him, Arrhetos and Sige, Pater and Aletheia. Now the entire number of this Tetrad amounts to four-and-twenty letters; for the name Arrhetos contains in itself seven letters, Seige  five, Pater five, and Aletheia seven. If all these be added together&mdash; twice five, and twice seven&mdash; they complete the number twenty-four. In like manner, also, the second Tetrad, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia, reveal the same number of elements. Moreover, that name of the Saviour which may be pronounced, viz., Jesus [<span class="greek">&#x1FBF;&#x0399;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C2;</span>], consists of six letters, but His unutterable name comprises four-and-twenty letters. The name <em>Christ the Son</em>  (<span class="greek">&#x03C5;&#x1F31;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x03A7;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>) comprises twelve letters, but that which is unpronounceable in Christ contains thirty letters. And for this reason he declares that He is <em>Alpha</em> and <em>Omega</em>, that he may indicate the dove, inasmuch as that bird has this number [in its name].</p>

<p>2. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he affirms, has the following unspeakable origin. From the mother of all things, that is, the first Tetrad, there came forth the second Tetrad, after the manner of a daughter; and thus an Ogdoad was formed, from which, again, a Decad proceeded: thus was produced a Decad and an Ogdoad. The Decad, then, being joined with the Ogdoad, and multiplying it ten times, gave rise to the number <em>eighty</em>; and, again, multiplying eighty ten times, produced the number <em>eight hundred</em>. Thus, then, the whole number of the letters proceeding from the Ogdoad [multiplied] into the Decad, is eight hundred and eighty-eight.  This is the name of Jesus; for this name, if you reckon up the numerical value of the letters, amounts to eight hundred and eighty-eight. Thus, then, you have a clear statement of their opinion as to the origin of the supercelestial Jesus. Wherefore, also, the alphabet of the Greeks contains eight <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monads</a>, eight Decads, and eight Hecatads , which present the number eight hundred and eighty-eight, that is, <em>Jesus</em>, who is formed of all numbers; and on this account He is called <em>Alpha</em> and <em>Omega</em>, indicating His origin from all. And, again, they put the matter thus: If the first Tetrad be added up according to the progression of number, the number ten appears. For one, and two, and three, and four, when added together, form ten; and this, as they will have it, is Jesus. Moreover, Chreistus, he says, being a word of eight letters, indicates the first Ogdoad, and this, when multiplied by ten, gives birth to Jesus (888). And Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, he says, is also spoken of, that is, the Duodecad. For the name Son, (<span class="greek">&#x03C5;&#x1F30;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>) contains four letters, and Christ (Chreistus) eight, which, being combined, point out the greatness of the Duodecad. But, he alleges, before the <em>Episemon</em> of this name appeared, that is Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> were involved in great <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But when this name of six letters was manifested (the person bearing it clothing Himself in flesh, that He might come under the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> senses, and having in Himself these six and twenty-four letters), then, becoming acquainted with Him, they ceased from their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and passed from death unto life, this name serving as their guide to the Father of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  For the Father of all had resolved to put an end to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and to destroy death. But this abolishing of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was just the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him. And therefore that man (Anthropos) was chosen according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, having been formed after the image of the [corresponding] power above.</p>

<p>3. As to the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, they proceeded from the Tetrad, and in that Tetrad were Anthropos and Ecclesia, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and Zoe. The powers, then, he declares, who emanated from these, generated that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who appeared upon the earth. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel took the place of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> that of Zoe, the Power of the Highest that of Anthropos, while the Virgin pointed out the place of Ecclesia. And thus, by a special dispensation, there was generated by Him, through Mary, that man, whom, as He passed through the womb, the Father of all chose to [obtain] the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself by means of the Word. And on His coming to the water [of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>], there descended on Him, in the form of a dove,  that Being who had formerly ascended on high, and completed the twelfth number, in whom there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> the seed of those who were produced contemporaneously with Himself, and who descended and ascended along with Him. Moreover, he maintains that power which descended was the seed of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which had in itself both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as well as that power of Sige which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by means of them, but cannot be expressed in language, and also all the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. And this was that Spirit who spoke by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and who confessed that He was the son of Man as well as revealed the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and who, having descended into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, was made one with Him. And he says that the Saviour formed by special dispensation did indeed destroy death, but that Christ made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father.  He maintains, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the name of that man formed by a special dispensation, and that He was formed after the likeness and form of that [heavenly] Anthropos, who was about to descend upon Him. After He had received that <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, He possessed Anthropos himself, and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> himself, and Pater, and Arrhetus, and Sige, and Aletheia, and Ecclesia, and Zoe.</p>

<p>4. Such ravings, we may now well say, go beyond <em>Iu, Iu, Pheu, Pheu</em>, and every kind of tragic exclamation or utterance of misery.  For who would not detest one who is the wretched contriver of such audacious falsehoods, when he perceives the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> turned by Marcus into a mere image, and that punctured all over with the letters of the alphabet? The Greeks confess that they first received sixteen letters from Cadmus, and that but recently, as compared with the beginning, [the vast antiquity of which is implied] in the common proverb: <q>Yesterday and before;</q>  and afterwards, in the course of time, they themselves invented at one period the aspirates, and at another the double letters, while, last of all, they say Palamedes added the long letters to the former. Was it so, then, that until these things took place among the Greeks, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>? For, according to you, Marcus, the body of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is posterior to Cadmus and those who preceded him&mdash; posterior also to those who added the rest of the letters&mdash; posterior even to yourself! For you alone have formed that which is called by you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into an [outward, visible] image.</p>

<p>5. But who will tolerate your nonsensical Sige, who names Him that cannot be named, and expounds the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Him that is unspeakable, and searches out Him that is unsearchable, and declares that He whom you maintain to be destitute of body and form, opened His mouth and sent forth the Word, as if He were included among organized beings; and that His Word, while like to His Author, and bearing the image of the invisible, nevertheless consisted of thirty elements and four syllables? It will follow, then, according to your theory, that the Father of all, in accordance with the likeness of the Word, consists of thirty elements and four syllables! Or, again, who will tolerate you in your juggling with forms and numbers&mdash;at one time thirty, at another twenty-four, and at another, again, only six&mdash;while you shut up [in these] the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, the Founder, and Framer, and Maker of all things; and then, again, cutting Him up piecemeal into four syllables and thirty elements; and bringing down the Lord of all who founded the heavens to the number eight hundred and eighty-eight, so that He should be similar to the alphabet; and subdividing the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who cannot be contained, but contains all things, into a Tetrad, and an Ogdoad, and a Decad, and a Duodecad; and by such multiplications, setting forth the unspeakable and inconceivable nature of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as you yourself declarest it to be? And showing yourself a very D&aelig;dalus for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> invention, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> architect of the supreme power, you construct a nature and substance for Him whom you call incorporeal and immaterial, out of a multitude of letters, generated the one by the other. And that power whom you affirm to be indivisible, you nevertheless divide into consonants, and vowels, and semi-vowels; and, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribing those letters which are mute to the Father of all things, and to His Enn&oelig;a (thought), you have driven on all that place confidence in you to the highest point of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and to the grossest impiety. </p>

<p>6. With good reason, therefore, and very fittingly, in reference to your rash attempt, has that divine elder  and preacher of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> burst forth in verse against you as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Marcus, you former of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, inspector of portents,<br>Skill'd in consulting the stars, and deep in the black arts of magic,<br>Ever by tricks such as these confirming the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>,<br>Furnishing signs unto those involved by you in deception,<br>Wonders of power that is utterly severed from God and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>,<br>Which <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> father, enables you still to accomplish,<br>By means of Azazel, that fallen and yet mighty <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>&mdash;<br>Thus making you the precursor of his own impious actions.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Such are the words of the saintly elder. And I shall endeavour to state the remainder of their mystical system, which runs out to great length, in brief compass, and to bring to the light what  has for a long time been concealed. For in this way such things will become easily susceptible of exposure by all.</p>
