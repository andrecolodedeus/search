<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 17)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The theory of the Marcosians, that created things were made after the image of things invisible.</span>

<p>1. I wish also to explain to you their theory as to the way in which the creation itself was formed through the mother by the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> (as it were without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>), after the image of things invisible. They maintain, then, that first of all the four elements, fire, water, earth, and air, were produced after the image of the primary Tetrad above, and that then, we add their operations, viz., heat, cold, dryness, and humidity, an exact likeness of the Ogdoad is presented. They next reckon up ten powers in the following manner:&mdash; There are seven globular bodies, which they also call heavens; then that globular body which contains these, which also they name the eighth heaven; and, in addition to these, the sun and moon. These, being ten in number, they declare to be types of the invisible Decad, which proceeded from <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and Zoe. As to the Duodecad, it is indicated by the zodiacal circle, as it is called; for they affirm that the twelve signs do most manifestly shadow forth the Duodecad, the daughter of Anthropos and Ecclesia. And since the highest heaven, beating upon the very sphere [of the seventh heaven], has been linked with the most rapid precession of the whole system, as a check, and balancing that system with its own gravity, so that it completes the cycle from sign to sign in thirty years&mdash;they say that this is an image of Horus, encircling their thirty-named mother.  And then, again, as the moon travels through her allotted space of heaven in thirty days, they hold, that by these days she expresses the number of the thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. The sun also, who runs through his orbit in twelve months, and then returns to the same point in the circle, makes the Duodecad manifest by these twelve months; and the days, as being measured by twelve hours, are a type of the invisible Duodecad. Moreover, they declare that the hour, which is the twelfth part of the day, is composed  of thirty parts, in order to set forth the image of the Triacontad. Also the circumference of the zodiacal circle itself contains three hundred and sixty degrees (for each of its signs comprises thirty); and thus also they affirm, that by means of this circle an image is preserved of that connection which exists between the twelve and the thirty. Still further, asserting that the earth is divided into twelve zones, and that in each zone it receives power from the heavens, according to the perpendicular [position of the sun above it], bringing forth productions corresponding to that power which sends down its influence upon it, they maintain that this is a most evident type of the Duodecad and its offspring.</p>

<p>2. In addition to these things, they declare that the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, desiring to imitate the infinitude, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and immensity, and freedom from all measurement by time of the Ogdoad above, but, as he was the fruit of defect, being unable to express its permanence and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, had recourse to the expedient of spreading out its <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> into times, and seasons, and vast numbers of years, imagining, that by the multitude of such times he might imitate its immensity.  They declare further, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> having escaped him, he followed that which was false, and that, for this reason, when the times are fulfilled, his work shall perish.</p>
