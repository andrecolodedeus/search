<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 20)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The apocryphal and spurious Scriptures of the Marcosians, with passages of the Gospels which they pervert.</span>

<p>1. Besides the above [misrepresentations], they adduce an unspeakable number of <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and spurious writings, which they themselves have forged, to bewilder the minds of foolish men, and of such as are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Among other things, they bring forward that false and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> story  which  relates that our Lord, when He was a boy learning His letters, on the teacher saying to Him, as is usual, <q>Pronounce Alpha,</q> replied [as He was bid], <q>Alpha.</q> But when, again, the teacher bade Him say, <q>Beta,</q> the Lord replied, <q>First tell me what Alpha is, and then I will tell you what Beta is.</q> This they expound as meaning that He alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Unknown, which He revealed under its type Alpha.</p>

<p>2. Some passages, also, which occur in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, receive from them a colouring of the same kind, such as the answer which He gave His mother when He was twelve years of age: <q>Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012912"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;2:49</a></span> Thus, they say, He announced to them the Father of whom they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. On this account, also, He sent forth the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to the twelve tribes, that they might proclaim to them the unknown God. And to the person who said to Him, <q>Good Master,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012913"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;10:17</a></span> He confessed that God who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good, saying, <q>Why do you call Me good: there is One who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the Father in the heavens;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012914"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;18:18</a></span> and they assert that in this passage the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> receive the name of heavens. Moreover, by His not replying to those who said to Him, <q>By what power do You this?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012915"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;21:23</a></span> but by a question on His own side, put them to utter confusion; by His thus not replying, according to their interpretation, He showed the unutterable nature of the Father. Moreover, when He said, <q>I have often desired to hear one of these words, and I had no one who could utter it,</q>  they maintain, that by this expression <q>one</q> He set forth the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. Further, when, as He drew near to Jerusalem, He wept over it and said, <q>If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, even you, in this your day, the things that belong unto your peace, but they are hidden from you,</q>  by this word <q>hidden</q> He showed the abstruse nature of Bythus. And again, when He said, <q>Come unto Me all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, and learn of Me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012918"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28</a></span> He announced the Father of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, these men say that He promised to teach them.</p>

<p>3. But they adduce the following passage as the highest testimony,  and, as it were, the very crown of their system:&mdash; <q>I thank You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and have revealed them to babes. Even so, my Father; for so it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in Your sight. All things have been delivered to Me by My Father; and no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the Son but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012920"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;11:25-27</a></span> In these words they affirm that He clearly showed that the Father of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, conjured into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by them, was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to no one before His advent. And they desire to construe the passage as if teaching that the Maker and Framer [of the world] was always <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by all, while the Lord spoke these words concerning the Father unknown to all, whom they now proclaim.</p>
