<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 21)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The views of redemption entertained by these heretics.</span>

<p>1. It happens that their tradition respecting <em>redemption</em>  is invisible and incomprehensible, as being the mother of things which are incomprehensible and invisible; and on this account, since it is fluctuating, it is impossible simply and all at once to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> its nature, for every one of them hands it down just as his own inclination prompts. Thus there are as many schemes of <q>redemption</q> as there are teachers of these mystical opinions. And when we come to refute them, we shall show in its fitting-place, that this class of men have been instigated by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to a denial of that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is regeneration to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus to a renunciation of the whole [<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>] <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>2. They maintain that those who have attained to perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must of necessity be regenerated into that power which is above all. For it is otherwise impossible to find admittance within the Pleroma, since this [regeneration] it is which leads them down into the depths of Bythus. For the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> instituted by the visible Jesus was for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but the redemption brought in by that Christ who descended upon Him, was for perfection; and they allege that the former is animal, but the latter spiritual. And the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was proclaimed with a view to repentance, but the redemption by Jesus  was brought in for the sake of perfection. And to this He refers when He says, <q>And I have another <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with, and I hasten eagerly towards it.</q>  Moreover, they affirm that the Lord added this redemption to the sons of Zebedee, when their mother asked that they might sit, the one on His right hand, and the other on His left, in His kingdom, saying, <q>Can you be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which I shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012924"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse38">Mark&nbsp;10:38</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, too, they declare, has often set forth, in express terms, the redemption which is in Christ  Jesus; and this was the same which is handed down by them in so varied and discordant forms.</p>

<p>3. For some of them prepare a nuptial couch, and perform a sort of mystic rite (pronouncing certain expressions) with those who are being initiated, and affirm that it is a spiritual marriage which is celebrated by them, after the likeness of the conjunctions above. Others, again, lead them to a place where water is, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them, with the utterance of these words, <q>Into the name of the unknown Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>&mdash; into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the mother of all things&mdash; into Him who descended on Jesus&mdash; into union, and redemption, and communion with the powers.</q> Others still repeat certain Hebrew words, in order the more thoroughly to bewilder those who are being initiated, as follows: <q>Basema, Chamosse, Ba&oelig;naora, Mistadia, Ruada, Kousta, Babaphor, Kalachthei.</q>  The interpretation of these terms runs thus: <q>I invoke that which is above every power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which is called light, and good Spirit, and life, because You have reigned in the body.</q> Others, again, set forth the redemption thus: The name which is hidden from every deity, and dominion, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> was clothed with in the lives  of the light of Christ&mdash; of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who lives by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for the angelic redemption. The name of restitution stands thus: Messia, Uphareg, Namemps&oelig;man, Chald&oelig;aur, Mosomed&oelig;a, Acphran&oelig;, Psaua, Jesus Nazaria.  The interpretation of these words is as follows: <q>I do not divide the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, neither the heart nor the supercelestial power which is merciful; may I enjoy Your name, O Saviour of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>!</q> Such are words of the initiators; but he who is initiated, replies, <q>I am established, and I am redeemed; I redeem my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from this age (world), and from all things connected with it in the name of Iao, who redeemed his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into redemption in Christ who lives.</q> Then the bystanders add these words, <q>Peace be to all on whom this name rests.</q> After this they anoint the initiated person with balsam; for they assert that this ointment is a type of that sweet odour which is above all things.</p>

<p>4. But there are some of them who assert that it is superfluous to bring <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to the water, but mixing oil and water together, they place this mixture on the heads of those who are to be initiated, with the use of some such expressions as we have already mentioned. And this they maintain to be the redemption. They, too, are accustomed to anoint with balsam. Others, however, reject all these practices, and maintain that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the unspeakable and invisible power ought not to be performed by visible and corruptible creatures, nor should that of those [beings] who are inconceivable, and incorporeal, and beyond the reach of sense, [be performed] by such as are the objects of sense, and possessed of a body. These hold that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the unspeakable Greatness is itself perfect redemption. For since both defect and passion flowed from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the whole substance of what was thus formed is destroyed by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the redemption of the inner man. This, however, is not of a corporeal nature, for the body is corruptible; nor is it animal, since the animal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the fruit of a defect, and is, as it were, the abode of the spirit. The redemption must therefore be of a spiritual nature; for they affirm that the inner and spiritual man is redeemed by means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and that they, having acquired the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all things, stand thenceforth in need of nothing else. This, then, is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> redemption.</p>

<p>5. Others still there are who continue to redeem <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> even up to the moment of death, by placing on their heads oil and water, or the pre-mentioned ointment with water, using at the same time the above-named invocations, that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> referred to may become incapable of being seized or seen by the principalities and powers, and that their inner man may ascend on high in an invisible manner, as if their body were left among <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things in this world, while their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sent forward to the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>. And they instruct them, on their reaching the principalities and powers, to make use of these words: <q>I am a son from the Father&mdash; the Father who had a pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and a son in Him who is pre-existent. I have come to behold all things, both those which belong to myself and others, although, strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, but to Achamoth, who is female in nature, and made these things for herself. For I derive being from Him who is pre-existent, and I come again to my own place whence I went forth.</q> And they affirm that, by saying these things, he escapes from the powers. He then advances to the companions of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and thus addresses them:&mdash; <q>I am a vessel more precious than the female who formed you. If your mother is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of her own descent, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> myself, and am aware whence I am, and I call upon the incorruptible Sophia, who is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and is the mother of your mother, who has no father, nor any male consort; but a female springing from a female formed you, while <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of her own mother, and imagining that she alone <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>; but I call upon her mother.</q> And they declare, that when the companions of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> hear these words, they are greatly agitated, and upbraid their origin and the race of their mother. But he goes into his own place, having  thrown [off] his chain, that is, his animal nature. These, then, are the particulars which have reached us respecting <q>redemption.</q>  But since they differ so widely among themselves both as respects doctrine and tradition, and since those of them who are recognised as being most modern make it their effort daily to invent some new opinion, and to bring out what no one ever before thought of, it is a difficult matter to describe all their opinions.</p>
