<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 22)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Deviations of heretics from the truth.</span>

<p>1. The rule  of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which we hold, is, that there is one God Almighty, who made all things by His Word, and fashioned and formed, out of that which had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, all things which exist. Thus says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, to that effect <q>By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established, and all the might of them, by the spirit of His mouth.</q>  And again, <q>All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012931"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> There is no exception or deduction stated; but the Father made all things by Him, whether visible or invisible, objects of sense or of intelligence, temporal, on account of a certain character given them, or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and these <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>  things He did not make by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or by any powers separated from His Enn&oelig;a. For God needs none of all these things, but is He who, by His Word and Spirit, makes, and disposes, and governs all things, and commands all things into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>&mdash;He who formed the world (for the world is of all)&mdash;He who fashioned man&mdash;He [who]  is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, above whom there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor initial principle, nor power, nor pleroma,&mdash; He is the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, as we shall prove. Holding, therefore, this rule, we shall easily show, notwithstanding the great variety and multitude of their opinions, that these men have deviated from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for almost all the different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> admit that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>; but then, by their pernicious doctrines, they change [this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>], even as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> do through <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>&mdash;thus proving themselves ungrateful to Him that created them. Moreover, they despise the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, speaking against their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, becoming their own bitterest accusers, and being false witnesses [against themselves]. Yet, reluctant as they may be, these men shall one day rise again in the flesh, to confess the power of Him who raises them from the dead; but they shall not be numbered among the righteous on account of their unbelief.</p>

<p>2. Since, therefore, it is a complex and multiform task to detect and convict all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and since our design is to reply to them all according to their special characters, we have judged it necessary, first of all, to give an account of their source and root, in order that, by getting a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their most exalted Bythus, you may understand the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the tree which has produced such fruits.</p>
