<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 24)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Doctrines of Saturninus and Basilides.</span>

<p>1. Arising among these men, Saturninus (who was of that <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> which is near Daphne) and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> laid hold of some favourable opportunities, and promulgated different systems of  doctrine&mdash; the one in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the other at Alexandria. Saturninus, like Menander, set forth one father unknown to all, who made <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, archangels, powers, and potentates. The world, again, and all things therein, were made by a certain company of seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Man, too, was the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, a shining image bursting forth below from the presence of the supreme power; and when they could not, he says, keep hold of this, because it immediately darted upwards again, they exhorted each other, saying, <q>Let us make man after our image and likeness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012940"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> He was accordingly formed, yet was unable to stand erect, through the inability of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to convey to him that power, but wriggled [on the ground] like a worm. Then the power above taking pity upon him, since he was made after his likeness, sent forth a spark of life, which gave man an erect posture, compacted his joints, and made him live. He declares, therefore, that this spark of life, after the death of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, returns to those things which are of the same nature with itself, and the rest of the body is decomposed into its original elements.</p>

<p>2. He has also laid it down as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that the Saviour was without birth, without body, and without figure, but was, by supposition, a visible man; and he maintained that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was one of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and, on this account, because all the powers wished to annihilate his father, Christ came to destroy the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but to save such as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him; that is, those who possess the spark of his life. This <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was the first to affirm that two kinds of men were formed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;the one <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and the other good. And since the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> assist the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, the Saviour came for the destruction of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men and of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the good. They declare also, that marriage and generation are from <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note012941"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:3</a>.</span> Many of those, too, who belong to his school, abstain from animal food, and draw away multitudes by a feigned <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> of this kind. They hold, moreover, that some of the prophecies were uttered by those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who made the world, and some by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; whom Saturninus represents as being himself an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, the enemy of the creators of the world, but especially of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>3. <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> again, that he may appear to have discovered something more sublime and plausible, gives an immense development to his doctrines. He sets forth that Nous was first born of the unborn father, that from him, again, was born <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, from <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> Phronesis, from Phronesis Sophia and Dynamis, and from Dynamis and Sophia the powers, and principalities, and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whom he also calls the <em>first</em>; and that by them the first heaven was made. Then other powers, being formed by emanation from these, created another heaven similar to the first; and in like manner, when others, again, had been formed by emanation from them, corresponding exactly to those above them, these, too, framed another third heaven; and then from this third, in downward order, there was a fourth succession of descendants; and so on, after the same fashion, they declare that more and more principalities and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were formed, and three hundred and sixty-five heavens.  Wherefore the year contains the same number of days in conformity with the number of the heavens.</p>

<p>4. Those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who occupy the lowest heaven, that, namely, which is visible to us, formed all the things which are in the world, and made allotments among themselves of the earth and of those nations which are upon it. The chief of them is he who is thought to be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and inasmuch as he desired to render the other nations subject to his own people, that is, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, all the other princes resisted and opposed him. Wherefore all other nations were at enmity with his nation. But the father without birth and without name, perceiving that they would be destroyed, sent his own first-begotten Nous (he it is who is called Christ) to bestow deliverance on those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him, from the power of those who made the world. He appeared, then, on earth as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to the nations of these powers, and wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Wherefore he did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, was crucified, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all. Those, then, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things have been freed from the principalities who formed the world; so that it is not incumbent on us to confess him who was crucified, but him who came in the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and was thought to be crucified, and was called <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and was sent by the father, that by this dispensation he might destroy the works of the makers of the world. If any one, therefore, he declares, confesses the crucified, that man is still a slave, and under the power of those who formed our bodies; but he who denies him has been freed from these beings, and is acquainted with the dispensation of the unborn father.</p>

<p>  5. Salvation belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, for the body is by nature subject to corruption. He declares, too, that the prophecies were derived from those powers who were the makers of the world, but the law was specially given by their chief, who led the people out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. He attaches no importance to [the question regarding] meats offered in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, thinks them of no consequence, and makes use of them without any hesitation; he holds also the use of other things, and the practice of every kind of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, a matter of perfect indifference. These men, moreover, practise magic; and use images, incantations, invocations, and every other kind of curious art. Coining also certain names as if they were those of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, they proclaim some of these as belonging to the first, and others to the second heaven; and then they strive to set forth the names, principles, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and powers of the three hundred and sixty-five imagined heavens. They also affirm that the barbarous name in which the Saviour ascended and descended, is Caulacau. </p>

<p>6. He, then, who has learned [these things], and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and their causes, is rendered invisible and incomprehensible to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and all the powers, even as Caulacau also was. And as the son was unknown to all, so must they also be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by no one; but while they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all, and pass through all, they themselves remain invisible and unknown to all; for, <q>Do you,</q> they say, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all, but let nobody <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you.</q> For this reason, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of such a persuasion are also ready to recant [their opinions], yea, rather, it is impossible that they should suffer on account of a mere name, since they are like to all. The multitude, however, cannot understand these matters, but only one out of a thousand, or two out of ten thousand. They declare that they are no longer <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and that they are not yet <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and that it is not at all fitting to speak openly of their <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, but right to keep them secret by preserving silence.</p>

<p>7. They make out the local position of the three hundred and sixty-five heavens in the same way as do mathematicians. For, accepting the theorems of these latter, they have transferred them to their own type of doctrine. They hold that their chief is <em>Abraxas;</em>  and, on this account, that word contains in itself the numbers amounting to three hundred and sixty-five.</p>
