<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 26)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Doctrines of Cerinthus, the Ebionites, and Nicolaitanes.</span>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, again, a man who was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>  in the wisdom of the Egyptians, taught that the world was not made by the primary <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by a certain Power far separated from him, and at a distance from that Principality who is supreme  over the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of him who is above all. He represented Jesus as having not been born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but as being the son of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> according to the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, while he nevertheless was more righteous, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and wise than other men. Moreover, after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, and performed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. But at last Christ departed from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and that then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained impassible, inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.</p>

<p>2. Those who are called <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a> agree that the world was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but their opinions with respect to the Lord are similar to those of <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> and Carpocrates. They use the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew only, and repudiate the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, maintaining that he was an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the law. As to the prophetical writings, they endeavour to expound them in a somewhat singular manner: they practise <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, persevere in the observance of those customs which are enjoined by the law, and are so Judaic in their style of life, that they even adore Jerusalem as if it were the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>3. The Nicolaitanes are the followers of that Nicolas who was one of the seven first ordained to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.  They lead lives of unrestrained indulgence. The character of these men is very plainly pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, [when they are represented] as teaching that it is a matter of indifference to practise <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and to eat things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Wherefore the Word has also spoken of them thus: <q>But this you have, that you hate the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the Nicolaitanes, which I also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012957"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;2:6</a></span> </p>
