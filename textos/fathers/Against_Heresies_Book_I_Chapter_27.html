<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 27)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Doctrines of Cerdo and Marcion.</span>

<p>1. Cerdo was one who took his system from the followers of Simon, and came to live at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>, who held the ninth place in the episcopal succession from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> downwards. He taught that the God proclaimed by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was not the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. For the former was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but the latter unknown; while the one also was righteous, but the other benevolent.</p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> succeeded him, and developed his doctrine. In so doing, he advanced the most daring <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against Him who is proclaimed as God by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, declaring Him to be the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, to take delight in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, to be infirm of purpose, and even to be contrary to Himself. But Jesus being derived from that father who is above the God that made the world, and coming into Jud&aelig;a in the times of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> the governor, who was the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> C&aelig;sar, was manifested in the form of a man to those who were in Jud&aelig;a, abolishing the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the law, and all the works of that God who made the world, whom also he calls Cosmocrator. Besides this, he mutilates the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which is according to Luke, removing all that is written respecting the generation of the Lord, and setting aside a great deal of the teaching of the Lord, in which the Lord is recorded as most dearly confessing that the Maker of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is His Father. He likewise persuaded his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that he himself was more worthy of credit than are those <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who have handed down the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to us, furnishing them not with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but merely a fragment of it. In like manner, too, he dismembered the Epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, removing all that is said by the apostle respecting that God who made the world, to the effect that He is the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and also those passages from the prophetical writings which the apostle quotes, in order to teach us that they announced beforehand the coming of the Lord.</p>

<p>3. Salvation will be the attainment only of those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which had learned his doctrine; while the body, as having been taken from the earth, is incapable of sharing in <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In addition to his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against God Himself, he advanced this also, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> speaking as with the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and saying all things in direct opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;that Cain, and those like him, and the Sodomites, and the Egyptians, and others like them, and, in fine, all the nations who walked in all sorts of abomination, were saved by the Lord, on His descending into Hades, and on their running unto Him, and that they welcomed Him into their kingdom. But the serpent  which was in <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> declared that Abel, and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and those other righteous men who sprang  from the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, with all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and those who were pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did not partake in <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For since these men, he says, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that their God was constantly tempting them, so now they suspected that He was tempting them, and did not run to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His announcement: and for this reason he declared that their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> remained in Hades.</p>

<p>4. But since this man is the only one who has dared openly to mutilate the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and unblushingly above all others to inveigh against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I purpose specially to refute him, convicting  him out of his own writings; and, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I shall overthrow him out of those  discourses of the Lord and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, which are of authority with him, and of which he makes use. At present, however, I have simply been led to mention him, that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all those who in any way corrupt the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and injuriously affect the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and successors of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. Although they do not confess the name of their master, in order all the more to seduce others, yet they do teach his doctrines. They set forth, indeed, the name of Christ Jesus as a sort of lure, but in various ways they introduce the impieties of Simon; and thus they destroy multitudes, wickedly disseminating their own doctrines by the use of a good name, and, through means of its sweetness and beauty, extending to their hearers the bitter and malignant poison of the serpent, the great author of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note012961"><a href="../bible/rev012.htm#verse9">Revelation&nbsp;12:9</a>.</span> </p>
