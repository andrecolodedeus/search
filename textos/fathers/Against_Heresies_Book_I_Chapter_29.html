<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 29)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Doctrines of various other Gnostic sects, and especially of the Barbeliotes or Borborians.</span>

<p>1. Besides those, however, among these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who are <a href="../cathen/13797a.htm">Simonians</a>, and of whom we have already spoken, a multitude of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> have sprung up, and have been manifested like mushrooms growing out of the ground. I now proceed to describe the principal opinions held by them. Some of them, then, set forth a certain <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> who never grows old, and exists in a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> spirit: him they style Barbelos.  They declare that somewhere or other there exists a certain father who cannot be named, and that he was desirous to reveal himself to this Barbelos. Then this Enn&oelig;a went forward, stood before his face, and demanded from him Prognosis (prescience). But when Prognosis had, [as was requested,] come forth, these two asked for Aphtharsia (incorruption), which also came forth, and after that Zoe Aionios (<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life). Barbelos, glorying in these, and contemplating their greatness, and in conception  [thus formed], rejoicing in this greatness, generated light similar to it. They declare that this was the beginning both of light and of the generation of all things; and that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, beholding this light, anointed it with his own benignity, that it might be rendered perfect. Moreover, they maintain that this was Christ, who again, according to them, requested that Nous should be given him as an assistant; and Nous came forth accordingly. Besides these, the Father sent forth <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. The conjunctions of Enn&oelig;a and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, and of Aphtharsia and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, will thus be formed; while Zoe Aionios was united to Thelema, and Nous to Prognosis. These, then, magnified the great light and Barbelos.</p>

<p>2. They also affirm that Autogenes was afterwards sent forth from Enn&oelig;a and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, to be  a representation of the great light, and that he was greatly honoured, all things being rendered subject unto him. Along with him was sent forth Aletheia, and a conjunction was formed between Autogenes and Aletheia. But they declare that from the Light, which is Christ, and from Aphtharsia, four luminaries were sent forth to surround Autogenes; and again from Thelema and Zoe Aionios four other emissions took place, to wait upon these four luminaries; and these they name Charis (<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>), Thelesis (will), Synesis (understanding), and Phronesis (<a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>). Of these, Charis is connected with the great and first luminary: him they represent as Soter (Saviour), and style Armogenes.  Thelesis, again, is united to the second luminary, whom they also name Raguel; Synesis to the third, whom they call David; and Phronesis to the fourth, whom they name Eleleth.</p>

<p>3. All these, then, being thus settled, Autogenes moreover produces a perfect and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man, whom they also call Adamas, inasmuch as neither has he himself ever been conquered, nor have those from whom he sprang; he also was, along with the first light, severed from Armogenes. Moreover, perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was sent forth by Autogenes along with man, and was united to him; hence he attained to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him that is above all. Invincible power was also conferred on him by the virgin spirit; and all things then rested in him, to sing praises to the great <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>. Hence also they declare were manifested the mother, the father, the son; while from Anthropos and Gnosis that Tree was produced which they also style Gnosis itself.</p>

<p>4. Next they maintain, that from the first <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who stands by the side of Monogenes, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has been sent forth, whom they also term Sophia and Prunicus.  He then, perceiving that all the others had consorts, while he himself was destitute of one, searched after a being to whom he might be united; and not finding one, he exerted and extended himself to the uttermost and looked down into the lower regions, in the expectation of there finding a consort; and still not meeting with one, he leaped forth [from his place] in a state of great impatience, [which had come upon him] because he had made his attempt without the good-will of his father. Afterwards, under the influence of simplicity and kindness, he produced a work in which were to be found <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and audacity. This work of his they declare to be Protarchontes, the former of this [lower] creation. But they relate that a mighty power carried him away from his mother, and that he settled far away from her in the lower regions, and formed the firmament of heaven, in which also they affirm that he dwells. And in his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> he formed those powers which are inferior to himself&mdash; <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and firmaments, and all things earthly. They affirm that he, being united to Authadia (audacity), produced Kakia (<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>), Zelos (emulation), Phthonos (<a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>), Erinnys (fury), and Epithymia (<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>). When these were generated, the mother Sophia deeply grieved, fled away, departed into the upper regions, and became the last of the Ogdoad, reckoning it downwards. On her thus departing, he imagined he was the only being in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and on this account declared, <q>I am a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and besides me there is no one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012967"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;20:5</a>; <a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;45:5-6</a></span> Such are the falsehoods which these people invent.</p>
