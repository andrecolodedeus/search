<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 3)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Texts of Holy Scripture used by these heretics to support their opinions.</span>

<p>1. Such, then, is the account they give of what took place within the Pleroma; such the calamities that flowed from the passion which seized upon the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> who has been named, and who was within a little of perishing by being absorbed in the universal substance, through her inquisitive searching after the Father; such the consolidation  [of that <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>] from her condition of agony by Horos, and Stauros, and Lytrotes, and Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges.  Such also is the account of the generation of the later <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, namely of the first Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, both of whom were produced by the Father after the repentance  [of Sophia], and of the second  Christ (whom they also style Saviour), who owed his being to the joint contributions [of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>]. They tell us, however, that this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has not been openly divulged, because all are not capable of receiving it, but has been <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> revealed by the Saviour through means of <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> to those qualified for understanding it. This has been done as follows. The thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are indicated (as we have already remarked) by the thirty years during which they say the Saviour performed no public act, and by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the labourers in the vineyard. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, they affirm, very clearly and frequently names these <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, and even goes so far as to preserve their order, when he says, <q>To all the generations of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>.</q>  Nay, we ourselves, when at the giving  of thanks we pronounce the words, <q>To <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> of <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a></q> (for ever and ever), do set forth these <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. And, in fine, wherever the words <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> or <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> occur, they at once refer them to these beings.</p>

<p>2. The production, again, of the Duodecad of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, is indicated by the fact that the Lord was <em>twelve</em> <span class="stiki" id="note012687"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;2:42</a></span> years of age when He disputed with the teachers of the law, and by the election of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, for of these there were twelve. <span class="stiki" id="note012688"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;6:13</a></span> The other eighteen <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are made manifest in this way: that the Lord, [according to them,] conversed with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for eighteen months  after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead. They also affirm that these eighteen <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are strikingly indicated by the first two letters of His name [<span class="greek">&#x1FBF;&#x0399;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C2;</span>], namely <em>Iota</em>  and <em>Eta</em>. And, in like manner, they assert that the ten <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are pointed out by the letter <em>Iota</em>, which begins His name; while, for the same reason, they tell us the Saviour said, <q>One <em>Iota</em>, or one tittle, shall by no means pass away until all be fulfilled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012691"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;5:18</a></span> </p>

<p>3. They further maintain that the passion which took place in the case of the twelfth <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> is pointed at by the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> of Judas, who was the twelfth apostle, and also by the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered in the twelfth month. For their opinion is, that He continued to preach for one year only after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The same thing is also most clearly indicated by the case of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who suffered from an issue of blood. For after she had been thus afflicted during twelve years, she was healed by the advent of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, when she had touched the border of His garment; and on this account the Saviour said, <q>Who touched me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012692"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse31">Mark&nbsp;5:31</a></span> &mdash; teaching his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which had occurred among the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, and the healing of that <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> who had been involved in suffering. For she who had been afflicted twelve years represented that power whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as they narrate, was stretching itself forth, and flowing into immensity; and unless she had touched the garment of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,  that is, Aletheia of the first Tetrad, who is denoted by the hem spoken of, she would have been dissolved into the general <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>  [of which she participated]. She stopped short, however, and ceased any longer to suffer. For the power that went forth from the Son (and this power they term Horos) healed her, and separated the passion from her.</p>

<p>4. They moreover affirm that the Saviour  is shown to be derived from all the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, and to be in Himself <em>everything</em> by the following passage: <q>Every male that opens the womb.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012696"><a href="../bible/exo013.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;13:2</a>; <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;2:23</a></span> For He, being everything, opened the womb  of the enthymesis of the suffering <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, when  it had been expelled from the Pleroma. This they also style the second Ogdoad, of which we shall speak presently. And they state that it was clearly on this account that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <q>And He Himself is all things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012698"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse11">Colossians&nbsp;3:11</a></span> and again, <q>All things are to Him, and of Him are all things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012699"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse36">Romans&nbsp;11:36</a></span> and further, <q>In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012700"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> and yet again, <q>All things are gathered together by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012701"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> Thus do they interpret these and any like passages to be found in Scripture.</p>

<p>5. They show, further, that that Horos of theirs, whom they call by a variety of names, has two faculties,&mdash; the one of supporting, and the other of separating; and in so far as he supports and sustains, he is Stauros, while in so far as he divides and separates, he is Horos. They then represent the Saviour as having indicated this twofold faculty: first, the sustaining power, when He said, <q>Whosoever does not bear his cross (Stauros), and follow after me, cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>;</q>  and again, <q>Taking up the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, follow me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012703"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;10:21</a></span> but the separating power when He said, <q>I came not to send peace, but a sword.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012704"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> They also maintain that John indicated the same thing when he said, <q>The fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge the floor, and will gather the wheat into His garner; but the chaff He will burn with fire unquenchable.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012705"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;3:17</a></span> By this declaration He set forth the faculty of Horos. For that fan they explain to be the cross (Stauros), which consumes, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, all material  objects, as fire does chaff, but it purifies all those who are saved, as a fan does wheat. Moreover, they affirm that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> himself made mention of this cross in the following words: <q>The doctrine of the cross is foolishness to those who perish, but to us who are saved it is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012707"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> And again: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in anything  save in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.</q></p>

<p>6. Such, then, is the account which they all give of their Pleroma, and of the formation  of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, striving, as they do, to adapt the good words of revelation to their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> inventions. And it is not only from the writings of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that they endeavour to derive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for their opinions by means of perverse interpretations and deceitful expositions: they deal in the same way with the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, which contain many <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and allegories that can frequently be drawn into various senses, according to the kind of exegesis to which they are subjected. And others  of them, with great craftiness, adapted such parts of Scripture to their own figments, lead away captive from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> those who do not retain a steadfast <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty, and in one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>
