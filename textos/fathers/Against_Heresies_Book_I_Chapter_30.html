<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 30)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Doctrines of the Ophites and Sethians.</span>

<p>1. Others, again, portentously declare that there exists, in the power of Bythus, a certain primary light, blessed, incorruptible, and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: this is the Father of all, and is styled the first man. They also maintain that his Enn&oelig;a, going forth from him, produced a son, and that this is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>&mdash; the second man. Below these, again, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and under this superior spirit the elements were separated from each other, viz., water, darkness, the abyss, chaos, above which they declare the Spirit was borne, calling him the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Afterwards, they maintain, the first man, with his son, delighting over the beauty of the Spirit&mdash; that is, of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>&mdash; and shedding light upon her, begot by her an incorruptible light, the third male, whom they call Christ,&mdash; the son of the first and second man, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</p>

<p>2. The father and son thus both had intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (whom they also call the mother of the living). When, however,  she could not bear nor receive into herself the greatness of the lights, they declare that she was filled to repletion, and became ebullient on the left side; and that thus their only son Christ, as belonging to the right side, and ever tending to what was higher, was immediately caught up with his mother to form an incorruptible <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>. This constitutes the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has become the appellation, the meeting together, and the union of the father of all, of the first man, of the son, of the second man, of Christ their son, and of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has been mentioned.</p>

<p>3. They teach, however, that the power which proceeded from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by ebullition, being besprinkled with light, fell downward from the place occupied by its progenitors, yet possessing  by its own will that besprinkling of light; and it they call Sinistra, Prunicus, and Sophia, as well as masculo-feminine. This being, in its simplicity, descended into the waters while they were yet in a state of immobility, and imparted motion to them also, wantonly acting upon them even to their lowest depths, and assumed from them a body. For they affirm that all things rushed towards and clung to that sprinkling of light, and begin it all round. Unless it had possessed that, it would perhaps have been totally absorbed in, and overwhelmed by, material substance. Being therefore bound down by a body which was composed of matter, and greatly burdened by it, this power regretted the course it had followed, and made an attempt to escape from the waters and ascend to its mother: it could not effect this, however, on account of the weight of the body lying over and around it. But feeling very ill at ease, it endeavoured at least to conceal that light which came from above, fearing lest it too might be injured by the inferior elements, as had happened to itself. And when it had received power from that besprinkling of light which it possessed, it sprang back again, and was borne aloft; and being on high, it extended itself, covered [a portion of space], and formed this visible heaven out of its body; yet remained under the heaven which it made, as still possessing the form of a watery body. But when it had conceived a desire for the light above, and had received power by all things, it laid down this body, and was freed from it. This body which they speak of that power as having thrown off, they call a female from a female.</p>

<p>4. They declare, moreover, that her son had also himself a certain breath of incorruption left him by his mother, and that through means of it he works; and becoming powerful, he himself, as they affirm, also sent forth from the waters a son without a mother; for they do not allow him either to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> a mother. His son, again, after the example of his father, sent forth another son. This third one, too, generated a fourth; the fourth also generated a son: they maintain that again a son was generated by the fifth; and the sixth, too, generated a seventh. Thus was the Hebdomad, according to them, completed, the mother possessing the eighth place; and as in the case of their generations, so also in regard to dignities and powers, they precede each other in turn.</p>

<p>5. They have also given names to [the several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>] in their system of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, such as the following: he who was the first descendant of the mother is called Ialdabaoth;  he, again, descended from him, is named Iao; he, from this one, is called Sabaoth; the fourth is named Adoneus; the fifth, Eloeus; the sixth, Oreus; and the seventh and last of all, Astanph&aelig;us. Moreover, they represent these heavens, potentates, powers, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and creators, as sitting in their proper order in heaven, according to their generation, and as invisibly ruling over things celestial and terrestrial. The first of them, namely Ialdabaoth, holds his mother in contempt, inasmuch as he produced sons and grandsons without the permission of any one, yea, even <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, archangels, powers, potentates, and dominions. After these things had been done, his sons turned to strive and quarrel with him about the supreme power&mdash;conduct which deeply grieved Ialdabaoth, and drove him to despair. In these circumstances, he cast his eyes upon the subjacent dregs of matter, and fixed his desire upon it, to which they declare his son owes his origin. This son is Nous himself, twisted into the form of a serpent;  and hence were derived the spirit, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and all mundane things: from this too were generated all oblivion, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, emulation, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and death. They declare that the father imparted  still greater crookedness to this serpent-like and contorted Nous of theirs, when he was with their father in heaven and Paradise.</p>

<p>6. On this account, Ialdabaoth, becoming uplifted in spirit, boasted himself over all those things that were below him, and exclaimed, <q>I am father, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and above me there is no one.</q> But his mother, hearing him speak thus, cried out against him, <q>Do not lie, Ialdabaoth: for the father of all, the first Anthropos (man), is above you; and so is Anthropos the son of Anthropos.</q> Then, as all were disturbed by this new voice, and by the unexpected proclamation, and as they were inquiring whence the noise proceeded, in order to lead them away and attract them to himself, they affirm that Ialdabaoth exclaimed, <q>Come, let us make man after our image.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012972"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> The six powers, on hearing this, and their mother furnishing them with the idea of a man (in order that by means of him she might empty them of their original power), jointly formed a man of immense size, both in regard to breadth and length. But as he could merely writhe along the ground, they carried him to their father; Sophia so labouring in this matter, that she might empty him (Ialdabaoth) of the light with which he had been sprinkled, so that he might no longer, though still powerful, be able to lift up himself against the powers above. They declare, then, that by breathing  into man the spirit of life, he was secretly emptied of his power; that hence man became a possessor of nous (intelligence) and enthymesis (thought); and they affirm that these are the faculties which partake in <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. He [they further assert] at once gave thanks to the first Anthropos (man), forsaking those who had created him.</p>

<p>7. But Ialdabaoth, feeling <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> at this, was pleased to form the design of again emptying man by means of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and produced a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from his own enthymesis, whom that Prunicus [above mentioned] laying hold of, imperceptibly emptied her of power. But the others coming and admiring her beauty, named her Eve, and falling in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with her, begot sons by her, whom they also declare to be the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But their mother (Sophia) cunningly devised a scheme to seduce Eve and Adam, by means of the serpent, to transgress the command of Ialdabaoth. Eve listened to this as if it had proceeded from a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, and yielded an easy belief. She also persuaded <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to eat of the tree regarding which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had said that they should not eat of it. They then declare that, on their thus eating, they attained to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that power which is above all, and departed from those who had created them.  When Prunicus perceived that the powers were thus baffled by their own creature, she greatly rejoiced, and again cried out, that since the father was incorruptible, he (Ialdabaoth) who formerly called himself the father was a liar; and that, while Anthropos and the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (the Spirit) <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previously, this one (Eve) <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</p>

<p>8. Ialdabaoth, however, through that oblivion in which he was involved, and not paying any regard to these things, cast <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> out of Paradise, because they had transgressed his commandment. For he had a desire to beget sons by Eve, but did not accomplish his wish, because his mother opposed him in every point, and secretly emptied <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> of the light with which they had been sprinkled, in order that that spirit which proceeded from the supreme power might participate neither in the curse nor opprobrium [caused by transgression]. They also teach that, thus being emptied of the divine substance, they were cursed by him, and cast down from heaven to this world.  But the serpent also, who was acting against the father, was cast down by him into this lower world; he reduced, however, under his power the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> here, and begot six sons, he himself forming the seventh person, after the example of that Hebdomad which surrounds the father. They further declare that these are the seven mundane <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who always oppose and resist the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, because it was on their account that their father was cast down to this lower world.</p>

<p>9. <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> previously had light, and clear, and as it were spiritual bodies, such as they were at their creation; but when they came to this world, these changed into bodies more opaque, and gross, and sluggish. Their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also was feeble and languid, inasmuch as they had received from their creator a merely mundane inspiration. This continued until Prunicus, moved with compassion towards them, restored to them the sweet savour of the besprinkling of light, by means of which they came to a remembrance of themselves, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they were naked, as well as that the body was a material substance, and thus recognised that they bore death about with them. They thereupon became patient, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that only for a time they would be enveloped in the body. They also found out food, through the guidance of Sophia; and when they were satisfied, they had carnal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of each other, and begot Cain, whom the serpent, that had been cast down along with his sons, immediately laid hold of and destroyed by filling him with mundane oblivion, and urging into folly and audacity, so that, by slaying his brother Abel, he was the first to bring to light <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and death. After these, they affirm that, by the forethought of Prunicus, Seth was begotten, and then Norea,  from whom they represent all the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> as being descended. They were urged on to all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by the inferior Hebdomad, and to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and a general contempt for everything by the superior <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hebdomad,  since the mother was always secretly opposed to them, and carefully preserved what was peculiarly her own, that is, the besprinkling of light. They maintain, moreover, that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hebdomad is the seven stars which they call planets; and they affirm that the serpent cast down has two names, Michael and Samael.</p>

<p>10. Ialdabaoth, again, being incensed with men, because they did not worship or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as father and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sent forth a deluge upon them, that he might at once destroy them all. But Sophia opposed him in this point also, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were saved in the ark by means of the besprinkling of that light which proceeded from her, and through it the world was again filled with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Ialdabaoth himself chose a certain man named <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> from among these, and made a covenant with him, to the effect that, if his seed continued to serve him, he would give to them the earth for an inheritance. Afterwards, by means of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he  brought forth <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> descendants from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and gave them the law, and made them the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Among that people he chose seven days,  which they also call the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hebdomad. Each of these receives his own herald for the purpose of glorifying and proclaiming <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that, when the rest hear these praises, they too may serve those who are announced as gods by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<p>11. Moreover, they distribute the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the following manner: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Joshua the son of Nun, and Amos, and Habakkuk, belonged to Ialdabaoth; Samuel, and Nathan, and Jonah, and Micah, to Iao; Elijah, Joel, and Zechariah to Sabaoth; Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel, to Adonai; Tobias and Haggai to Eloi; Michaiah and Nahum to Oreus; Esdras and Zephaniah to Astanph&aelig;us. Each one of these, then, glorifies his own father and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they maintain that Sophia, herself has also spoken many things through them regarding the first Anthropos (man),  and concerning that Christ who is above, thus admonishing and reminding men of the incorruptible light, the first Anthropos, and of the descent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The [other] powers being terrified by these things, and marvelling at the novelty of those things which were announced by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, Prunicus brought it about by means of Ialdabaoth (who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what he did), that emissions of two men took place, the one from the barren <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>, and the other from the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>12. And since she herself had no rest either in heaven or on earth, she invoked her mother to assist her in her distress. Upon this, her mother, the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was moved with compassion towards her daughter, on her repentance, and begged from the first man that Christ should be sent to her assistance, who, being sent forth, descended to his sister, and to the besprinkling of light. When he recognised her (that is, the Sophia below), her brother descended to her, and announced his advent through means of John, and prepared the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of repentance, and adopted Jesus beforehand, in order that on Christ descending he might find a pure vessel, and that by the son of that Ialdabaoth the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> might be announced by Christ. They further declare that he descended through the seven heavens, having assumed the likeness of their sons, and gradually emptied them of their power. For they maintain that the whole besprinkling of light rushed to him, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, descending to this world, first clothed his sister Sophia [with it], and that then both exulted in the mutual refreshment they felt in each other's society: this scene they describe as relating to bridegroom and bride. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, inasmuch as he was begotten of the Virgin through the agency of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was wiser, purer, and more righteous than all other men: Christ united to Sophia descended into him, and thus <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was produced.</p>

<p>13. They affirm that many of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were not aware of the descent of Christ into him; but that, when Christ did descend on Jesus, he then began to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and heal, and announce the unknown Father, and openly to confess himself the son of the first man. The powers and the father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at these proceedings, and laboured to destroy him; and when he was being led away for this purpose, they say that Christ himself, along with Sophia, departed from him into the state of an incorruptible <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, while Jesus was crucified. Christ, however, was not forgetful of his Jesus, but sent down a certain energy into him from above, which raised him up again in the body, which they call both animal and spiritual; for he sent the mundane parts back again into the world. When his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> saw that he had risen, they did not recognise him&mdash; no, not even Jesus himself, by whom he rose again from the dead. And they assert that this very great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> prevailed among his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they imagined he had risen in a mundane body, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <q>flesh  and blood do not attain to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q></p>

<p>14. They strove to establish the descent and ascent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by the fact that neither before his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, nor after his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>, do his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> state that he did any mighty works, not being aware that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was united to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the incorruptible <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> to the Hebdomad; and they declare his mundane body to be of the same nature as that of animals. But after his resurrection he tarried [on earth] eighteen months; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> descending into him from above, he taught what was clear. He instructed a few of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be capable of understanding so great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, in these things, and was then received up into heaven, Christ sitting down at the right hand of his father Ialdabaoth, that he may receive to himself the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> them,  after they have laid aside their mundane flesh, thus enriching himself without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or perception of his father; so that, in proportion as Jesus enriches himself with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to such an extent does his father suffer loss and is diminished, being emptied of his own power by these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For he will not now possess <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to send them down again into  the world, except those only which are of his substance, that is, those into which he has breathed. But the consummation [of all things] will take place, when the whole besprinkling of the spirit of light is gathered together, and is carried off to form an incorruptible <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>.</p>

<p>15. Such are the opinions which prevail among these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, by whom, like the Lern&aelig;an hydra, a many-headed beast has been generated from the school of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>. For some of them assert that Sophia herself became the serpent; on which account she was hostile to the creator of Adam, and implanted <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in men, for which reason the serpent was called wiser than all others. Moreover, by the position of our intestines, through which the food is conveyed, and by the fact that they possess such a figure, our internal configuration  in the form of a serpent reveals our hidden generatrix.</p>
