<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Chapter 31)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Doctrines of the Cainites.</span>

<p>1. Others again declare that Cain derived his being from the Power above, and acknowledge that <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, Korah, the Sodomites, and all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, are related to themselves. On this account, they add, they have been assailed by the Creator, yet no one of them has suffered injury. For Sophia was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of carrying off that which belonged to her from them to herself. They declare that Judas the traitor was thoroughly acquainted with these things, and that he alone, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as no others did, accomplished the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the betrayal; by him all things, both earthly and heavenly, were thus thrown into confusion. They produce a fictitious history of this kind, which they style the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Judas.</p>

<p>2. I have also made a collection of their writings in which they advocate the abolition of the doings of Hystera.  Moreover, they call this Hystera the creator of heaven and earth. They also hold, like Carpocrates, that men cannot be saved until they have gone through all kinds of experience. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, they maintain, attends them in every one of their sinful and abominable actions, and urges them to venture on audacity and incur pollution. Whatever may be the nature  of the action, they declare that they do it in the name of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, saying, <q>O you <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, I use your work; O you power, I accomplish your operation!</q> And they maintain that this is <q>perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> without shrinking to rush into such actions as it is not lawful even to name.</p>

<p>3. It was necessary clearly to prove, that, as their very opinions and regulations exhibit them, those who are of the school of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> derive their origin from such mothers, fathers, and ancestors, and also to bring forward their doctrines, with the hope that perchance some of them, exercising repentance and returning to the only Creator, and God the Former of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, may obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and that others may not henceforth be drawn away by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, although plausible, persuasions, imagining that they will obtain from them the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of some greater and more sublime <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. But let them rather, learning to good effect from us the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> tenets of these men, look with contempt upon their doctrines, while at the same time they pity those who, still cleaving to these miserable and baseless fables, have reached such a pitch of arrogance as to reckon themselves superior to all others on account of such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or, as it should rather be called, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. They have now been fully exposed; and simply to exhibit their sentiments, is to obtain a victory over them.</p>

<p>4. Wherefore I have laboured to bring forward, and make clearly manifest, the utterly ill-conditioned carcass of this miserable little fox. <span class="stiki" id="note012984"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse15">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:15</a>; <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;13:32</a>.</span> For there will not now be need of many words to overturn their system of doctrine, when it has been made manifest to all. It is as when, on a beast hiding itself in a wood, and by rushing forth from it is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of destroying multitudes, one who beats round the wood and thoroughly explores it, so as to compel the animal to break cover, does not strive to capture it, seeing that it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a ferocious beast; but those present can then watch and avoid its assaults, and can cast darts at it from all sides, and wound it, and finally slay that destructive brute. So, in our case, since we have brought their hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, which they keep in silence among themselves, to the light, it will not now be necessary to use many words in destroying their system of opinions. For it is now in your power, and in the power of all your associates, to familiarize yourselves with what has been said, to overthrow their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and undigested doctrines, and to set forth doctrines agreeable to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Since then the case is so, I shall, according to promise, and as my ability serves, labour to overthrow them, by refuting them all in the following book. Even to give an account of them is a tedious affair, as you see.  But I shall furnish means for overthrowing them, by meeting all their opinions in the order in which they have been described, that I may not only expose the wild beast to view, but may inflict wounds upon it from every side.</p>
