<h1>Against Heresies (Book I, Preface)</h1>


<p>1. Inasmuch  as certain men have set the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> aside, and bring in <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> words and vain genealogies, which, as the apostle says,  <q>minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> and by means of their craftily-constructed plausibilities draw away the minds of the inexperienced and take them captive, [I have felt constrained, my dear friend, to compose the following treatise in order to expose and counteract their machinations.] These men falsify the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and prove themselves <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> interpreters of the good word of revelation. They also overthrow the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of many, by drawing them away, under a pretence of [superior] <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, from Him who rounded and adorned the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; as if, forsooth, they had something more excellent and sublime to reveal, than that God who created the heaven and the earth, and all things that are therein. By means of specious and plausible words, they cunningly allure the simple-minded to inquire into their system; but they nevertheless clumsily destroy them, while they initiate them into their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and impious opinions respecting the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>;  and these simple ones are unable, even in such a matter, to distinguish <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>2. Error, indeed, is never set forth in its naked deformity, lest, being thus exposed, it should at once be detected. But it is craftily decked out in an attractive dress, so as, by its outward form, to make it appear to the inexperienced (ridiculous as the expression may seem) more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. One  far superior to me has well said, in reference to this point, <q>A clever imitation in glass casts contempt, as it were, on that precious jewel the emerald (which is most highly esteemed by some), unless it come under the eye of one able to test and expose the counterfeit. Or, again, what inexperienced person can with ease detect the presence of brass when it has been mixed up with silver?</q> Lest, therefore, through my neglect, some should be carried off, even as sheep are by wolves, while they perceive not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of these men,&mdash; because they outwardly are covered with sheep's clothing (against whom the Lord has enjoined <span class="stiki" id="note012659"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> us to be on our guard), and because their language resembles ours, while their sentiments are very different&mdash;I have deemed it my duty (after reading some of the <em>Commentaries</em>, as they call them, of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and after making myself acquainted with their tenets through personal intercourse with some of them) to unfold to you, my friend, these portentous and profound <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, which do not fall within the range of every <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, because all have not sufficiently purged  their brains. I do this, in order that you, obtaining an acquaintance with these things, may in turn explain them to all those with whom you are connected, and exhort them to avoid such an abyss of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I intend, then, to the best of my ability, with brevity and clearness to set forth the opinions of those who are now  promulgating <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. I refer especially to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Ptolem&aelig;us, whose school may be described as a bud from that of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>. I shall also endeavour, according to my moderate ability, to furnish the means of overthrowing them, by showing how absurd and inconsistent with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are their statements. Not that I am practised either in composition or eloquence; but my feeling of affection prompts me to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you and all your companions those doctrines which have been kept in concealment until now, but which are at last, through the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, brought to light. <q>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed, nor secret that shall not be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012661"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;10:26</a></span> </p>

<p>3. You will not expect from me, who am resident among the Kelt&aelig;,  and am accustomed for the most part to use a barbarous dialect, any display of rhetoric, which I have never learned, or any excellence of composition, which I have never practised, or any beauty and persuasiveness of style, to which I make no pretensions. But you will accept in a kindly spirit what I in a like spirit write to you simply, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a>, and in my own homely way; while you yourself (as being more capable than I am) will expand those ideas of which I send you, as it were, only the seminal principles; and in the comprehensiveness of your understanding, will develop to their full extent the points on which I briefly touch, so as to set with power before your companions those things which I have uttered in weakness. In fine, as I (to gratify your long-cherished desire for information regarding the tenets of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>) have spared no pains, not only to make these doctrines <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, but also to furnish the means of showing their falsity; so shall you, according to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given to you by the Lord, prove an earnest and efficient minister to others, that men may no longer be drawn away by the plausible system of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, which I now proceed to describe. </p>
