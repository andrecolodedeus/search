<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 10)</h1>

<span class="h1a">By a comparison drawn from the wild olive-tree, whose quality but not whose nature is changed by grafting, he proves more important things; he points out also that man without the Spirit is not capable of bringing forth fruit, or of inheriting the kingdom of God.</span>

<p>1. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, therefore, [he declares], in order that we may not reject the engrafting of the Spirit while pampering the flesh. <q>But you, being a wild olive-tree,</q> he says, <q>have been grafted into the good olive-tree, and been made a partaker of the fatness of the olive-tree.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014512"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;11:17</a></span> As, therefore, when the wild olive has been engrafted, if it remain in its former condition, viz., a wild olive, it is <q>cut off, and cast into the fire;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014513"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;7:19</a></span> but if it takes kindly to the graft, and is changed into the good olive-tree, it becomes a fruit-bearing olive, planted, as it were, in a king's park (<em>paradiso</em>): so likewise men, if they do <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> progress by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards better things, and receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and bring forth the fruit thereof, shall be spiritual, as being planted in the paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if they cast out the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and remain in their former condition, desirous of being of the flesh rather than of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, then it is very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> said with regard to men of this stamp, <q>That flesh and blood shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014514"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse50">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:50</a></span> just as if any one were to say that the wild olive is not received into the paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Admirably therefore does the apostle exhibit our nature, and God's universal appointment, in his discourse about flesh and blood and the wild olive. For as the good olive, if neglected for a certain time, if left to grow wild and to run to wood, does itself become a wild olive; or again, if the wild olive be carefully tended and grafted, it naturally reverts to its former fruit-bearing condition: so men also, when they become careless, and bring forth for fruit the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh like woody produce, are rendered, by their own fault, unfruitful in righteousness. For when men sleep, the enemy sows the material of tares; <span class="stiki" id="note014515"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;13:25</a></span> and for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> did the Lord command His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to be on the watch.  And again, those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are not bringing forth the fruits of righteousness, and are, as it were, covered over and lost among brambles, if they use diligence, and receive the word of God as a graft, <span class="stiki" id="note014517"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse21">James&nbsp;1:21</a></span> arrive at the pristine nature of man&mdash; that which was created after the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. But as the engrafted wild olive does not certainly lose the substance of its wood, but changes the quality of its fruit, and receives another name, being now not a wild olive, but a fruit-bearing olive, and is called so; so also, when man is grafted in by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and receives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, he certainly does not lose the substance of flesh, but changes the quality of the fruit [brought forth, i.e.,] of his works, and receives another name, <span class="stiki" id="note014518"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse17">Revelation&nbsp;2:17</a></span> showing that he has become changed for the better, being now not [mere] flesh and blood, but a spiritual man, and is called such. Then, again, as the wild olive, if it be not grafted in, remains useless to its lord because of its woody quality, and is cut down as a tree bearing no fruit, and cast into the fire; so also man, if he does not receive through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the engrafting of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, remains in his old condition, and being [mere] flesh and blood, he cannot inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Rightly therefore does the apostle declare, <q>Flesh and blood cannot inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014519"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse50">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:50</a></span> and, <q>Those who are in the flesh cannot please God:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014520"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;8:8</a></span> not repudiating [by these words] the substance of flesh, but showing that into it the Spirit must be infused.  And for this reason, he says, <q>This mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and this corruptible must put on incorruption.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014522"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> And again he declares, <q>But you are not in the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if so be that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwell in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014523"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;8:9</a></span> He sets this forth still more plainly, where he says, <q>The body indeed is dead, because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but the Spirit is life, because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because of His Spirit dwelling in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014524"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;8:10</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And again he says, in the Epistle to the Romans, <q>For if you live after the flesh, you shall die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014525"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;8:13</a></span> [Now by these words] he does not prohibit them from living their lives in the flesh, for he was himself in the flesh when he wrote to them; but he cuts away the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, those which bring death upon a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And for this reason he says in continuation, <q>But if you through the Spirit do mortify the works of the flesh, you shall live. For whosoever are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, these are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>
