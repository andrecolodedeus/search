<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 12)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Of the difference between life and death; of the breath of life and the vivifying Spirit: also how it is that the substance of flesh revives which once was dead.</span>

<p>1. For as the flesh is capable of corruption, so is it also of incorruption; and as it is of death, so is it also of life. These two do mutually give way to each other; and both cannot remain in the same place, but one is driven out by the other, and the presence of the one destroys that of the other. If, then, when death takes possession of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it drives life away from him, and proves him to be dead, much more does life, when it has obtained power over the man, drive out death, and restore him as living unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if death brings mortality, why should not life, when it comes, vivify man? Just as Esaias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Death devoured when it had prevailed.</q>  And again, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has wiped away every tear from every face.</q> Thus that former life is expelled, because it was not given by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but by the breath.</p>

<p>2. For the breath of life, which also rendered man an animated being, is one thing, and the vivifying Spirit another, which also caused him to become spiritual. And for this reason Isaiah said, <q>Thus says the Lord, who made heaven and established it, who founded the earth and the things therein, and gave breath to the people  upon it, and Spirit to those walking upon it;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014532"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;42:5</a></span> thus telling us that breath is indeed given in common to all people upon earth, but that the Spirit is theirs alone who tread down earthly desires. And therefore Isaiah himself, distinguishing the things already mentioned, again exclaims, <q>For the Spirit shall go forth from Me, and I have made every breath.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014533"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;57:16</a></span> Thus does he attribute the Spirit as peculiar to God which in the last times He pours forth upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> by the adoption of sons; but [he shows] that breath was common throughout the creation, and points it out as something created. Now what has been made is a different thing from him who makes it. The breath, then, is temporal, but the Spirit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. The breath, too, increases [in strength] for a short period, and continues for a certain time; after that it takes its departure, leaving its former abode destitute of breath. But when the Spirit pervades the man within and without, inasmuch as it continues there, it never leaves him. <q>But that is not first which is spiritual,</q> says the apostle, speaking this as if with reference to us <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings; <q>but that is first which is animal, afterwards that which is spiritual,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014534"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:46</a></span> in accordance with reason. For there had been a necessity that, in the first place, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being should be fashioned, and that what was fashioned should receive the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; afterwards that it should thus receive the communion of the Spirit. Wherefore also <q>the first <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made</q> by the Lord <q>a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the second <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> a quickening spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014535"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse45">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:45</a></span> As, then, he who was made a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> forfeited life when he turned aside to what was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, so, on the other hand, the same individual, when he reverts to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and receives the quickening Spirit, shall find life.</p>

<p>3. For it is not one thing which dies and another which is quickened, as neither is it one thing which is lost and another which is found, but the Lord came seeking for that same sheep which had been lost. What was it, then, which was dead? Undoubtedly it was the substance of the flesh; the same, too, which had lost the breath of life, and had become breathless and dead. This same, therefore, was what the Lord came to quicken, that as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> we do all die, as being of an animal nature, in Christ we may all live, as being spiritual, not laying aside God's handiwork, but the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, and receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; as the apostle says in the Epistle to the Colossians: <q>Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the earth.</q> And what these are he himself explains: <q>Fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence; and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014536"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> The laying aside of these is what the apostle preaches; and he declares that those who do such things, as being merely flesh and blood, cannot inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. For their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, tending towards what is worse, and descending to earthly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, has become a partaker in the same designation which belongs to these [<a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, viz., <q>earthly</q>], which, when the apostle commands us to lay aside, he says in the same Epistle, <q>Cast off the old man with his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014537"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;3:9</a></span> But when he said this, he does not remove away the ancient formation [of man]; for in that case it would be incumbent on us to rid ourselves of its company by committing suicide.</p>

<p>4. But the apostle himself also, being one who had been formed in a womb, and had issued thence, wrote to us, and confessed in his Epistle to the Philippians that <q>to live in the flesh was the fruit of [his] work;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014538"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse22">Philippians&nbsp;1:22</a></span> thus expressing himself. Now the final result of the work of the Spirit is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the flesh.  For what other visible fruit is there of the invisible Spirit, than the rendering of the flesh mature and capable of incorruption? If then [he says], <q>To live in the flesh, this is the result of labour to me,</q> he did not surely contemn the substance of flesh in that passage where he said, <q>Put off the old man with his works;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014540"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse10">Colossians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> but he points out that we should lay aside our former conversation, that which waxes old and becomes corrupt; and for this reason he goes on to say, <q>And put on the new man, that which is renewed in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, after the image of Him who created him.</q> In this, therefore, that he says, <q>which is renewed in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> he demonstrates that he, the selfsame man who was in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in times past, that is, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is renewed by that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which has respect to Him. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God renews man. And when he says, <q>after the image of the Creator,</q> he sets forth the recapitulation of the same man, who was at the beginning made after the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>5. And that he, the apostle, was the very same person who had been born from the womb, that is, of the ancient substance of flesh, he does himself declare in the Epistle to the Galatians: <q>But when it pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014541"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse15">Galatians&nbsp;1:15-16</a></span> it was not, as I have already observed, one person who had  been born from the womb, and another who preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; but that same individual who formerly was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and used to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when the revelation was made to him from heaven, and the Lord conferred with him, as I have pointed out in the third book,  preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, his former <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> being driven out by his subsequent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: just as the blind men whom the Lord healed did certainly lose their blindness, but received the substance of their eyes perfect, and obtained the power of vision in the very same eyes with which they formerly did not see; the darkness being merely driven away by the power of vision, while the substance of the eyes was retained, in order that, by means of those eyes through which they had not seen, exercising again the visual power, they might give thanks to Him who had restored them again to sight. And thus, also, he whose withered hand was healed, and all who were healed generally, did not change those parts of their bodies which had at their birth come forth from the womb, but simply obtained these anew in a healthy condition.</p>

<p>6. For the Maker of all things, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who did also from the beginning form man, when He found His handiwork impaired by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, performed upon it all kinds of healing. At one time [He did so], as regards each separate member, as it is found in His own handiwork; and at another time He did once for all restore man sound and whole in all points, preparing him perfect for Himself unto the resurrection. For what was His object in healing [different] portions of the flesh, and restoring them to their original condition, if those parts which had been healed by Him were not in a position to obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? For if it was [merely] a temporary benefit which He conferred, He granted nothing of importance to those who were the subjects of His healing. Or how can they maintain that the flesh is incapable of receiving the life which flows from Him, when it received healing from Him? For life is brought about through healing, and incorruption through life. He, therefore, who confers healing, the same does also confer life; and He [who gives] life, also surrounds His own handiwork with incorruption.</p>
