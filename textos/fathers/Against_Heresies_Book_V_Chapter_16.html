<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 16)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Since our bodies return to the earth, it follows that they have their substance from it; also, by the advent of the Word, the image of God in us appeared in a clearer light.</span>

<p>1. And since <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was moulded from this earth to which we belong, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells us that God said to him, <q>In the sweat of your face shall you eat your bread, until you turn again to the dust from whence you were taken.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014588"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> If then, after death, our bodies return to any other substance, it follows that from it also they have their substance. But if it be into this very [earth], it is manifest that it was also from it that man's frame was created; as also the Lord clearly showed, when from this very substance He formed eyes for the man [to whom He gave sight]. And thus was the hand of God plainly shown forth, by which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was fashioned, and we too have been formed; and since there is one and the same Father, whose voice from the beginning even to the end is present with His handiwork, and the substance from which we were formed is plainly declared through the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, we should therefore not seek after another Father besides Him, nor [look for] another substance from which we have been formed, besides what was mentioned beforehand, and shown forth by the Lord; nor another hand of God besides that which, from the beginning even to the end, forms us and prepares us for life, and is present with His handiwork, and perfects it after the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. And then, again, this Word was manifested when the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was made man, assimilating Himself to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and man to Himself, so that by means of his resemblance to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, man might become precious to the Father. For in times long past, it was <em>said</em> that man was created after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but it was not [actually] <em>shown</em>; for the Word was as yet invisible, after whose image man was created, Wherefore also he did easily lose the similitude. When, however, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> became flesh, He confirmed both these: for He both showed forth the image <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, since He became Himself what was His image; and He re-established the similitude after a sure manner, by assimilating man to the invisible Father through means of the visible Word.</p>

<p>3. And not by the aforesaid things alone has the Lord manifested Himself, but [He has done this] also by means of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. For doing away with [the effects of] that disobedience of man which had taken place at the beginning by the occasion of a tree, <q>He became <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even the death of the cross;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014589"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> rectifying that disobedience which had occurred by reason of a tree, through that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> which was [wrought out] upon the tree [of the cross]. Now He would not have come to do away, by means of that same [image], the disobedience which had been incurred towards our Maker if He proclaimed another Father. But inasmuch as it was by these things that we disobeyed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and did not give credit to His word, so was it also by these same that He brought in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and consent as respects His Word; by which things He clearly shows forth God Himself, whom indeed we had offended in the first Adam, when he did not perform His commandment. In the second Adam, however, we are reconciled, being made <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death. For we were debtors to none other but to Him whose commandment we had transgressed at the beginning.</p>
