<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 17)</h1>

<span class="h1a">There is but one Lord and one God, the Father and Creator of all things, who has loved us in Christ, given us commandments, and remitted our sins; whose Son and Word Christ proved Himself to be, when He forgave our sins.</span>

<p>1. Now this being is the Creator (<em>Demiurgus</em>), who is, in respect of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the Father; but in respect of His power, He is Lord; and in respect of His wisdom, our Maker and Fashioner; by transgressing whose commandment we became His enemies. And therefore in the last times the Lord has restored us into friendship through His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, having become <q>the Mediator between God and men;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014590"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> propitiating indeed for us the Father against whom we had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and cancelling (<em>consolatus</em>) our disobedience by His own <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; conferring also upon us the gift of communion with, and subjection to, our Maker. For this reason also He has taught us to say in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>And forgive us our debts;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014591"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> since indeed He is our Father, whose debtors we were, having transgressed His commandments. But who is this Being? Is He some unknown one, and a Father who gives no commandment  to any one? Or is He the God who is proclaimed in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, to whom we were debtors, having transgressed His commandment? Now the commandment was given to man by the Word. For Adam, it is said, <q>heard the voice of the Lord God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014592"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;3:8</a></span> Rightly then does His Word say to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014593"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;9:2</a>; <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;5:20</a></span> He, the same against whom we had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the beginning, grants forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the end. But if indeed we had disobeyed the command of any other, while it was a different being who said, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014594"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;9:2</a>; <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;5:20</a></span> such an one is neither good, nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, nor just. For how can he be good, who does not give from what belongs to himself? Or how can he be just, who snatches away the goods of another? And in what way can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> remitted, unless that He against whom we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> has Himself granted remission <q>through the bowels of mercy of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> in which <q>He has visited us</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014595"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse78">Luke&nbsp;1:78</a></span> through His Son?</p>

<p>2. And therefore, when He had healed the man sick of the palsy, [the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>] says <q>The people upon seeing it <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gave such power unto men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014596"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;9:8</a></span> What <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, did the bystanders glorify? Was it indeed that unknown Father invented by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>? And how could they glorify him who was altogether unknown to them? It is evident, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him who has been proclaimed as God by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who is also the Father of our Lord; and therefore He taught men, by the evidence of their senses through those signs which He accomplished, to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If, however, He Himself had come from another Father, and men <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> a different Father when they beheld His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, He [in that case] rendered them ungrateful to that Father who had sent the gift of healing. But as the only-begotten Son had come for man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from Him who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He did both stir up the incredulous by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of working, to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Father; and to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who did not admit the advent of His Son, and who consequently did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the remission [of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>] which was conferred by Him, He said, <q>That you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014597"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;9:6</a></span> And when He had said this, He commanded the paralytic man to take up the pallet upon which he was lying, and go into his house. By this work of His He confounded the unbelievers, and showed that He is Himself the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which man received commandments, which he broke, and became a sinner; for the paralysis followed as a consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>3. Therefore, by remitting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He did indeed heal man, while He also manifested Himself who He was. For if no one can forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> but God alone, while the Lord remitted them and healed men, it is plain that He was Himself the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, receiving from the Father the power of remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; since He was man, and since He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that since as man He suffered for us, so as God He might have compassion on us, and forgive us our debts, in which we were made debtors to God our Creator. And therefore David said beforehand, <q>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q>  pointing out thus that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which follows upon His advent, by which <q>He has destroyed the handwriting</q> of our debt, and <q>fastened it to the cross;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014599"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse14">Colossians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> so that as by means of a tree we were made debtors to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, [so also] by means of a tree we may obtain the remission of our debt.</p>

<p>4. This fact has been strikingly set forth by many others, and especially through means of Elisha the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. For when his fellow <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were hewing wood for the construction of a tabernacle, and when the iron [head], shaken loose from the axe, had fallen into the Jordan and could not be found by them, upon Elisha's coming to the place, and learning what had happened, he threw some wood into the water. Then, when he had done this, the iron part of the axe floated up, and they took up from the surface of the water what they had previously lost. <span class="stiki" id="note014600"><a href="../bible/2ki006.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;6:6</a></span> By this action the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> pointed out that the sure word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which we had negligently lost by means of a tree, and were not in the way of finding again, we should receive anew by the dispensation of a tree, [viz., the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>]. For that the word of God is likened to an axe, John the Baptist declares [when he says] in reference to it, <q>But now also is the axe laid to the root of the trees.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014601"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> Jeremiah also says to the same purport: <q>The word of God cleaves the rock as an axe.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014602"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse29">Jeremiah&nbsp;23:29</a></span> This word, then, what was hidden from us, did the dispensation of the tree make manifest, as I have already remarked. For as we lost it by means of a tree, by means of a tree again was it made manifest to all, showing the height, the length, the breadth, the depth in itself; and, as a certain man among our predecessors observed, <q>Through the extension of the hands of a divine person,  gathering together the two peoples to one God.</q>  For these were two hands, because there were two peoples scattered to the ends of the earth; but there was one head in the middle, as there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.</p>
