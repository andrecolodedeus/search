<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 19)</h1>

<span class="h1a">A comparison is instituted between the disobedient and sinning Eve and the Virgin Mary, her patroness. Various and discordant heresies are mentioned.</span>

<p>1. That the Lord then was manifestly coming to His own things, and was sustaining them by means of that creation which is supported by Himself, and was making a recapitulation of that disobedience which had occurred in connection with a tree, through the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> which was [exhibited by Himself when He hung] upon a tree, [the effects] also of that deception being done away with, by which that virgin Eve, who was already espoused to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was unhappily misled&mdash;was happily announced, through means of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> [spoken] by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, who was [also espoused] to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.  For just as the former was led astray by the word of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, so that she fled from God when she had transgressed His word; so did the latter, by an angelic communication, receive the glad tidings that she should sustain (<em>portaret</em>) <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to His word. And if the former did disobey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet the latter was persuaded to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that the Virgin Mary might become the patroness  (<em>advocata</em>) of the virgin Eve. And thus, as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> fell into bondage to death by means of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, so is it rescued by a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; virginal disobedience having been balanced in the opposite scale by virginal <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. For in the same way the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first created man (<em>protoplasti</em>) receives amendment by the correction of the First-begotten, and the coming of the serpent is conquered by the harmlessness of the dove, those bonds being unloosed by which we had been fast bound to death.</p>

<p>2. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> being all unlearned and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's arrangements, and not acquainted with that dispensation by which He took upon Him <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (<em>inscii ejus qu&aelig; est secundum hominem dispensationis</em>), inasmuch as they blind themselves with regard to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, do in fact speak against their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Some of them introduce another Father besides the Creator; some, again, say that the world and its substance was made by certain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; certain others [maintain] that it was widely separated by Horos  from him whom they represent as being the Father&mdash; that it sprang forth (<em>floruisse</em>) of itself, and from itself was born. Then, again, others [of them assert] that it obtained substance in those things which are contained by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from defect and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; others still, despise the advent of the Lord manifest [to the senses], for they do not admit His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>; while others, ignoring the arrangement [that He should be born] of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, maintain that He was begotten by Joseph. And still further, some affirm that neither their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nor their body can receive <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, but merely the inner man. Moreover, they will have it that this [inner man] is that which is the understanding (<em>sensum</em>) in them, and which they decree as being the only thing to ascend to <q>the perfect.</q> Others [maintain], as I have said in the first book, that while the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is saved, their body does not participate in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in which [book] I have also set forward the hypotheses of all these men, and in the second have pointed out their weakness and inconsistency.</p>
