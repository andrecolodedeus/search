<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 20)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Those pastors are to be heard to whom the apostles committed the Churches, possessing one and the same doctrine of salvation; the heretics, on the other hand, are to be avoided. We must think soberly with regard to the mysteries of the faith.</span>

<p>1. Now all these [<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>] are of much later date than the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> committed the Churches; which fact I have in the third book taken all pains to demonstrate. It follows, then, as a matter of course, that these  <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> aforementioned, since they are blind to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and deviate from the [right] way, will walk in various roads; and therefore the footsteps of their doctrine are scattered here and there without agreement or connection. But the path of those belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> circumscribes the whole world, as possessing the sure tradition from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and gives unto us to see that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all is one and the same, since all receive one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the same dispensation regarding the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and are cognizant of the same gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and are conversant with the same commandments, and preserve the same form of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> constitution,  and expect the same advent of the Lord, and await the same <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the complete man, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. And undoubtedly the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and steadfast,  in which one and the same way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is shown throughout the whole world. For to her is entrusted the light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore the <q>wisdom</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by means of which she saves all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <q>is declared in [its] going forth; it utters [its voice] faithfully in the streets, is preached on the tops of the walls, and speaks continually in the gates of the city.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014621"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse20">Proverbs&nbsp;1:20-21</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> preaches the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> everywhere, and she is the seven-branched candlestick which bears the light of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>2. Those, therefore, who desert the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, call in question the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, not taking into consideration of how much greater consequence is a religious man, even in a private station, than a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and impudent sophist.  Now, such are all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and those who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they have hit upon something more beyond the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so that by following those things already mentioned, proceeding on their way variously, inharmoniously, and foolishly, not keeping always to the same opinions with regard to the same things, as blind men are led by the blind, they shall deservedly fall into the ditch of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> lying in their path, ever seeking and never finding out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note014623"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:7</a></span> It behooves us, therefore, to avoid their doctrines, and to take careful heed lest we suffer any injury from them; but to flee to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and be brought up in her bosom, and be nourished with the Lord's Scriptures. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been planted as a garden (<em>paradisus</em>) in this world; therefore says the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, <q>You may freely eat from every tree of the garden,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014624"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;2:16</a></span> that is, Eat from every Scripture of the Lord; but you shall not eat with an uplifted <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nor touch any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> discord. For these men do profess that they have themselves the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and they set their own impious minds above the God who made them. They therefore form opinions on what is beyond the limits of the understanding. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also the apostle says, <q>Be not wise beyond what it is fitting to be wise, but be wise prudently,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014625"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;12:3</a></span> that we be not cast forth by eating of the <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> of these men (that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> more than it should do) from the paradise of life. Into this paradise the Lord has introduced those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His call, <q>summing up in Himself all things which are in heaven, and which are on earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014626"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> but the things in heaven are spiritual, while those on earth constitute the dispensation in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (<em>secundum hominem est dispositio</em>). These things, therefore, He recapitulated in Himself: by uniting man to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and causing the Spirit to dwell in man, He is Himself made the head of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and gives the Spirit to be the head of man: for through Him (the Spirit) we see, and hear, and speak.</p>
