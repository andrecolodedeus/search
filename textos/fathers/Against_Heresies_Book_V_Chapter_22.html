<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 22)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The true Lord and the one God is declared by the law, and manifested by Christ His Son in the Gospel; whom alone we should adore, and from Him we must look for all good things, not from Satan.</span>

<p>1. Thus then does the Lord plainly show that it was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord and the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> who had been set forth by the law; for Him whom the law proclaimed as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the same did Christ point out as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, whom also it behooves the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Christ alone to serve. By means of the statements of the law, He put our adversary to utter confusion; and the law directs us to praise God the Creator (<em>Demiurgum</em>), and to serve Him alone. Since this is the case, we must not seek for another Father besides Him, or above Him, since there is one God who justifies the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the uncircumcision through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note014640"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;3:30</a></span> For if there were any other perfect Father above Him, He (Christ) would by no means have overthrown <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> by means of His words and commandments. For one <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> cannot be done away with by means of another <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, any more than one defect by another defect. If, therefore, the law is due to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and defect, how could the statements contained therein bring to nought the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and conquer the strong man? For a strong man can be conquered neither by an inferior nor by an equal, but by one possessed of greater power. But the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is the superior above all, He who is loudly proclaimed in the law: <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>;</q> and, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart;</q> and, <q>Him shall you adore, and Him alone shall you serve.</q>  Then in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, casting down the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> by means of these expressions, He did both overcome the strong man by His Father's voice, and He acknowledges the commandment of the law to express His own sentiments, when He says, <q>You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014642"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;4:7</a></span> For He did not confound the adversary by the saying of any other, but by that belonging to His own Father, and thus overcame the strong man.</p>

<p>2. He taught by His commandment that we who have been set free should, when hungry, take that food which is given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that, when placed in the exalted position of every <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> [that can be received], we should not, either by trusting to works of righteousness, or when adorned with super-eminent [gifts of] ministration, by any means be lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, nor should we tempt <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but should feel humility in all things, and have ready to hand [this saying], <q>You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014643"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> As also the apostle taught, saying, <q>Minding not high things, but consenting to things of low estate;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014644"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;12:16</a></span> that we should neither be ensnared with riches, nor mundane <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nor present fancy, but should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we must <q>worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and serve Him alone,</q> and  give no heed to him who <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> promised things not his own, when he said, <q>All these will I give you, if, falling down, you will worship me.</q> For he himself confesses that to adore him, and to do his will, is to fall from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in what thing either pleasant or good can that man who has fallen participate? Or what else can such a person hope for or expect, except death? For death is next neighbour to him who has fallen. Hence also it follows that he will not give what he has promised. For how can he make grants to him who has fallen? Moreover, since God rules over men and him too, and without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of our Father in heaven not even a sparrow falls to the ground, <span class="stiki" id="note014645"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;10:29</a></span> it follows that his declaration, <q>All these things are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give them,</q> proceeds from him when puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For the creation is not subjected to his power, since indeed he is himself but one among <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. Nor shall he give away the rule over men to men; but both all other things, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, are arranged according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father's disposal. Besides, the Lord declares that <q>the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is a liar from the beginning, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014646"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> If then he be a liar and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be not in him, he certainly did not speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, when he said, <q>For all these things are delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will I give them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014647"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;4:6</a></span> </p>
