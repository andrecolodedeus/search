<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 23)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The devil is well practised in falsehood, by which Adam having been led astray, sinned on the sixth day of the creation, in which day also he has been renewed by Christ.</span>

<p>1. He had indeed been already accustomed to lie against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the purpose of leading men astray. For at the beginning, when God had given to man a variety of things for food, while He commanded him not to eat of one tree only, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells us that God said to Adam: <q>From every tree which is in the garden you shall eat food; but from the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, from this you shall not eat: for in the day that you shall eat of it, you shall die by death;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014648"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;2:16-17</a></span> he then, lying against the Lord, tempted man, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that the serpent said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: <q>Has God indeed said this, You shall not eat from every tree of the garden?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014649"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;3:1</a></span> And when she had exposed the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and simply related the command, as He had said, <q>From every tree of the garden we shall eat; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014650"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;3:2-3</a></span> when he had [thus] learned from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having brought his cunning into play, he finally deceived her by a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, saying, <q>You shall not die by death; for God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that in the day you shall eat of it your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014651"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;3:4</a></span> In the first place, then, in the garden of God he disputed about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if God was not there, for he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the greatness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and then, in the next place, after he had learned from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that God had said that they should die if they tasted the aforesaid tree, opening his mouth, he uttered the third <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, <q>You shall not die by death.</q> But that God was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and the serpent a liar, was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the result, death having passed upon them who had eaten. For along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death, because they ate in disobedience; and disobedience to God entails death. Wherefore, as they became forfeit to death, from that [moment] they were handed over to it.</p>

<p>2. Thus, then, in the day that they ate, in the same did they die, and became death's debtors, since it was one day of the creation. For it is said, <q>There was made in the evening, and there was made in the morning, one day.</q> Now in this same day that they ate, in that also did they die. But according to the cycle and progress of the days, after which one is termed first, another second, and another third, if anybody seeks diligently to learn upon what day out of the seven it was that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> died, he will find it by examining the dispensation of the Lord. For by summing up in Himself the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from the beginning to the end, He has also summed up its death. From this it is clear that the Lord suffered death, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to His Father, upon that day on which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> died while he disobeyed God. Now he died on the same day in which he ate. For God said, <q>In that day on which you shall eat of it, you shall die by death.</q> The Lord, therefore, recapitulating in Himself this day, underwent His sufferings upon the day preceding the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, that is, the sixth day of the creation, on which day man was created; thus granting him a second creation by means of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, which is that [creation] out of death. And there are some, again, who relegate the death of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to the thousandth year; for since <q>a day of the Lord is as a thousand years,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014652"><a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:8</a></span> he did not overstep the thousand years, but died within them, thus bearing out the sentence of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Whether, therefore, with respect to disobedience, which is death; whether  [we consider] that, on account of that, they were delivered over to death, and made debtors to it; whether with respect to [the fact that on] one and the same day on which they ate they also died (for it is one day of the creation); whether [we regard this point], that, with respect to this cycle of days, they died on the day in which they did also eat, that is, the day of the preparation, which is termed <q>the pure supper,</q> that is, the sixth day of the feast, which the Lord also exhibited when He suffered on that day; or whether [we reflect] that he (Adam) did not overstep the thousand years, but died within their limit&mdash;it follows that, in regard to all these significations, God is indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For they died who tasted of the tree; and the serpent is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a liar and a murderer, as the Lord said of him: <q>For he is a murderer from the beginning, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014653"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> </p>
