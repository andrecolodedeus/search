<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 24)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Of the constant falsehood of the devil, and of the powers and governments of the world, which we ought to obey, inasmuch as they are appointed of God, not of the devil.</span>

<p>1. As therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> lied at the beginning, so did he also in the end, when he said, <q>All these are delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014654"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;4:9</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;4:6</a></span> For it is not he who has appointed the kingdoms of this world, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <q>the heart of the king is in the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014655"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;21:1</a></span> And the Word also says by Solomon, <q>By me kings do reign, and princes administer <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. By me chiefs are raised up, and by me kings rule the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014656"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;8:15</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle also says upon this same subject: <q>Be subject to all the higher powers; for there is no power but of God: now those which are have been ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014657"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;13:1</a></span> And again, in reference to them he says, <q>For he bears not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the avenger for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to him who does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014658"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;13:4</a></span> Now, that he spoke these words, not in regard to angelical powers, nor of invisible rulers&mdash; as some venture to expound the passage&mdash; but of those of actual <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authorities, [he shows when] he says, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pay tribute also: for they are God's ministers, doing service for this very thing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014659"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;13:6</a></span> This also the Lord confirmed, when He did not do what He was tempted to by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; but He gave directions that tribute should be paid to the tax-gatherers for Himself and Peter; <span class="stiki" id="note014660"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;17:27</a></span> because <q>they are the ministers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, serving for this very thing.</q></p>

<p>2. For since man, by departing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, reached such a pitch of fury as even to look upon his brother as his enemy, and engaged without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in every kind of restless conduct, and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>; God imposed upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as they did not acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that, being subjected to the authority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and kept under restraint by their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, they might attain to some degree of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and exercise mutual forbearance through dread of the sword suspended full in their view, as the apostle says: <q>For he bears not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the avenger for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon him who does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> And for this reason too, magistrates themselves, having <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as a clothing of righteousness whenever they act in a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and legitimate manner, shall not be called in question for their conduct, nor be liable to punishment. But whatsoever they do to the subversion of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, iniquitously, and impiously, and illegally, and tyrannically, in these things shall they also perish; for the just <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> comes equally upon all, and in no case is defective. Earthly rule, therefore, has been appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the benefit of nations,  and not by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who is never at rest at all, nay, who does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to see even nations conducting themselves after a quiet manner, so that under the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> rule, men may not eat each other up like fishes; but that, by means of the establishment of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, they may keep down an excess of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> among the nations. And considered from this point of view, those who exact tribute from us are <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ministers, serving for this very purpose.</q></p>

<p>3. As, then, <q>the powers that be are ordained of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> lied when he said, <q>These are delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, I give them.</q> For by the law of the same Being as calls men into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are kings also appointed, adapted for those men who are at the time placed under their government. Some of these [rulers] are given for the correction and the benefit of their subjects, and for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; but others, for the purposes of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and punishment and rebuke: others, as [the subjects] deserve it, are for deception, disgrace, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; while the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as I have observed already, passes equally upon all. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, however, as he is the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, can only go to this length, as he did at the beginning, [namely] to deceive and lead astray the mind of man into disobeying the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and gradually  to darken the hearts of those who would endeavour to serve him, to the forgetting of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to the adoration of himself as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>4. Just as if any one, being an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, and seizing in a hostile manner another man's territory, should harass the inhabitants of it, in order that he might claim for himself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a king among those <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>; so likewise also the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, being one among those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are placed over the spirit of the air, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> has declared in his Epistle to the Ephesians, <span class="stiki" id="note014662"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> becoming <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was rendered an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the divine law: for <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is a thing foreign to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And as his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> was exposed by man, and man became the [means of] searching out his thoughts (<em>et examinatio sententi&aelig; ejus, homo factus est</em>), he has set himself to this with greater and greater determination, in opposition to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, envying his life, and wishing to involve him in his own <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> power. The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, however, the Maker of all things, conquering him by means of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and showing him to be an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, has, on the contrary, put him under the power of man. For He says, <q>Behold, I confer upon you the power of treading upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014663"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;10:19</a></span> in order that, as he obtained dominion over man by <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, so again his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> might be deprived of power by means of man turning back again to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
