<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 25)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The fraud, pride, and tyrannical kingdom of Antichrist, as described by Daniel and Paul.</span>

<p>1. And not only by the particulars already mentioned, but also by means of the events which shall occur in the time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is it shown that he, being an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> and a robber, is anxious to be adored as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that, although a mere slave, he wishes himself to be proclaimed as a king. For he (<a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>) being endued with all the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, shall come, not as a righteous king, nor as a legitimate king, [i.e., one] in subjection to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but an impious, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and lawless one; as an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, iniquitous and murderous; as a robber, concentrating in himself [all] satanic <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, and setting aside <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to persuade [men] that he himself is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, raising up himself as the only idol, having in himself the multifarious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. This he does, in order that they who do [now] worship the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by means of many abominations, may serve himself by this one idol, of whom the apostle thus speaks in the second Epistle to the Thessalonians: <q>Unless there shall come a failing away first, and the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that is worshipped; so that he sits in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showing himself as if he were God.</q> The apostle therefore clearly points out his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, and that he is lifted up above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that is worshipped&mdash; that is, above every idol &mdash; for these are indeed so called by men, but are not [really] gods; and that he will endeavour in a tyrannical manner to set himself forth as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. Moreover, he (the apostle) has also pointed out this which I have shown in many ways, that the temple in Jerusalem was made by the direction of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For the apostle himself, speaking in his own person, distinctly called it the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now I have shown in the third book, that no one is termed God by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> when speaking for themselves, except Him who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of our Lord, by whose directions the temple which is at Jerusalem was constructed for those purposes which I have already mentioned; in which [temple] the enemy shall sit, endeavouring to show himself as Christ, as the Lord also declares: <q>But when you shall see the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, which has been spoken of by Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, standing in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place (let him that reads understand), then let those who are in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> flee into the mountains; and he who is upon the house-top, let him not come down to take anything out of his house: for there shall then be great hardship, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be.</q> </p>

<p>3. Daniel too, looking forward to the end of the last kingdom, i.e., the ten last kings, among whom the kingdom of those men shall be partitioned, and upon whom the son of perdition shall come, declares that ten horns shall spring from the beast, and that another little horn shall arise in the midst of them, and that three of the former shall be rooted up before his face. He says: <q>And, behold, eyes were in this horn as the eyes of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and a mouth speaking great things, and his look was more stout than his fellows. I was looking, and this horn made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and prevailed against them, until the Ancient of days came and gave judgment to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the time came, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> obtained the kingdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014665"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse8">Daniel&nbsp;7:8</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Then, further on, in the interpretation of the vision, there was said to him: <q>The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall excel all other kingdoms, and devour the whole earth, and tread it down, and cut it in pieces. And its ten horns are ten kings which shall arise; and after them shall arise another, who shall surpass in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> all that were before  him, and shall overthrow three kings; and he shall speak words against the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wear out the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall purpose to change times and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; and [everything] shall be given into his hand until a time of times and a half time,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014666"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse23">Daniel&nbsp;7:23</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> that is, for three years and six months, during which time, when he comes, he shall reign over the earth. Of whom also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> again, speaking in the second [Epistle] to the Thessalonians, and at the same time proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his advent, thus says: <q>And then shall the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one be revealed, whom the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> shall slay with the spirit of His mouth, and destroy by the presence of His coming; whose coming [i.e., the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one's] is after the working of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, in all power, and signs, and portents of lies, and with all deceivableness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> for those who perish; because they did not receive the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they might be saved. And therefore God will send them the working of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; that they all may be judged who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but gave consent to iniquity,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014667"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> </p>

<p>4. The Lord also spoke as follows to those who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him: <q>I have come in my Father's name, and you have not received Me: when another shall come in his own name, him you will receive,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014668"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;5:43</a></span> calling <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> <q>the other,</q> because he is alienated from the Lord. This is also the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge, whom the Lord mentioned as one <q>who feared not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither regarded man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014669"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;18:2</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> to whom the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> fled in her forgetfulness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;that is, the earthly Jerusalem,&mdash; to be avenged of her adversary. Which also he shall do in the time of his kingdom: he shall remove his kingdom into that [city], and shall sit in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, leading astray those who worship him, as if he were Christ. To this purpose Daniel says again: <q>And he shall desolate the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place; and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been given for a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,  and righteousness been cast away in the earth, and he has been active (<em>fecit</em>), and gone on prosperously.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014671"><a href="../bible/dan008.htm#verse12">Daniel&nbsp;8:12</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel, when explaining his vision, states with regard to this person: <q>And towards the end of their kingdom a king of a most fierce countenance shall arise, one understanding [dark] questions, and exceedingly powerful, full of wonders; and he shall corrupt, direct, influence (<em>faciet</em>), and put strong men down, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people likewise; and his yoke shall be directed as a wreath [round their neck]; deceit shall be in his hand, and he shall be lifted up in his heart: he shall also ruin many by deceit, and lead many to perdition, bruising them in his hand like eggs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014672"><a href="../bible/dan008.htm#verse23">Daniel&nbsp;8:23</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And then he points out the time that his tyranny shall last, during which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall be put to flight, they who offer a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> unto God: <q>And in the midst of the week,</q> he says, <q>the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and the libation shall be taken away, and the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a> [shall be brought] into the temple: even unto the consummation of the time shall the desolation be complete.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014673"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;9:27</a></span> Now three years and six months constitute the half-week.</p>

<p>5. From all these passages are revealed to us, not merely the particulars of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, and [the doings] of him who concentrates in himself every satanic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but also, that there is one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who was declared by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but made manifest by Christ. For if what Daniel prophesied concerning the end has been confirmed by the Lord, when He said, <q>When you shall see the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a>, which has been spoken of by Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note014674"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;24:15</a></span> (and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel gave the interpretation of the visions to Daniel, and he is the archangel of the Creator (<em>Demiurgi</em>), who also proclaimed to Mary the visible coming and the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of Christ), then one and the same God is most manifestly pointed out, who sent the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and made promise  of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and called us into His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>
