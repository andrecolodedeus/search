<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 26)</h1>

<span class="h1a">John and Daniel have predicted the dissolution and desolation of the Roman Empire, which shall precede the end of the world and the eternal kingdom of Christ. The Gnostics are refuted, those tools of Satan, who invent another Father different from the Creator.</span>

<p>1. In a still clearer light has John, in the Apocalypse, indicated to the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> what shall happen in the last times, and concerning the ten kings who shall then arise, among whom the empire which now rules [the earth] shall be partitioned. He teaches us what the ten horns shall be which were seen by Daniel, telling us that thus it had been said to him: <q>And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but shall receive power as if kings one hour with the beast. These have one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and give their strength and power to the beast. These shall make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because He is the Lord of lords and the King of kings.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014676"><a href="../bible/rev017.htm#verse12">Revelation&nbsp;17:12</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> It is manifest, therefore, that  of these [potentates], he who is to come shall slay three, and subject the remainder to his power, and that he shall be himself the eighth among them. And they shall lay <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> waste, and burn her with fire, and shall give their kingdom to the beast, and put the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to flight. After that they shall be destroyed by the coming of our Lord. For that the kingdom must be divided, and thus come to ruin, the Lord [declares when He] says: <q>Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014677"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;12:25</a></span> It must be, therefore, that the kingdom, the city, and the house be divided into ten; and for this reason He has already foreshadowed the partition and division [which shall take place]. Daniel also says particularly, that the end of the fourth kingdom consists in the toes of the image seen by <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, upon which came the stone cut out without hands; and as he does himself say: <q>The feet were indeed the one part iron, the other part clay, until the stone was cut out without hands, and struck the image upon the iron and clay feet, and dashed them into pieces, even to the end.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014678"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse33">Daniel&nbsp;2:33-34</a></span> Then afterwards, when interpreting this, he says: <q>And as you saw the feet and the toes, partly indeed of clay, and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided, and there shall be in it a root of iron, as you saw iron mixed with baked clay. And the toes were indeed the one part iron, but the other part clay.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014679"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse41">Daniel&nbsp;2:41-42</a></span> The ten toes, therefore, are these ten kings, among whom the kingdom shall be partitioned, of whom some indeed shall be strong and active, or energetic; others, again, shall be sluggish and useless, and shall not agree; as also Daniel says: <q>Some part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be broken from it. As you saw the iron mixed with the baked clay, there shall be minglings among the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, but no cohesion one with the other, just as iron cannot be welded on to pottery ware.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014680"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse42">Daniel&nbsp;2:42-43</a></span> And since an end shall take place, he says: <q>And in the days of these kings shall the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of heaven raise up a kingdom which shall never decay, and His kingdom shall not be left to another people. It shall break in pieces and shatter all kingdoms, and shall itself be exalted for ever. As you saw that the stone was cut without hands from the mountain, and broke in pieces the baked clay, the iron, the brass, the silver, and the gold, God has pointed out to the king what shall come to pass after these things; and the dream is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and the interpretation trustworthy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014681"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse44">Daniel&nbsp;2:44-45</a></span> </p>

<p>2. If therefore the great God showed future things by Daniel, and confirmed them by His Son; and if Christ is the stone which is cut out without hands, who shall destroy temporal kingdoms, and introduce an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> one, which is the resurrection of the just; as he declares, <q>The God of heaven shall raise up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed,</q>&mdash; let those thus confuted come to their senses, who reject the Creator (<em>Demiurgum</em>), and do not agree that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were sent beforehand from the same Father from whom also the Lord came, but who assert that prophecies originated from diverse powers. For those things which have been predicted by the Creator alike through all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> has Christ fulfilled in the end, ministering to His Father's will, and completing His dispensations with regard to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Let those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore, who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Creator, either by openly expressed words, such as the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, or by a perversion of the sense [of Scripture], as those of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, be recognised as agents of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> by all those who worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; through whose agency <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> now, and not before, has been seen to speak against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Him who has prepared <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> for every kind of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>. For he did not venture to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> his Lord openly of himself; as also in the beginning he led man astray through the instrumentality of the serpent, concealing himself as it were from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Truly has <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> remarked:  That before the Lord's appearance <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> never dared to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as he did not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own sentence, because it was contained in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and allegories; but that after the Lord's appearance, when he had clearly ascertained from the words of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> has been prepared for him as he <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> from God of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and likewise for all who unrepentant continue in the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, he now blasphemes, by means of such men, the Lord who brings judgment [upon him] as being already condemned, and imputes the guilt of his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> to his Maker, not to his own <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> disposition. Just as it is with those who break the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, when punishment overtakes them: they throw the blame upon those who frame the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, but not upon themselves. In like manner do those men, filled with a satanic spirit, bring innumerable accusations against our Creator, who has both given to us the spirit of life, and established a law adapted for all; and they will not admit that the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> is just. Wherefore also they set about imagining some other Father who neither cares about nor exercises a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>  over our affairs, nay, one who even approves of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>
