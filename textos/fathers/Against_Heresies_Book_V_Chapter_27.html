<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 27)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The future judgment by Christ. Communion with and separation from the divine being. The eternal punishment of unbelievers.</span>

<p>1. If the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, then, does not exercise judgment, [it follows] that judgment does not belong to Him, or that He consents to all those actions which take place; and if He does not judge, all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> will be equal, and accounted in the same condition. The advent of Christ will therefore be without an object, yea, absurd, inasmuch as [in that case] He exercises no judicial power. For <q>He came to divide a man against his father, and the daughter against the mother, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014683"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;10:25</a></span> and when two are in one bed, to take the one, and to leave the other; and of two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> grinding at the mill, to take one and leave the other: <span class="stiki" id="note014684"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;17:34</a></span> [also] at the time of the end, to order the reapers to collect first the tares together, and bind them in bundles, and burn them with unquenchable fire, but to gather up the wheat into the barn; <span class="stiki" id="note014685"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;13:30</a></span> and to call the lambs into the kingdom prepared for them, but to send the goats into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, which has been prepared by His Father for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note014686"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;25:33</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> And why is this? Has the Word come for the ruin and for the resurrection of many? For the ruin, certainly, of those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, to whom also He has threatened a greater damnation in the judgment-day than that of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note014687"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;10:12</a></span> but for the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and those who do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Father in heaven. If then the advent of the Son comes indeed alike to all, but is for the purpose of judging, and separating the believing from the unbelieving, since, as those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> agreeably to their own choice, and as, [also] agreeably to their own choice, the disobedient do not consent to His doctrine; it is manifest that His Father has made all in a like condition, each person having a choice of his own, and a free understanding; and that He has regard to all things, and exercises a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over all, <q>making His sun to rise upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good, and sending rain upon the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014688"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> </p>

<p>2. And to as many as continue in their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does He grant communion with Him. But communion with God is life and light, and the enjoyment of all the benefits which He has in store. But on as many as, according to their own choice, depart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He inflicts that separation from Himself which they have chosen of their own accord. But separation from God is death, and separation from light is darkness; and separation from God consists in the loss of all the benefits which He has in store. Those, therefore, who cast away by <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> these forementioned things, being in fact destitute of all good, do experience every kind of punishment. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, does not punish them immediately of Himself, but that punishment falls upon them because they are destitute of all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and without end with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore the loss of these is also <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and never-ending. It is in this matter just as occurs in the case of a flood of light: those who have blinded themselves, or have been blinded by others, are for ever deprived of the enjoyment of light. It is not, [however], that the light has inflicted upon them the penalty of blindness, but it is that the blindness itself has brought calamity upon them: and therefore the Lord declared, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me is not condemned,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014689"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;3:18-21</a></span> that is, is not separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for he is united to God through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On the other hand, He says, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not is condemned already, because he has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the name of the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> that is, he separated himself from God of his own accord. <q>For this is the condemnation, that light has come into this world, and men have loved darkness rather than light. For every one who does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the light, and comes not to the light, lest his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> should be reproved. But he that does <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> comes to the light, that his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> may be made manifest, that he has wrought them in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>
