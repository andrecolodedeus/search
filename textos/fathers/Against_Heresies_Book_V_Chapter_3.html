<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 3)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The power and glory of God shine forth in the weakness of human flesh, as He will render our body a participator of the resurrection and of immortality, although He has formed it from the dust of the earth; He will also bestow upon it the enjoyment of immortality, just as He grants it this short life in common with the soul.</span>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> has, moreover, in the most lucid manner, pointed out that man has been delivered over to his own infirmity, lest, being uplifted, he might fall away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus he says in the second [Epistle] to the Corinthians: <q>And lest I should be lifted up by the sublimity of the revelations, there was given unto me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to buffet me. And upon this I besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me. But he said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you; for strength is made perfect in weakness. Gladly therefore shall I rather <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014468"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7-9</a></span> What, therefore? (as some may exclaim:) did the Lord wish, in that case, that His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> should thus undergo buffeting, and that he should endure such infirmity? Even so it was; the word says it. For strength is made perfect in weakness, rendering him a better man who by means of his infirmity becomes acquainted with the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For how could a man have learned that he is himself an infirm being, and mortal by nature, but that God is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and powerful, unless he had learned by experience what is in both? For there is nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in learning one's infirmities by endurance; yea, rather, it has even the beneficial effect of preventing him from forming an undue opinion of his own nature (<em>non aberrare in natura sua</em>). But the being lifted up against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and taking His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to one's self, rendering man ungrateful, has brought much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon him. [And thus, I say, man must learn both things by experience], that he may not be destitute of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> either towards himself or his Creator.  But the experience of both confers upon him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, and increases his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards God. Now, where there exists an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, there a greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is wrought out by the power of God for those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him.</p>

<p>2. Those men, therefore, set aside the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do not consider what the word declares, when they dwell upon the infirmity of the flesh, but do not take into consideration the power of Him who raises it up from the dead. For if He does not vivify what is mortal, and does not bring back the corruptible to incorruption, He is not a God of power. But that He is powerful in all these respects, we ought to perceive from our origin, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, taking dust from the earth, formed man. And surely it is much more difficult and incredible, from non-existent bones, and nerves, and veins, and the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> organization, to bring it about that all this should be, and to make man an animated and rational creature, than to reintegrate again that which had been created and then afterwards decomposed into earth (for the reasons already mentioned), having thus passed into those [elements] from which man, who had no previous <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, was formed. For He who in the beginning caused him to have being who as yet was not, just when He pleased, shall much more reinstate again those who had a former <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, when it is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> [that they should inherit] the life granted by Him. And that flesh shall also be found fit for and capable of receiving the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which at the beginning received the skilful touches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that one part became the eye for seeing; another, the ear for hearing; another, the hand for feeling and working; another, the sinews stretched out everywhere, and holding the limbs together; another, arteries and veins, passages for the blood and the air;  another, the various internal organs; another, the blood, which is the bond of union between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. But why go [on in this strain]? Numbers would fail to express the multiplicity of parts in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frame, which was made in no other way than by the great wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But those things which partake of the skill and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do also partake of His power.</p>

<p>3. The flesh, therefore, is not destitute [of participation] in the constructive wisdom and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if the power of Him who is the bestower of life is made perfect in weakness &mdash; that is, in the flesh&mdash; let them inform us, when they maintain the incapacity of flesh to receive the life granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether they do say these things as being living men at present, and partakers of life, or acknowledge that, having no part in life whatever, they are at the present moment dead men. And if they really are dead men, how is it that they move about, and speak, and perform those other functions which are not the actions of the dead, but of the living? But if they are now alive, and if their whole body partakes of life, how can they venture the assertion that the flesh is not qualified  to be a partaker of life, when they do confess that they have life at the present moment? It is just as if anybody were to take up a sponge full of water, or a torch on fire, and to declare that the sponge could not possibly partake of the water, or the torch of the fire. In this very manner do those men, by alleging that they are alive and bear life about in their members, contradict themselves afterwards, when they represent these members as not being capable of [receiving] life. But if the present temporal life, which is of such an inferior nature to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, can nevertheless effect so much as to quicken our mortal members, why should not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, being much more powerful than this, vivify the flesh, which has already held converse with, and been accustomed to sustain, life? For that the flesh can really partake of life, is shown from the fact of its being alive; for it lives on, as long as it is God's purpose that it should do so. It is manifest, too, that God has the power to confer life upon it, inasmuch as He grants life to us who are in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. And, therefore, since the Lord has power to infuse life into what He has fashioned, and since the flesh is capable of being quickened, what remains to prevent its participating in incorruption, which is a blissful and never-ending life granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</p>
