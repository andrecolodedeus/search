<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 31)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The preservation of our bodies is confirmed by the resurrection and ascension of Christ: the souls of the saints during the intermediate period are in a state of expectation of that time when they shall receive their perfect and consummated glory.</span>

<p>1. Since, again, some who are reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> go beyond the pre-arranged plan for the exaltation of the just, and are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the methods by which they are disciplined beforehand for incorruption, they thus entertain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions. For the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, despising the handiwork of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not admitting the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of their flesh, while they also treat the promise of God contemptuously, and pass beyond God altogether in the sentiments they form, affirm that immediately upon their death they shall pass above the heavens and the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and go to the Mother (Achamoth) or to that Father whom they have feigned. Those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore, who disallow a resurrection affecting the whole man (<em>universam reprobant resurrectionem</em>), and as far as in them lies remove it from the midst [of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> scheme], how can they be wondered at, if again they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing as to the plan of the resurrection? For they do not choose to understand, that if these things are as they say, the Lord Himself, in whom they profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, did not rise again upon the third day; but immediately upon His expiring on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, undoubtedly departed on high, leaving His body to the earth. But the case was, that for three days He dwelt in the place where the dead were, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says concerning Him: <q>And the Lord remembered His dead <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who slept formerly in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them, to rescue and save them.</q>  And the Lord Himself says, <q>As Jonas remained three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be in the heart of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014711"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;11:40</a></span> Then also the apostle says, <q>But when He ascended, what is it but that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014712"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> This, too, David says when prophesying of Him, <q>And you have delivered my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the nethermost <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>;</q>  and on His rising again the third day, He said to Mary, who was the first to see and to worship Him, <q>Touch Me not, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and unto your Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014714"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> </p>

<p>2. If, then, the Lord observed the law of the dead, that He might become the first-begotten from the dead, and tarried until the third day <q>in the lower parts of the earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014715"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> then afterwards rising in the flesh, so that He even showed the print of the nails to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,  He thus ascended to the Father;&mdash; [if all these things occurred, I say], how must these men not be put to confusion, who allege that <q>the lower parts</q> refer to this world of ours, but that their inner man, leaving the body here, ascends into the super-celestial place? For as the Lord <q>went away in the midst of the shadow of death,</q>  where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead were, yet afterwards arose in the body, and after the resurrection was taken up [into heaven], it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also, upon whose account the Lord underwent these things, shall go away into the invisible place allotted to them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there remain until the resurrection, awaiting that event; then receiving their bodies, and rising in their entirety, that is bodily, just as the Lord arose, they shall come thus into the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For no <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is above the Master, but every one that is perfect shall be as his Master.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014718"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;6:40</a></span> As our Master, therefore, did not at once depart, taking flight [to heaven], but awaited the time of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which had been also shown forth through Jonas, and rising again after three days was taken up [to heaven];  so ought we also to await the time of our resurrection prescribed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and so, rising, be taken up, as many as the Lord shall account worthy of this [privilege]. </p>
