<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 32)</h1>

<span class="h1a">In that flesh in which the saints have suffered so many afflictions, they shall receive the fruits of their labours; especially since all creation waits for this, and God promises it to Abraham and his seed.</span>

<p>1. Inasmuch, therefore, as the opinions of certain [<a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>] are derived from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> discourses, they are both <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's dispensations, and of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the resurrection of the just, and of the [earthly] kingdom which is the commencement of incorruption, by means of which kingdom those who shall be worthy are accustomed gradually to partake of the divine nature (<em>capere Deum</em> ); and it is necessary to tell them respecting those things, that it behooves the righteous first to receive the promise of the inheritance which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promised to the fathers, and to reign in it, when they rise again to behold God in this creation which is renovated, and that the judgment should take place afterwards. For it is just that in that very creation in which they toiled or were afflicted, being <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in every way by suffering, they should receive the reward of their suffering; and that in the creation in which they were slain because of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that they should be revived again; and that in the creation in which they endured servitude, in that they should reign. For God is rich in all things, and all things are His. It is fitting, therefore, that the creation itself, being restored to its primeval condition, should without restraint be under the dominion of the righteous; and the apostle has made this plain in the Epistle to the Romans, when he thus speaks: <q>For the expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the creature has been subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope; since the creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> liberty of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014721"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;8:19</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> </p>

<p>2. Thus, then, the promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which He gave to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, remains steadfast. For thus He said: <q>Lift up your eyes, and look from this place where now you are, towards the north and south, and east and west. For all the earth which you see I will give to you and to your seed, even for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014722"><a href="../bible/gen013.htm#verse13">Genesis&nbsp;13:13-14</a></span> And again He says, <q>Arise, and go through the length and breadth of the land, since I will give it unto you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014723"><a href="../bible/gen013.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;13:17</a></span> and [yet] he did not receive an inheritance in it, not even a footstep, but was always a stranger and a pilgrim therein. <span class="stiki" id="note014724"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;7:5</a>; <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse13">Hebrews&nbsp;11:13</a></span> And upon the death of Sarah his wife, when the Hittites were willing to bestow upon him a place where he might bury her, he declined it as a gift, but bought the burying-place (giving for it four hundred talents of silver) from Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite. <span class="stiki" id="note014725"><a href="../bible/gen023.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;23:11</a></span> Thus did he await patiently the promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was unwilling to appear to receive from men, what God had promised to give him, when He said again to him as follows: <q>I will give this land to your seed, from the river of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> even unto the great river Euphrates.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014726"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse13">Genesis&nbsp;15:13</a></span> If, then, God promised him the inheritance of the land, yet he did not receive it during all the time of his sojourn there, it must be, that together with his seed, that is, those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, he shall receive it at the resurrection of the just. For his seed is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which receives the adoption to God through the Lord, as John the Baptist said: <q>For God is able from the stones to raise up children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014727"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;3:8</a></span> Thus also the apostle says in the Epistle to the Galatians: <q>But you, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of the promise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014728"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse28">Galatians&nbsp;4:28</a></span> And again, in the same Epistle, he plainly declares that they who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ do receive Christ, the promise to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thus saying, <q>The promises were spoken to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and to his seed. Now He does not say, And of seeds, as if [He spoke] of many, but as of one, And to your seed, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014729"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> And again, confirming his former words, he says, <q>Even as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Know therefore, that they which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, foreseeing that God would justify the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, declared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> beforehand, That in you shall all nations be blessed. So then they which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be blessed with faithful <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014730"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;3:6</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Thus, then, they who are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be blessed with faithful <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and these are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Now God made promise of the earth to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his seed; yet neither <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> nor his seed, that is, those who are justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, do now receive any  inheritance in it; but they shall receive it at the resurrection of the just. For God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and faithful; and on this account He said, <q>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014731"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;5:5</a></span> </p>
