<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 33)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Further proofs of the same proposition, drawn from the promises made by Christ, when He declared that He would drink of the fruit of the vine with His disciples in His Father's kingdom, while at the same time He promised to reward them an hundred-fold, and to make them partake of banquets. The blessing pronounced by Jacob had pointed out this already, as Papias and the elders have interpreted it.</span>

<p>1. For this reason, when about to undergo His sufferings, that He might declare to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and those with him the glad tidings of the inheritance being thrown open, [Christ], after He had given thanks while holding the cup, and had drunk of it, and given it to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, said to them: <q>Drink all of it: this is My blood of the new covenant, which shall be shed for many for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of this vine, until that day when I will drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014732"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;26:27</a></span> Thus, then, He will Himself renew the inheritance of the earth, and will re-organize the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of [His] sons; as David says, <q>He who has renewed the face of the earth.</q>  He promised to drink of the fruit of the vine with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, thus indicating both these points: the inheritance of the earth in which the new fruit of the vine is drunk, and the resurrection of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the flesh. For the new flesh which rises again is the same which also received the new cup. And He cannot by any means be understood as drinking of the fruit of the vine when settled down with his [<a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>] above in a super-celestial place; nor, again, are they who drink it devoid of flesh, for to drink of that which flows from the vine pertains to flesh, and not spirit.</p>

<p>2. And for this reason the Lord declared, <q>When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your neighbours, nor your kinsfolk, lest they ask you in return, and so repay you. But call the lame, the blind, and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall be blessed, since they cannot recompense you, but a recompense shall be made you at the resurrection of the just.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014734"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;14:12-13</a></span> And again He says, <q>Whosoever shall have left lands, or houses, or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or brethren, or children because of Me, he shall receive in this world an hundred-fold, and in that to come he shall inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014735"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;19:29</a>; <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;18:29-30</a></span> For what are the hundred-fold [rewards] in this word, the entertainments given to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the suppers for which a return is made? These are [to take place] in the times of the kingdom, that is, upon the seventh day, which has been sanctified, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rested from all the works which He created, which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> of the righteous, which they shall not be engaged in any earthly occupation; but shall have a table at hand prepared for them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, supplying them with all sorts of dishes.</p>

<p>3. The blessing of Isaac with which he blessed his younger son Jacob has the same meaning, when he says, <q>Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a full field which the Lord has blessed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014736"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;27:27</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> But <q>the field is the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014737"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;13:38</a></span> And therefore he added, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> give to you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, plenty of grain and wine. And let the nations serve you, and kings bow down to you; and be lord over your brother, and your father's sons shall bow down to you: cursed shall be he who shall curse you, and blessed shall be he who shall bless you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014738"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;27:28-29</a></span> If any one, then, does not accept these things as referring to the appointed kingdom, he must fall into much contradiction and contrariety, as is the case with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who are involved in absolute perplexity. For not only did not the nations in this life serve this Jacob; but even after he had received the blessing, he himself going forth [from his home], served his uncle Laban the Syrian for twenty years; <span class="stiki" id="note014739"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse41">Genesis&nbsp;31:41</a></span> and not only was he not made lord of his brother, but he did himself bow down before his brother <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, upon his return from Mesopotamia to his father, and offered many gifts to him. <span class="stiki" id="note014740"><a href="../bible/gen033.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;33:3</a></span> Moreover, in what way did he inherit much grain and wine here, he who emigrated to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> because of the famine which possessed the land in which he was dwelling, and became subject to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, who was then ruling over <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>? The predicted blessing, therefore, belongs unquestionably to the times of the kingdom, when the righteous shall bear rule upon their rising from the dead;  when also the creation, having been renovated and set free, shall fructify with an abundance of all kinds of food, from the dew of heaven, and from the fertility of the earth: as the elders who saw John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord, related that they had heard  from him how the Lord used to teach in regard to these times, and say: The days will come, in which vines shall grow, each having ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>  twig ten thousand shoots, and in each one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will give five and twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall lay hold of a cluster,  another shall cry out, <q>I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me.</q> In like manner [the Lord declared] that a grain of wheat would produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear should have ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds (<em>quinque bilibres</em>) of clear, pure, fine flour; and that all other fruit-bearing trees,  and seeds and grass, would produce in similar proportions (<em>secundum congruentiam iis consequentem</em>); and that all animals feeding [only] on the productions of the earth, should [in those days] become peaceful and harmonious among each other, and be in perfect subjection to man.</p>

<p>4. And these things are borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to in writing by <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>, the hearer of John, and a companion of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, in his fourth book; for there were five books compiled (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B3;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>) by him.  And he says in addition, <q>Now these things are credible to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>.</q> And he says that, <q>when the traitor Judas did not give credit to them, and put the question, 'How then can things about to bring forth so abundantly be wrought by the Lord.' the Lord declared, 'They who shall come to these [times] shall see.' </q> When prophesying of these times, therefore, Esaias says: <q>The wolf also shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall take his rest with the kid; the calf also, and the bull, and the lion shall eat together; and a little boy shall lead them. The ox and the bear shall feed together, and their young ones shall agree together; and the lion shall eat straw as well as the ox. And the infant boy shall thrust his hand into the asp's den, into the nest also of the adder's brood; and they shall do no harm, nor have power to hurt anything in my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain.</q> And again he says, in recapitulation, <q>Wolves and lambs shall then browse together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and the serpent earth as if it were bread; and they shall neither hurt nor annoy anything in my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014746"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;40:6</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> I am quite aware that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> endeavour to refer these words to the case of savage men, both of different nations and various habits, who come to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and when they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, act in harmony with the righteous. But although this is [<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>] now with regard to some men coming from various nations to the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nevertheless in the resurrection of the just [the words shall also apply] to those animals mentioned. For God is rich in all things. And it is right that when the creation is restored, all the animals should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> and be in subjection to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and revert to the food originally given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (for they had been originally subjected in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to Adam), that is, the productions of the earth. But some other occasion, and not the present, is [to be sought] for showing that the lion shall [then] feed on straw. And this indicates the large size and rich quality of the fruits. For if that animal, the lion, feeds upon straw [at that period], of what a quality must the wheat itself be whose straw shall serve as suitable food for lions?</p>
