<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 4)</h1>

<span class="h1a">Those persons are deceived who feign another God the Father besides the Creator of the world; for he must have been feeble and useless, or else malignant and full of envy, if he be either unable or unwilling to extend external life to our bodies.</span>

<p>1. Those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who feign the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of another Father beyond the Creator, and who term him the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do deceive themselves; for they introduce him as a feeble, worthless, and negligent being, not to say malign and full of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, inasmuch as they affirm that our bodies are not quickened by him. For when they say of things which it is manifest to all do remain <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, such as the spirit and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and such other things, that they are quickened by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but that another thing [viz. the body] which is quickened in no different manner than by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> granting [life] to it, is abandoned by life&mdash;[they must either confess] that this proves their Father to be weak and powerless, or else <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and malignant. For since the Creator does even here quicken our mortal bodies, and promises them resurrection by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as I have pointed out; who [in that case] is shown to be more powerful, stronger, or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good? Whether is it the Creator who vivifies the whole man, or is it their Father, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called? He feigns to be the quickener of those things which are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> by nature, to which things life is always present by their very nature; but he does not benevolently quicken those things which required his assistance, that they might live, but leaves them carelessly to fall under the power of death. Whether is it the case, then, that their Father does not bestow life upon them when he has the power of so doing, or is it that he does not possess the power? If, on the one hand, it is because he cannot, he is, upon that supposition, not a powerful being, nor is he more perfect than the Creator; for the Creator grants, as we must perceive, what <em>He</em> is unable to afford. But if, on the other hand, [it be that he does not grant this] when he has the power of so doing, then he is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be not a good, but an <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and malignant Father.</p>

<p>2. If, again, they refer to any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on account of which their Father does not impart life to bodies, then that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must necessarily appear superior to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since it restrains Him from the exercise of His benevolence; and His benevolence will thus be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> weak, on account of that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which they bring forward. Now every one must perceive that bodies are capable of receiving life. For they live to the extent that God pleases that they should live; and that being so, the [<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>] cannot maintain that [these bodies] are utterly incapable of receiving life. If, therefore, on account of necessity and any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, those [bodies] which are capable of participating in life are not vivified, their Father shall be the slave of necessity and that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and not therefore a free agent, having His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> under His own control.</p>
