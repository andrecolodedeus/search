<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 5)</h1>

<span class="h1a">The prolonged life of the ancients, the translation of Elijah and of Enoch in their own bodies, as well as the preservation of Jonah, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the midst of extreme peril, are clear demonstrations that God can raise up our bodies to life eternal.</span>

<p>1. [In order to learn] that bodies did continue in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> for a lengthened period, as long as it was God's good pleasure that they should flourish, let [these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>] read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and they will find that our predecessors advanced beyond seven hundred, eight hundred, and nine hundred years of age; and that their bodies kept pace with the protracted length of their days, and participated in life as long as God willed that they should live. But why do I refer to these men? For <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, when he pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was translated in the same body in which he did please Him, thus pointing out by anticipation the translation of the just. Elijah, too, was caught up [when he was yet] in the substance of the [natural] form; thus exhibiting in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> the  assumption of those who are spiritual, and that nothing stood in the way of their body being translated and caught up. For by means of the very same hands through which they were moulded at the beginning, did they receive this translation and assumption. For in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> the hands of God had become accustomed to set in order, to rule, and to sustain His own workmanship, and to bring it and place it where they pleased. Where, then, was the first man placed? In paradise certainly, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> declares <q>And God planted a garden [<em>paradisum</em>] eastward in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>, and there He placed the man whom He had formed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014471"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;2:8</a></span> And then afterwards when [man] <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> disobedient, he was cast out thence into this world. Wherefore also the elders who were <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> tell us that those who were translated were transferred to that place (for paradise has been prepared for righteous men, such as have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; in which place also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle, when he was caught up, heard words which are unspeakable as regards us in our present condition <span class="stiki" id="note014472"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:4</a></span>), and that there shall they who have been translated remain until the consummation [of all things], as a prelude to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</p>

<p>2. If, however, any one <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> it impossible that men should survive for such a length of time, and that Elias was not caught up in the flesh, but that his flesh was consumed in the fiery chariot, let him consider that Jonah, when he had been cast into the deep, and swallowed down into the whale's belly, was by the command of God again thrown out safe upon the land. <span class="stiki" id="note014473"><a href="../bible/jon002.htm#verse11">Jonah&nbsp;2:11</a></span> And then, again, when Ananias, Azarias, and Misa&euml;l were cast into the furnace of fire sevenfold heated, they sustained no harm whatever, neither was the smell of fire perceived upon them. As, therefore, the hand of God was present with them, working out marvellous things in their case&mdash; [things] impossible [to be accomplished] by man's nature&mdash; what wonder was it, if also in the case of those who were translated it performed something wonderful, working in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the Father? Now this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> represents <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> the king as having said, <q>Did not we cast three men bound into the furnace? And, lo, I do see four walking in the midst of the fire, and the fourth is like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014474"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse19">Daniel&nbsp;3:19-25</a></span> Neither the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of any created thing, therefore, nor the weakness of the flesh, can prevail against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For God is not subject to <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, but <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and all things yield <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Wherefore also the Lord declares, <q>The things which are impossible with men, are possible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014475"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;18:27</a></span> As, therefore, it might seem to the men of the present day, who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's appointment, to be a thing incredible and impossible that any man could live for such a number of years, yet those who were before us did live [to such an age], and those who were translated do live as an earnest of the future length of days; and [as it might also appear impossible] that from the whale's belly and from the fiery furnace men issued forth unhurt, yet they nevertheless did so, led forth as it were by the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the purpose of declaring His power: so also now, although some, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the power and promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may oppose their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, deeming it impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who raises up the dead; to have power to confer upon them <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> duration, yet the scepticism of men of this stamp shall not render the faithfulness of God of none effect.</p>
