<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Chapter 6)</h1>

<span class="h1a">God will bestow salvation upon the whole nature of man, consisting of body and soul in close union, since the Word took it upon Him, and adorned with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, of whom our bodies are, and are termed, the temples.</span>

<p>1. Now God shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in His handiwork, fitting it so as to be conformable to, and modelled after, His own Son. For by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that is, by the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, man, and not [merely] a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the spirit are certainly a <em>part</em> of the man, but certainly not <em>the</em> man; for the perfect man consists in the commingling and the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receiving the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the admixture of that fleshly nature which was moulded after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this reason does the apostle declare, <q>We speak wisdom among them that are perfect,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014476"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> terming those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <q>perfect</q> who have received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and who through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> do speak in all languages, as he used Himself also to speak. In like manner we do also hear  many brethren in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who possess <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, and who through the Spirit speak all kinds of languages, and bring to light for the general benefit the hidden things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and declare the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom also the apostle terms <q>spiritual,</q> they being spiritual because they partake of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and not because their flesh has been stripped off and taken away, and because they have become purely spiritual. For if any one take away the substance  of flesh, that is, of the handiwork [of God], and understand that which is purely spiritual, such then would not be a spiritual man but would be the spirit of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. But when the spirit here blended with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to [God's] handiwork, the man is rendered spiritual and perfect because of the outpouring of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and this is he who was made in the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if the Spirit be wanting to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he who is such is indeed of an animal nature, and being left carnal, shall be an imperfect being, possessing indeed the image [of God] in his formation (<em>in plasmate</em>), but not receiving the similitude through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; and thus is this being imperfect. Thus also, if any one take away the image and set aside the handiwork, he cannot then understand this as being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but as either some part of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as I have already said, or as something else than a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For that flesh which has been moulded is not a perfect man in itself, but the body of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and part of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Neither is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, considered apart by itself, the man; but it is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and part of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Neither is the spirit a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for it is called the spirit, and not a man; but the commingling and union of all these constitutes the perfect man. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does the apostle, explaining himself, make it clear that the saved man is a complete man as well as a spiritual man; saying thus in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, <q>Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace sanctify you perfect (<em>perfectos</em>); and may your spirit, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and body be preserved whole without complaint to the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q>  Now what was his object in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that these three&mdash; that is, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, body, and spirit&mdash; might be preserved to the coming of the Lord, unless he was aware of the [future] reintegration and union of the three, and [that they should be heirs of] one and the same <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also he declares that those are <q>the perfect</q> who present unto the Lord the three [component parts] without offense. Those, then, are the perfect who have had the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> remaining in them, and have preserved their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies blameless, holding fast the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is [directed] towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and maintaining righteous dealings with respect to their neighbours.</p>

<p>2. Whence also he says, that this handiwork is <q>the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> thus declaring: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in you? If any man, therefore, will defile the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him will God destroy: for the temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which [temple] you are.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014479"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> Here he manifestly declares the body to be the temple in which the Spirit dwells. As also the Lord speaks in reference to Himself, <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. He spoke this, however,</q> it is said, <q>of the temple of His body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014480"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;2:19-21</a></span> And not only does he (the apostle) acknowledge our bodies to be a temple, but even the temple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, saying thus to the Corinthians, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and make them the members of an harlot?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014481"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> He speaks these things, not in reference to some other spiritual man; for a being of such a nature could have nothing to do with an harlot: but he declares <q>our body,</q> that is, the flesh which continues in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and purity, to be <q>the members of Christ;</q> but that when it becomes one with an harlot, it becomes the members of an harlot. And for this reason he said, <q>If any man defile the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him will God destroy.</q> How then is it not the utmost <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to allege, that the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which the Spirit of the Father dwells, and the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, do not partake of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but are reduced to perdition? Also, that our bodies are raised not from their own substance, but by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says to the Corinthians, <q>Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. But God has both raised up the Lord, and shall raise us up by His own power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014482"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13-14</a></span> </p>
