<h1>Against Heresies (Book V, Preface)</h1>

<p>In the four preceding books, my very dear friend, which I put forth to you, all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have been exposed, and their doctrines brought to light, and these men refuted who have devised irreligious opinions. [I have accomplished this by adducing] something from the doctrine peculiar to each of these men, which they have left in their writings, as well as by using arguments of a more general nature, and applicable to them all.  Then I have pointed out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and shown the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> proclaimed (as I have already demonstrated), but which Christ brought to perfection, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have handed down, from whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, receiving [these truths], and throughout all the world alone preserving them in their integrity (<em>bene</em>), has transmitted them to her sons. Then also&mdash; having disposed of all questions which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> propose to us, and having explained the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and clearly set forth many of those things which were said and done by the Lord in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>&mdash; I shall endeavour, in this the fifth book of the entire work which treats of the exposure and refutation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, to exhibit <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the rest of the Lord's doctrine and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> epistles: [thus] complying with your demand, as you requested of me (since indeed I have been assigned a place in the ministry of the word); and, labouring by every means in my power to furnish you with large assistance against the contradictions of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as also to reclaim the wanderers and convert them to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, to confirm at the same time the minds of the neophytes, that they may preserve steadfast the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they have received, guarded by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in its integrity, in order that they be in no way perverted by those who endeavour to teach them <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a>, and lead them away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It will be incumbent upon you, however, and all who may happen to read this writing, to peruse with great attention what I have already said, that you may obtain a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the subjects against which I am contending. For it is thus that you will both controvert them in a legitimate manner, and will be prepared to receive the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> brought forward against them, casting away their doctrines as filth by means of the celestial <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but following the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and steadfast Teacher, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who did, through His transcendent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, become what we are, that He might bring us to be even what He is Himself.</p>
