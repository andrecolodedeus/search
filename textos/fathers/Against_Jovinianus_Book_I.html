<h1>Against Jovinianus (Book I)</h1>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Jovinianus, concerning whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> little more than is to be found in the two following books, had published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a Latin treatise containing all, or part of the opinions here controverted, viz. (1) <q>That a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is no better as such than a wife in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. (2) Abstinence is no better than a thankful partaking of food. (3) A person <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the Spirit as well as with water cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. (4) All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal. (5) There is but one grade of punishment and one of reward in the future state.</q> In addition to this he held the birth of our Lord to have been by a <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> parturition,</q> and was thus at issue with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the time, according to which the infant Jesus passed through the walls of the womb as His Resurrection body afterwards did out of the tomb or through the closed doors. Pammachius, Jerome's friend, brought Jovinian's book under the notice of <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Siricius</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, and it was shortly afterwards condemned in synods at that city and at Milan (about A.D. 390). He subsequently sent Jovinian's books to Jerome, who answered them in the present treatise in the year 393. Nothing more is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Jovinian, but it has been conjectured from Jerome's remark in the treatise against Vigilantius, where Jovinian is said to have <q>amidst pheasants and pork rather belched out than breathed out his life,</q> and by a kind of transmigration to have transmitted his opinions into Vigilantius, that he had died before 409, the date of that work.</p>

<p>The first book is wholly on the first proposition of Jovinianus, that relating to marriage and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. The first three chapters are introductory. The rest may be divided into three parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>(ch. 4-13). An exposition, in Jerome's sense, of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> teaching in <a href="../bible/1co007.htm">1 Cor. vii</a>.</li>

<li>ch. 14-39). A statement of the teaching which Jerome derives from the various books of both the Old and the New Testaments.</li>

<li>A denunciation of Jovinianus (c. 40), and the praises of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and of single marriages derived from examples in the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> world.</li>
</ul>

<p>The treatise gives a remarkable specimen of Jerome's system of interpreting Scripture, and also of the methods by which <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and marriage brought into disesteem.</p>
</div>

<p>1. Very few days have elapsed since the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren of Rome sent to me the treatises of a certain Jovinian with the request that I would reply to the follies contained in them, and would crush with evangelical and apostolic vigour the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. I read but could not in the least comprehend them. I began therefore to give them closer attention, and to thoroughly sift not only words and sentences, but almost every single syllable; for I wished first to ascertain his meaning, and then to approve, or refute what he had said. But the style is so barbarous, and the language so vile and such a heap of blunders, that I could neither understand what he was talking about, nor by what arguments he was trying to prove his points. At one moment he is all bombast, at another he grovels: from time to time he lifts himself up, and then like a wounded snake finds his own effort too much for him. Not satisfied with the language of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he attempts something loftier.</p>

<blockquote><p>  <q>The mountains labour; a poor mouse is born.</q>
<br>  <q>That he's gone mad ev'n mad Orestes swears.</q>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover he involves everything in such inextricable confusion that the saying of Plautus might be applied to him:&mdash; <q>This is what none but a Sibyl will ever read.</q></p>

<p>To understand him we must be <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. We read Apollo's  raving prophetesses. We remember, too, what Virgil says of senseless noise. Heraclitus, also, surnamed the Obscure, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> find hard to understand even with their utmost toil. But what are they compared with our riddle-maker, whose books are much more difficult to comprehend than to refute? Although (we must confess) the task of refuting them is no easy one. For how can you overcome a man when you are quite in the dark as to his meaning? But, not to be tedious to my reader, the introduction to his second book, of which he has discharged himself like a sot after a night's debauch, will show the character of his eloquence, and through what bright flowers of rhetoric he takes his stately course.</p>

<p>2. <q>I respond to your invitation, not that I may go through life with a high <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, but may live free from idle rumour. I beseech the ground, the young shoots of our plantations, the plants and trees of tenderness snatched from the whirlpool of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, to grant me audience and the support of many listeners. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through hope, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, charity, is inaccessible and impregnable. In it no one is immature: all are apt to learn: none can force a way into it by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, or deceive it by craft.</q></p>

<p>3. What, I ask, is the meaning of these portentous words and of this grotesque description? Would you not think he was in a feverish dream, or that he was seized with <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and ought to be put into the strait jacket which Hippocrates prescribed? However often I read him, even till my heart sinks within me, I am still in uncertainty of his meaning.  Everything starts from, everything depends upon, something else. It is impossible to make out any connection; and, excepting the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from Scripture which he has not dared to exchange for his own lovely flowers of rhetoric, his words suit all matter equally well, because they suit no matter at all. This circumstance led me shrewdly to suspect that his object in proclaiming the excellence of marriage was only to disparage <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For when the less is put upon a level with the greater, the lower profits by comparison, but the higher suffers wrong. For ourselves, we do not follow the views of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and Manich&aelig;us, and disparage marriage; nor, deceived by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, the leader of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, do we think all intercourse impure; he condemns and rejects not only marriage but also food which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created for the use of man. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware. And that upon the foundation, Christ, which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the master-builder laid, some build gold, silver, precious stones: others, on the contrary, hay, wood, straw. We are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the words, <q>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> among all, and the bed undefiled.</q> We have read God's first command, <span class="stiki" id="note304265"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> <q>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth</q>; but while we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> marriage we prefer <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which is the offspring of marriage. Will silver cease to be silver, if gold is more precious than silver? Or is despite done to tree and grain, if we prefer the fruit to root and foliage, or the grain to stalk and ear? Virginity is to marriage what fruit is to the tree, or grain to the straw. Although the hundred-fold, the sixty-fold, and the thirty-fold spring from one earth and from one sowing, yet there is a great difference in respect of number. The thirty-fold has reference to marriage. The very way the fingers are combined&mdash; see how they seem to embrace, tenderly <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, and pledge their troth either to other&mdash; is a picture of husband and wife. The sixty-fold applies to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, because they are placed in a position of difficulty and distress. Hence the upper finger signifies their depression, and the greater the difficulty in resisting the allurements of pleasure once experienced, the greater the reward. Moreover (give good heed, my reader), to denote a hundred, the right hand is used instead of the left: a circle is made with the same fingers which on the left hand represented widowhood, and thus the crown of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is expressed. In saying this I have followed my own impatient spirit rather than the course of the argument. For I had scarcely left harbour, and had barely hoisted sail, when a swelling tide of words suddenly swept me into the depths of the discussion. I must stay my course, and take in canvas for a little while; nor will I indulge my sword, anxious as it is to strike a blow for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. The farther back the catapult is drawn, the greater the force of the missile. To linger is not to lose, if by lingering victory is better assured. I will briefly set forth our adversary's views, and will drag them out from his books like snakes from the holes where they hide, and will separate the venomous head from the writhing body. What is baneful shall be discovered, that, when we have the power, it may be crushed.</p>

<p>He says that <q><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who have been once passed through the laver of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if they are on a par in other respects, are of equal merit.</q></p>

<p>He endeavours to show that <q>they who with full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have been born again in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, cannot be overthrown by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q></p>

<p>His third point is <q>that there is no difference between abstinence from food, and its reception with thanksgiving.</q></p>

<p>The fourth and last is <q>that there is one reward in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> for all who have kept their baptismal vow.</q></p>

<p>4. This is the hissing of the old serpent; by counsel such as this the dragon drove man from Paradise. For he promised that if they would prefer fullness to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> they should be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, as though it were an impossibility for them to fall; and while he promises they shall be as Gods, he drives them from Paradise, with the result that they who, while naked and unhampered, and as <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> unspotted enjoyed the fellowship of the Lord were cast down into the vale of tears, and sewed skins together to clothe themselves withal. But, not to detain the reader any longer, I will keep to the division given above and taking his propositions one by one will rely chiefly on the evidence of Scripture to refute them, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> he may chatter and complain that he was overcome by rhetorical skill rather than by force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If I succeed in this and with the aid of a cloud of witnesses from both Testaments prove too strong for him, I will then accept his challenge, and adduce illustrations from secular literature. I will show that even among <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and distinguished statesmen, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> are wont to be preferred by all to the voluptuous, that is to say men like Pythagoras, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/01712d.htm">Aristides</a>, to Aristippus, <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and Alcibiades. I entreat <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of both sexes and all such as are continent, the married also and the twice married, to assist my efforts with their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Jovinian is the common enemy. For he who maintains all to be of equal merit, does no less injury to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in comparing it with marriage than he does to marriage, when he allows it to be lawful, but to the same extent as second and third marriages. But to digamists and trigamists also he does wrong, for he places on a level with them whoremongers and the most licentious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as soon as they have repented; but perhaps those who have been married twice or thrice ought not to complain, for the same whoremonger if penitent is made equal in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> even to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. I will therefore explain more clearly and in proper sequence the arguments he employs and the illustrations he adduces respecting marriage, and will treat them in the order in which he states them. And I beg the reader not to be disturbed if he is compelled to read Jovinian's nauseating trash. He will all the more gladly drink Christ's antidote after the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> poisonous concoction. Listen with patience, you <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; listen, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, to the voice of the most voluptuous of preachers; nay rather close your ears, as you would to the Syren's fabled songs, and pass on. For a little while endure the wrongs you suffer: think you are crucified with Christ, and are listening to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>.</p>

<p>5. First of all, he says, God declares that <span class="stiki" id="note304273"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> <q>therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</q> And lest we should say that this is a quotation from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, he asserts that it has been <span class="stiki" id="note304274"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;19:5</a></span> confirmed by the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>&mdash; <q>What God has joined together, let not man put asunder</q>: and he immediately adds,  <q>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</q> He next repeats the names of Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalalel, Jared, <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, <a href="../cathen/10048b.htm">Methuselah</a>, Lamech, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and tells us that they all had wives and in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begot sons, as though there could be any table of descent or any history of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> without wives and children. <q>There,</q> says he, is <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, who walked with God and was carried up to heaven. There is <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, the only person who, except his wife, and his sons and their wives, was saved at the deluge, although there must have been many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> not of marriageable age, and therefore presumably <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Again, after the deluge, when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> started as it were anew, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were paired together and a fresh blessing was pronounced on procreation,  <span class="stiki" id="note304276"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;9:1</a></span> <q>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</q> Moreover, free permission was given to eat flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note304277"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;9:3</a></span> <q>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.</q> He then flies off to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom the first had three wives, the second one, the third four, Leah, Rachel, Billah, and Zilpah, and he declares that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> merited the blessing which he received in begetting his son. Sarah, typifying the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when it had ceased to be with her after the manner of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, exchanged the curse of barrenness for the blessing of child-bearing. We are informed that Rebekah went like a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to inquire of the Lord, and was told, <span class="stiki" id="note304278"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;25:23</a></span> <q>Two nations and two peoples are in your womb,</q> that Jacob served for his wife, and that when Rachel, thinking it was in the power of her husband to give her children, said, <span class="stiki" id="note304279"><a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;30:1</a></span> <q>Give me children, or else I die,</q> he replied, <span class="stiki" id="note304280"><a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;30:2</a></span> <q>Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?</q> so well aware was he that the fruit of marriage comes from the Lord and not from the husband. We next learn that Joseph, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man of spotless <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and all the patriarchs, had wives, and that God blessed them all alike through the lips of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Judah also and Thamar are brought upon the scene, and he censures Onan, slain by the Lord, because he, grudging to raise up seed to his brother, marred the marriage rite. He refers to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of Miriam, who, because she chided her brother on account of his wife, was stricken by the avenging hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He praises Samson, I may even say extravagantly panegyrizes the uxorious Nazarite. Deborah also and Barak are mentioned, because, although they had not the benefit of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, they were victorious over the iron chariots of Sisera and Jabin. He brings forward Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, and extols her for arming herself with the stake. He says there was no difference between Jephthah and his virgin daughter, who was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to the Lord: nay, of the two, he prefers the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the father to that of the daughter who met death with grief and tears. He then comes to Samuel, another Nazarite of the Lord, who from infancy was brought up in the tabernacle and was clad in a linen ephod, or, as the words are rendered, <em>in linen vestments:</em> he, too, we are told, begot sons without a stain upon his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> purity. He places Boaz and his wife Ruth side by side in his repository, and traces the descent of Jesse and David from them. He then points out how David himself, for the price of two hundred foreskins and at the peril of his life, was bedded with the king's daughter. What shall I say of Solomon, whom he includes in the list of husbands, and represents as a type of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, maintaining that of him it was written,  <q>Give the king your judgments, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and your righteousness unto the king's son</q>? And  <q>To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba, and men shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him continually.</q> Then all at once he makes a jump to Elijah and Elisha, and tells us as a great secret that the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha. Why he mentioned this he does not say. It can hardly be that he thinks Elijah and Elisha, like the rest, were married men. The next step is to Hezekiah, upon whose praises he dwells, and yet (I wonder why) forgets to mention that he said,  <q>Henceforth I will beget children.</q> He relates that Josiah, a righteous man, in whose time the book of Deuteronomy was found in the temple, was instructed by Huldah, wife of Shallum. Daniel also and the three youths are classed by him with the married. Suddenly he betakes himself to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and adduces Zachariah and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>, Peter and his father-in-law, and the rest of the Apostles. His inference is thus expressed: <q>If they idly urge in defence of themselves the plea that the world in its early stage needed to be replenished, let them listen to the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note304285"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:14</a></span> 'I desire therefore that the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> marry, bear children.' And  'Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and the bed undefiled.' And <span class="stiki" id="note304287"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:39</a></span> 'A wife is bound for so long time as her husband lives; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.' And <span class="stiki" id="note304288"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:14</a></span> 'Adam was not beguiled, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> being beguiled has fallen into transgression: but she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they continue in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and sanctification with sobriety.' Surely we shall hear no more of the famous Apostolic utterance, <span class="stiki" id="note304289"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:29</a></span> 'And they who have wives as though they had them not.' It can hardly be that you will say the reason why he wished them to be married was that some <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> had already turned back after <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: as though <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> never fell and their fall was not more ruinous. All this makes it clear that in forbidding to marry, and to eat food which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created for use, you have <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> seared as with a hot iron, and are followers of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>.</q> Then comes much more which it would be unprofitable to discuss. At last he dashes into rhetoric and apostrophizes <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> thus: <q>I do you no wrong, Virgin: you have chosen a life of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> on account of the present distress: you determined on the course in order to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in body and spirit: be not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>: you and your married sisters are members of the same Church.</q></p>

<p>6. I have perhaps explained his position at too great a length, and become tedious to my reader; but I thought it best to draw up in full array against myself all his efforts, and to muster all the forces of the enemy with their squadrons and generals, lest after an early victory there should spring up a series of other engagements. I will not therefore do battle with single foes, nor will I be satisfied with skirmishes in which I meet small detachments of my opponents. The battle must be fought with the whole army of the enemy, and the disorderly rabble, fighting more like brigands than soldiers, must be repulsed by the skill and method of regular warfare. In the front rank I will set the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, and, since he is the bravest of generals, will arm him with his own weapons, that is to say, his own statements. For the Corinthians asked many questions about this matter, and the doctor of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and master of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gave full replies. What he decreed we may regard as the law of Christ speaking in him. At the same time, when we begin to refute the several arguments, I trust the reader will give me his attention even before the Apostle speaks, and will not, in his eagerness to discuss the most weighty points, neglect the premises, and rush at once to the conclusion.</p>

<p>7. Among other things the Corinthians asked in their letter whether after embracing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ they ought to be unmarried, and for the sake of continence put away their wives, and whether believing <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> were at liberty to marry. And again, supposing that one of two <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ, whether the one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> should leave the one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not? And in case it were allowable to take wives, would the Apostle direct that only <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> wives, or <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also, should be taken? Let us then consider <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> replies to these inquiries. <q>Now concerning the things whereof you wrote: It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> have her own husband. Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife has not power over her own body, but the husband: And likewise also the husband has not power over his own body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves unto <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and may be together again, that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> tempt you not because of your incontinency. But this I say by way of permission not of commandment. Yet I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself. Howbeit each man has his own gift from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one after this manner, and another after that. But I say to the unmarried and to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for them if they abide even as I. But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</q> Let us turn back to the chief point of the evidence: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> he says, <q>for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> If it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, it is bad to touch one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But surely a thing which is only allowed because there may be something worse has only a slight degree of goodness. He would never have added <q>let each man have his own wife,</q> unless he had previously used the words <q>but, because of fornications.</q> Do away with fornication, and he will not say <q>let each man have his own wife.</q> Just as though one were to lay it down: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to feed on wheaten bread, and to eat the finest wheat flour,</q> and yet to prevent a person pressed by hunger from devouring cow-dung, I may allow him to eat barley. Does it follow that the wheat will not have its peculiar purity, because such an one prefers barley to excrement? That is naturally good which does not admit of comparison with what is bad, and is not eclipsed because something else is preferred. At the same time we must notice the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. He did not say, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to have a wife: but, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: as though there were danger even in the touch: as though he who touched her, would not escape from her who <q>hunts for the precious life,</q> who causes the young man's understanding to fly away. <span class="stiki" id="note304291"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;6:27-28</a></span> <q>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</q> As then he who touches fire is instantly burned, so by the mere touch the peculiar nature of man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is perceived, and the difference of sex is understood. Heathen fables relate how <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a> and Ericthonius were begotten of the soil, in stone or earth, by raging <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Hence it was that our Joseph, because the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> wished to touch him, fled from her hands, and, as if he had been bitten by a mad dog and feared the spreading poison, threw away the cloak which she had touched. <q>But, because of fornications let each man have his own wife, and let each <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> have her own husband.</q> He did not say, because of fornication let each man marry a wife: otherwise by this excuse he would have thrown the reins to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and whenever a man's wife died, he would have to marry another to prevent fornication, but <q>have his own wife.</q> Let him he says have and use his own wife, whom he had before he became a believer, and whom it would have been good not to touch, and, when once he became a follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only as a sister, not as a wife unless fornication should make it excusable to touch her. <q>The wife has not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power over his own body, but the wife.</q> The whole question here concerns those who are married men. Is it lawful for them to do what our Lord forbade in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and to put away their wives? Whence it is that the Apostle says, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> But inasmuch as he who is once married has no power to abstain except by mutual consent, and may not reject an unoffending partner, let the husband render unto the wife her due. He bound himself voluntarily that he might be under compulsion to render it. <q>Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves unto <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</q> What, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, is the quality of that good thing which hinders <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? Which does not allow the body of Christ to be received? So long as I do the husband's part, I fail in continency. The same Apostle in another place commands us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> always. If we are to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> always, it follows that we must never be in the bondage of wedlock, for as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. The Apostle Peter had experience of the bonds of marriage. See how he fashions the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and what lesson he teaches <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note304294"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:7</a></span> <q>You husbands in like manner dwell with your wives according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, giving <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of life; to the end that your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> be not hindered.</q> Observe that, as S. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> before, because in both cases the spirit is the same, so S. Peter now, says that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are hindered by the performance of marriage duty. When he says <q>likewise,</q> he challenges the husbands to imitate their wives, because he has already given them commandment: <span class="stiki" id="note304295"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:2-3</a></span> <q>beholding your chaste conversation coupled with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</q> You see what kind of wedlock he enjoins. Husbands and wives are to dwell together according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what God wishes and desires, and give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the weak vessel, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. If we abstain from intercourse, we give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to our wives: if we do not abstain, it is clear that insult is the opposite of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. He also tells the wives to let their husbands <q>see their chaste behaviour, and the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit.</q> Words <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> worthy of an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> rock! He lays down the law for husbands and wives, condemns outward ornament, while he praises continence, which is the ornament of the inner man, as seen in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. In effect he says this: Since your outer man is corrupt, and you have ceased to possess the blessing of incorruption characteristic of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, at least imitate the incorruption of the spirit by subsequent abstinence, and what you cannot show in the body exhibit in the mind. For these are the riches, and these the ornaments of your union, which Christ seeks.</p>

<p>8. The words which follow, <q>that you may give yourselves unto <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and may be together again,</q> might lead one to suppose that the Apostle was expressing a wish and not making a concession because of the danger of a greater fall. He therefore at once adds, <q>lest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> tempt you for your incontinency.</q> It is a fine permission which is conveyed in the words <q>be together again.</q> What it was that he blushed to call by its own name, and thought only better than a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and the effect of incontinence, we take trouble to discuss as if it were obscure, although he has explained his meaning by saying, <q>this I say by way of permission, not by way of command.</q> And do we still hesitate to speak of marriage as a concession to weakness, not a thing commanded, as though second and third marriages were not allowed on the same ground, as though the doors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were not opened by repentance even to fornicators, and what is more, to the incestuous? Take the case of the man who outraged his step-mother. Does not the Apostle, after delivering him, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit might be saved, in the second Epistle take the offender back and strive to prevent a brother from being swallowed up by overmuch grief. The Apostle's wish is one thing, his pardon another. If a wish be expressed,  it confers a right; if a thing is only called pardonable, we are wrong in using it. If you wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Apostle's real <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, you must take in what follows: <q>but I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were as I am.</q> Happy is the man who is like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>! Fortunate is he who attends to the Apostle's command, not to his concession. This, says he, I wish, this I desire that you be imitators of me, as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was a Virgin born of a Virgin, uncorrupt of her who was uncorrupt. We, because we are men, cannot imitate our Lord's nativity; but we may at least imitate His life. The former was the blessed prerogative of divinity, the latter belongs to our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> condition and is part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> effort. I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were like me, that while they are like me, they may also become like Christ, to whom I am like. For <span class="stiki" id="note304296"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:6</a></span> <q>he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Christ ought himself also to walk even as He walked.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note304297"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> <q>Howbeit each man has his own gift from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one after this manner, and another after that.</q> What I wish, he says, is clear. But since in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is a diversity of gifts, I acquiesce in marriage, lest I should seem to condemn nature. At the same time consider, that the gift of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is one, that of marriage, another. For were the reward the same for the married and for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, he would never after enjoining continence have said: <span class="stiki" id="note304298"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> <q>Each man has his own gift from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one after this manner, and another after that.</q> Where there is a distinction in one particular, there is a diversity also in other points. I grant that even marriage is a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but between gift and gift there is great diversity. In fact the Apostle himself speaking of the same person who had repented of his incestuous conduct, says: <span class="stiki" id="note304299"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> <q>so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, and to whom you forgive anything, I forgive also.</q> And that we might not think a man's gift contemptible, he added, <q>for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it, in the presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> There is diversity in the gifts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence it is that by way of type Joseph has a coat of many colours. And in the forty-fifth psalm we read, <q>at your right hand does stand the queen in a vesture of gold wrought about with various colours.</q> And the Apostle Peter says, <q>as heirs together of the manifold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> where the more expressive Greek word <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F77;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span>, i.e., <em>varied</em>, is used.</p>

<p>9. Then come the words <span class="stiki" id="note304303"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:8</a></span> <q>But I say to the unmarried and to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for them if they abide even as I. But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</q> Having conceded to married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the enjoyment of wedlock and pointed out his own wishes, he passes on to the unmarried and to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, sets before them his own practice for imitation, and calls them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> if they so abide. <q>But if they have not continency, let them marry,</q> just as he said before <q>But because of fornications,</q> and <q>Lest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> tempt you, because of your incontinency.</q> And he gives a reason for saying <q>If they have not continency, let them marry,</q> viz. <q>It is better to marry than to burn.</q> The reason why it is better to marry is that it is worse to burn. Let burning <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> be absent, and he will not say it is better to marry. The word <em>better</em> always implies a comparison with something worse, not a thing absolutely good and incapable of comparison. It is as though he said, it is better to have one eye than neither, it is better to stand on one foot and to support the rest of the body with a stick, than to crawl with broken legs. What do you say, Apostle? I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you when you say <q>Though I be rude in speech, yet am I not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> As humility is the source of the sayings <q>For I am not worthy to be called an Apostle,</q> and <q>To me who am the least of the Apostles,</q> and <q>As to one born out of due time,</q> so here also we have an utterance of humility. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the meaning of language, or you would not quote <span class="stiki" id="note304304"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse12">Titus&nbsp;1:12</a></span> Epimenides, <span class="stiki" id="note304305"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:33</a></span> Menander, and <span class="stiki" id="note304306"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;17:28</a></span> Aratus. When you are discussing continence and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> you say, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> And, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for them if they abide even as I.</q> And, <q>I think that this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by reason of the present distress.</q> And, <q>That it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man so to be.</q> When you come to marriage, you do not say it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to marry, because you cannot then add <q> <em>than to burn;</em></q> but you say, <q>It is better to marry than to burn.</q> If marriage in itself be good, do not compare it with fire, but simply say <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to marry.</q> I suspect the goodness of that thing which is forced into the position of being only the lesser of two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. What I want is not a smaller <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but a thing absolutely good.</p>

<p>10. So far the first section has been explained. Let us now come to those which follow.  <q>But unto the married I give charge, yea not I, but the Lord. That the wife depart not from her husband (but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband): and that the husband leave not his wife. But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her,</q> and so on to the words <q>As God has called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.</q> This passage has no bearing on our present controversy. For he ordains, according to the mind of the Lord, that excepting the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication, a wife must not be put away, and that a wife who has been put away, may not, so long as her husband lives, be married to another, or at all events that her duty is to be reconciled to her husband. But in the case of those who are already married at the time of conversion, that is to say, supposing one of the two were a believer, he enjoins that the believer shall not put away the unbeliever. And after stating his reason, <em>viz.</em>, that the unbeliever who is unwilling to leave the believer becomes thereby a candidate for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he commands, on the other hand, that if the unbeliever reject the faithful one on account of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the believer ought to depart, lest husband or wife be preferred to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in comparison with Whom we must hold even life itself cheap. Yet at the present day many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> despising the Apostle's command, are joined to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> husbands, and prostitute the temples of Christ to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. They do not understand that they are part of His body though indeed they are His ribs. The Apostle is lenient to the union of unbelievers, who having (believing) husbands, afterwards come to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He does not extend his indulgence to those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who, although <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, have been married to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> husbands. To these he elsewhere says,  <q>Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what communion has light with darkness? And what concord has Christ with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has a temple of God with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>? For we are a temple of the living God.</q> Although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that crowds of matrons will be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> against me: although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that just as they have shamelessly despised the Lord, so they will rave at me who am but a flea and the least of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: yet I will speak out what I think. I will say what the Apostle has taught me, that they are not on the side of righteousness, but of iniquity: not of light, but of darkness: that they do not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>: that they are not temples of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but shrines and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the dead. And, if you wish to see more clearly how utterly unlawful it is for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to marry a Gentile, consider what the same Apostle says, <span class="stiki" id="note304309"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:39</a></span> <q>A wife is bound for so long time as her husband lives: but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</q> that is, to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. He who allows second and third marriages in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, forbids first marriages with a Gentile. Whence <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> also makes his servant <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> upon his thigh, that is, on Christ, Who was to spring from his seed, that he would not bring an alien-born as a wife for his son Isaac. And Ezra checked an offense of this kind against God by making his countrymen put away their wives. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Malachi thus speaks, <span class="stiki" id="note304310"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse11">Malachi&nbsp;2:11-12</a></span> <q>Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the Lord which he loves, and has married the daughter of a strange god. The Lord will cut off the man that does this,  him that teaches and him that learns, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offers an offering unto the Lord of hosts.</q> I have said this that they who compare marriage with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, may at least <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that such marriages as these are on a lower level than digamy and trigamy.</p>

<p>11. In the above discussion the Apostle has taught that the believer ought not to depart from the unbeliever, but remain in marriage as the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> found them, and that each man whether married or single should continue as he was when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ; and then he suddenly introduces the metaphors of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and uncircumcision, of bond and free, and under those metaphors treats of the married and unmarried.  <q>Was any man called being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>? Let him not become uncircumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but the keeping of the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. Were you called being a bondservant? Care not for it: but even if you can become free, use it rather. For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman; likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ's bondservant. You were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men. Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Some, I suppose, will find fault with the Apostle's way of reasoning. I would therefore ask first, What we are to infer from his suddenly passing in a discussion concerning husbands and wives to a comparison of Jew and Gentile, bond and free, and then returning, when this point is settled, to the question about <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and telling us <q>Concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> I have no commandment from the Lord</q>; what has a comparison of Jew and Gentile, bond and free, to do with wedlock and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? In the next place, how are we to understand the words <q>Hath any been called in uncircumcision, let him not be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a></q>?  Can a man who has lost his foreskin restore it again at his pleasure? Then, in what sense are we to explain <q>For he that was called in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ's bondservant.</q> Fourthly, how is it that he who commanded servants to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their masters according to the flesh, now says, <q>Become not bondservants of men.</q> Lastly, how are we to connect with slavery, or with <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, his saying <q>Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> which even contradicts his previous opinion. We heard him say <q>Become not bondservants of men.</q> How can we then possibly abide in that vocation wherein we were called, when many at the time they became <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> had masters according to the flesh, whose bondservants they are now forbidden to be? Moreover, what has the argument about our abiding in the vocation wherein we were called, to do with <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>? For in another place the same Apostle cries aloud <q>Behold I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> tell you that, if you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, Christ shall profit you nothing</q>? We must conclude, therefore, that a higher meaning should be given to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and uncircumcision, bond and free, and that these words must be taken in close connection with what has gone before. <q>Was anyone called being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>? Let him not become uncircumcised.</q> If, he says, at the time you were called and became a believer in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if I say, you were called being <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from a wife, that is, unmarried, do not marry a wife, that is, do not become uncircumcised, lest you lay upon the freedom of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> the burden of marriage. Again, if anyone was called in uncircumcision, let him not be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. You had a wife, he says, when you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: do not think the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ a reason for disagreement, because God called us in peace. <span class="stiki" id="note304314"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> <q>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For neither celibacy nor marriage avails anything without works, since even <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is specially characteristic of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, if it have not works, is said to be dead, and vestal <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and Juno's <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> might upon these terms be numbered with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <q>Let each man in the vocation wherein he was called, therein abide.</q> Whether he had, or had not, a wife when he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, let him remain in that condition in which he was when called. Accordingly he does not so strongly urge <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to be married, as forbid <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. And as he debars those who have wives from putting them away, so he cuts off from <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> the power of being married. <q>You were called being a slave, heed it not; but even if you can become free, use it rather.</q> Even if you have, he says, a wife, and are bound to her, and pay her due, and have not power over your own body; or if, to speak more clearly, you are the bondservant of your wife, be not sad upon that account, nor sigh for the loss of your <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But even if you can find some causes of discord, do not, for the sake of thoroughly enjoying the liberty of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, seek your own welfare by destroying another. Keep your wife awhile, and do not go too fast for her lagging footsteps: wait till she follows. If you are patient, your spouse will become a sister, <q>For he that was called in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise, he that was called being free, is Christ's bondservant.</q> He gives his reasons for not wishing wives to be forsaken. He therefore says, I command that <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ do not abandon the married state in which they were before embracing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for he who had a wife when he became a believer, is not so strictly devoted to the service of God as <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and unmarried <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But, in a manner, he has more freedom, and the reins of his bondage are relaxed; and, while he is the bondservant of a wife, he is, so to speak, the freedman of the Lord. Moreover, he who when called by the Lord had not a wife and was free from the bondage of wedlock, he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Christ's bondservant. What <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to be the bondservant, not of a wife but of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to serve not the flesh, but the spirit! <span class="stiki" id="note304315"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> <q>For he who is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</q> There was some <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that by saying <q>Were you called being a bondservant? Care not for it: but, even if you can become free, use it rather,</q> he might seem to have flouted continence, and to have given us up to the slavery of marriage. He therefore makes a remark which removes all cavil: <q>You were bought with a price, become not servants of men.</q> We have been redeemed with the most precious blood of Christ: the Lamb was slain for us, and having been sprinkled with <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a> and the warm drops of His blood, we have rejected poisonous pleasure. Why do we at whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> died and all his host was drowned, again turn back in our hearts to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and after the manna, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> food, sigh for the garlic and the onions and the cucumbers, and <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> meat?</p>

<p>12. Having discussed marriage and continency he at length comes to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and says <span class="stiki" id="note304316"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25-26</a></span> <q>Now concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I think therefore that this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man to be as he is.</q> Here our opponent goes utterly wild with exultation: this is his strongest battering-ram with which he shakes the wall of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. <q>See,</q> says he, the Apostle confesses that as regards <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> he has no commandment of the Lord, and he who had with authority laid down the law respecting husbands and wives, does not dare to command what the Lord has not enjoined. And rightly too. For what is enjoined is commanded, what is commanded must be done, and that which must be done implies punishment if it be not done. For it is useless to order a thing to be done and yet leave the individual free to do it or not do it. If the Lord had commanded <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> He would have seemed to condemn marriage, and to do away with the seed-plot of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> itself is a growth. If He had cut off the root, how was He to expect fruit? If the foundations were not first laid, how was He to build the edifice, and put on the roof to cover all! Excavators toil hard to remove mountains; the bowels of the earth are pierced in the search for gold. And, when the tiny particles, first by the blast of the furnace, then by the hand of the cunning workman have been fashioned into an ornament, men do not call him blessed who has separated the gold from the dross, but him who wears the beautiful gold. Do not marvel then if, placed as we are, amid <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the flesh and incentives to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, the angelic life be not exacted of us, but merely recommended. If advice be given, a man is free to proffer <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; if there be a command, he is a servant bound to compliance. <q>I have no commandment,</q> he says, <q>of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</q> If you have no commandment of the Lord, how dare you give judgement without orders? The Apostle will reply: Do you wish me to give orders where the Lord has offered a favour rather than laid down a law? The great Creator and Fashioner, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the weakness of the vessel which he made, left <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> open to those whom He addressed; and shall I, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who have become all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that I might gain all, shall I lay upon the necks of weak <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> from the very first the burden of perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>? Let them begin with short periods of release from the marriage bond, and give themselves unto <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that when they have tasted the sweets of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> they may desire the perpetual possession of that wherewith they were temporarily delighted. The Lord, when tempted by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and asked whether according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> it was permitted to put away a wife, forbade the practice altogether. After weighing His words the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> said to Him: <q>If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. But He said unto them, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, which were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, which made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</q> The reason is plain why the Apostle said, <q>concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> I have no commandment of the Lord.</q> Surely; because the Lord had previously said <q>All men cannot receive the word, but they to whom it is given,</q> and <q>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</q> The Master of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> race offers the reward, invites candidates to the course, holds in His hand the prize of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, points to the fountain of purity, and cries aloud <span class="stiki" id="note304320"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span> <q>If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</q> <q>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</q> He does not say, you must drink, you must run, willing or unwilling: but whoever is willing and able to run and to drink, he shall conquer, he shall be satisfied. And therefore Christ loves <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> more than others, because they willingly give what was not commanded them. And it indicates greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to offer what you are not bound to give, than to render what is exacted of you. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, contemplating the burden of a wife, exclaimed, <q>If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.</q> Our Lord thought well of their view. You rightly think, said He, that it is not expedient for a man who is hastening to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> to take a wife: but it is a hard matter, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not receive the saying, but they to whom it has been given. Some are eunuchs by nature, others by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of men. Those eunuchs please Me who are such not of necessity, but of free choice. Willingly do I take them into my bosom who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake, and in order to worship Me have renounced the condition of their birth. We must now explain the words, <q>Those who have made themselves eunuchs for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake.</q> If they who have made themselves eunuchs have the reward of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, it follows that they who have not made themselves such cannot be placed with those who have. He who is able, he says, to receive it, let him receive it. It is a mark of great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to be the pure temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to offer oneself a whole burnt-offering, and, according to the same apostle, to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and in spirit. These are the eunuchs, who thinking themselves dry trees because of their impotence, hear by the mouth of <span class="stiki" id="note304321"><a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;56:3</a></span> Isaiah that they have a place prepared in heaven for sons and daughters. Their type is <span class="stiki" id="note304322"><a href="../bible/jer038.htm#verse7">Jeremiah&nbsp;38:7</a></span> Ebed-melech the eunuch in Jeremiah, and the eunuch of Queen Candace in the <span class="stiki" id="note304323"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse27">Acts&nbsp;8:27</a></span> Acts of the Apostles, who on account of the strength of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> gained the name of a <em>man.</em> These are they to whom Clement, who was the successor of the Apostle Peter, and of whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> makes mention, wrote letters, directing almost the whole of his discourse to the subject of virgin purity. After them there is a long series of apostolic men, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and men illustrious no less for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> than for eloquence, with whom we may very easily become acquainted through their own writings. <span class="stiki" id="note304324"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:26</a></span> <q>I think, therefore,</q> he says, <q>that this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for the present distress.</q> What is this distress which, in contempt of the marriage tie, longs for the liberty of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? <q>Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days.</q> We have not here a condemnation of harlots and brothels, of whose damnation there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but of the swelling womb, and wailing infancy, the fruit as well as the work of marriage. <q>For it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man so to be.</q> If it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man so to be, it is bad for a man not so to be. <span class="stiki" id="note304326"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:27</a></span> <q>Are you bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.</q> Each one of us has his appointed bounds; let me have what is mine, and keep your own. If you are bound to a wife, give her not a bill of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. If I am loosed from a wife, I will not seek a wife. As I do not dissolve marriages once contracted: so you should not bind what is loosed. And at the same time the meaning of the words must be taken into account. He who has a wife is regarded as a debtor, and is said to be uncircumcised, to be the servant of his wife, and like bad servants to be <em>bound.</em> But he who has no wife, in the first place owes no man anything, then is <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, thirdly is free, lastly, is loosed.</p>

<p>13. Let us run through the remaining points, for our author is so voluminous that we cannot linger over every detail. <q>But and if you marry, you have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> It is one thing not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, another to do good. <q>And if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> marry, she has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> Not that virgin who has once for all dedicated herself to the service of God: for, should one of these marry, she will have damnation, because she has made of no account her first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But, if our adversary objects that this saying relates to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, we reply that it applies with still greater force to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, since marriage is forbidden even to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> whose previous marriage had been lawful. For <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who marry after consecration are rather incestuous than adulterous. And, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> he should by saying, <q>And if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> marry, she has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> again stimulate the unmarried to be married, he immediately checks himself, and by introducing another consideration, invalidates his previous concession. <q>Yet,</q> says he, <q>such shall have tribulation in the flesh.</q> Who are they who shall have tribulation in the flesh? They to whom he had before indulgently said <q>But and if you marry, you have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; and if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> marry, she has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh.</q> We in our inexperience thought that marriage had at least the joys of the flesh. But if they who are married have tribulation even in the flesh, which is imagined to be the sole source of their pleasure, what else is there to marry for, when in the spirit, and in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and in the flesh itself there is tribulation. <q>But I would spare you.</q> Thus, he says, I allege tribulation as a motive, as though there were not greater <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to refrain. <q>But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none.</q> I am by no means now discussing <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, of whose <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> no one entertains a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. I am coming to the married. The time is short, the Lord is at hand. Even though we lived nine hundred years, as did men of old, yet we ought to think that short which must one day have an end, and cease to be. But, as things are, and it is not so much the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> as the tribulation of marriage that is short, why do we take wives whom we shall soon be compelled to lose? <q>And those that weep, and those that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and those that buy, and those that use the world, as though they wept not, as though they rejoiced not, as though they bought not, as though they did not use the world: for the fashion of this world passes away.</q> If the world, which comprehends all things, passes away, yea if the fashion and intercourse of the world vanishes like the clouds, among the other works of the world, marriage too will vanish away. For after the resurrection there will be no wedlock. But if death be the end of marriage, why do we not voluntarily embrace the inevitable? And why do we not, encouraged by the hope of the reward, offer to God that which must be wrung from us against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. <q>He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and is  divided.</q> Let us look at the difference between the cares of the virgin, and those of the married man. The virgin longs to please the Lord, the husband to please his wife, and that he may please her he is careful for the things of the world, which will of course pass away with the world. <q>And he is divided,</q> that is to say, is distracted with manifold cares and miseries. This is not the place to describe the difficulties of marriage, and to revel in rhetorical commonplaces. I think I delivered myself fully as regards this point in my argument against Helvidius, and in the book which I addressed to <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>. At all events <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, while still a young man, gave himself full play with this subject. And my teacher, Gregory of Nazianzus, discussed <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and marriage in some Greek verses. I now briefly beg my reader to note that in the Latin manuscripts we have the reading <q>there is a difference also between the virgin and the wife.</q> The words, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, have a meaning of their own, and have by me, as well as by others, been so explained as showing the bearing of the passage. Yet they lack apostolic authority, since the Apostle's words are as we have translated them&mdash; <q>He is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,  and he is divided.</q> Having laid down this, he passes to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and the continent, and says <q>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that is unmarried and a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> thinks of the things of the Lord, that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in body and in spirit.</q> Not every unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is also a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. But every virgin is of course unmarried. It may be, that regard for elegance of expression led him to repeat the same idea by means of another word and speak of <q>a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> unmarried and a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a></q>; or at least he may have wished to give to <q>unmarried</q> the definite meaning of <q>virgin,</q> so that we might not suppose him to include harlots, united to no one by the fixed bonds of wedlock, among the <q>unmarried.</q> Of what, then, does she that is unmarried and a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> think? <q>The things of the Lord, that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and in spirit.</q> Supposing there were nothing else, and that no greater reward followed <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, this would be motive enough for her choice, to think of the things of the Lord. But he immediately points out the contents of her thought&mdash; that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and spirit. For there are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in the flesh, not in the spirit, whose body is intact, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> corrupt. But that virgin is a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose mind has not been defiled by thought, nor her flesh by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. On the other hand, she who is married thinks of the things of the world, how she may please her husband. Just as the man who has a wife is anxious for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, so the married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> thinks of the things of the world, how she may please her husband. But we are not of this world, which lies in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, the fashion of which passes away, and concerning which the Lord said to the Apostles, <span class="stiki" id="note304334"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;15:19</a></span> <q>If you were of the world, the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> its own.</q> And lest perchance someone might suppose that he was laying the heavy burden of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> on unwilling shoulders, he at once adds his reasons for persuading to it, and says: <span class="stiki" id="note304335"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse35">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:35</a></span> <q>And this I say for your profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</q> The Latin words do not convey the meaning of the Greek. What words shall we use to render <span class="greek">&#x03A0;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03B5;&#x1F54;&#x03C3;&#x03C7;&#x03B7;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x1F70;&#x03B9; &#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x039A;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&amp; 251<!--k29--&#183; &#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span> <span class="greek"><!--k29--'</span> The difficulty of translation accounts for the fact that the clause is completely wanting in Latin manuscripts. Let us, however, use the passage as we have translated it. The Apostle does not lay a snare upon us, nor does he compel us to be what we do not wish to be; but he gives his advice as to what is fair and seemly, he would have us attend upon the Lord and ever be anxious about that service, and await the Lord's will, so that like active and well-armed soldiers we may <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> orders, and may do so without distraction, which, according to <span class="stiki" id="note304336"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> Ecclesiastes, is given to the men of this world that they may be exercised thereby. But if anyone considers that his virgin, that is, his flesh, is wanton and boiling with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and cannot be bridled, and he must do one of two things, either take a wife or fall, let him do what he will, he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he marry. Let him do, he says, what he will, not what he ought. He does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he marry a wife; yet, he does not well if he marry: <span class="stiki" id="note304337"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse37">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:37-38</a></span> <q>But he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power as touching his own will, and has determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, shall do well. So then both he that gives his own virgin in marriage does well; and he that gives her not in marriage shall do better.</q> With marked propriety he had previously said <q>He who marries a wife does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q>: here he tells us <q>He that keeps his own virgin does well.</q> But it is one thing not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, another to do well. <q>Depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> he says, <q>and do good.</q> The former we forsake, the latter we follow. In this last lies perfection. But whereas he says <q>and he that gives his virgin in marriage does well,</q> it might be supposed that our remark does not hold good; he therefore immediately detracts from this seeming good and puts it in the shade by comparing it with another, and saying, <q>and he that gives her not in marriage shall do better.</q> If he had not intended to draw the inference of doing better, he would never have previously referred to doing well. But where there is something good and something better, the reward is not in both cases the same, and where the reward is not one and the same, there of course the gifts are different. The difference, then, between marriage and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is as great as that between not sinning and doing well; nay rather, to speak less harshly, as great as between good and better.</p>

<p>14. He has ended his discussion of wedlock and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and has carefully steered between the two precepts without turning to the right hand or to the left. He has followed the royal road and fulfilled the command <span class="stiki" id="note304339"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse16">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:16</a></span> not to be righteous over much. Now again he compares monogamy with digamy, and as he had subordinated marriage to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, so he makes second marriages inferior to first, and says, <span class="stiki" id="note304340"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:39-40</a></span> <q>A wife is bound for so long time as her husband lives; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgement: and I think that I also have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> He allows second marriages, but to such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as wish for them and are not able to contain; lest,  having <q>waxed wanton against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> they desire to marry, <q>having condemnation, because they have rejected their first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> and he makes the concession because many had already turned aside after <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note304342"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse40">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:40</a></span> <q>But,</q> says he, <q>they will be happier if they abide as they are,</q> and he immediately adds the weight of Apostolic authority, <q>after my judgement.</q> And that an Apostle's authority might not, like that of an ordinary man, be without weight, he added, <q>and I think that I also have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> When he incites to continence, it is not by the judgement or spirit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but by the judgement and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; when, however, he grants the indulgence of marriage, he does not mention the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, but weighs his judgement with wisdom, and adapts the severity of the strain to the weakness of the individual. In this sense we must take the whole of the following passage: <span class="stiki" id="note304343"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;7:2-3</a></span> <q>For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband. So then if, while the husband lives, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.</q> And similarly the words to Timothy, <span class="stiki" id="note304344"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:14-15</a></span> <q>I desire therefore that the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> marry, bear children, rule the household, give none occasion to the adversary for reviling: for already some are turned aside after <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> and so on. For as on account of the danger of fornication he allows <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to marry, and makes that excusable which in itself is not desirable, so to avoid this same fornication, he allows second marriages to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. For it is better to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a single husband, though he be a second or third, than to have many paramours: that is, it is more tolerable for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to prostitute herself to one man than to many. At all events this is so if the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in John's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> who said she had her sixth husband was reproved by the Lord because he was not her husband. For where there are more husbands than one the proper idea of a husband, who is a single person, is destroyed. At the beginning one rib was turned into one wife. <q>And they two,</q> he says, <q>shall be one flesh</q>: not three, or four; otherwise, how can they be any longer two, if they are several. Lamech, a man of blood and a murderer, was the first who divided one flesh between two wives. Fratricide and digamy were abolished by the same punishment&mdash; that of the deluge. The one was avenged seven times, the other seventy times seven. The guilt is as widely different as are the numbers. What the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of second marriage is, appears from this&mdash; that a person twice married  cannot be enrolled in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and so the Apostle tells Timothy,  <q>Let none be enrolled as a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.</q> The whole command concerns those <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who are supported on the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The age is therefore limited, so that those only may receive the food of the poor who can no longer work. And at the same time, consider that she who has had two husbands, even though she be a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, decrepit, and in want, is not a worthy recipient of the Church's funds. But if she be deprived of the bread of charity, how much more is she deprived of that bread which comes down from heaven, and of which if a man eat unworthily, he shall be guilty of outrage offered to the body and the blood of Christ?</p>

<p>15. The passages, however, which I have adduced in support of my position and in which it is permitted to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, if they so desire, to marry again, are interpreted by some concerning those <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who had lost their husbands and were found in that condition when they became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For, supposing a person <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and her husband dead, it would not be consistent if the Apostle were to bid her marry another, when he enjoins even those who have wives to be as though they had them not. And this is why the number of wives which a man may take is not defined, because when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> has been received, even though a third or a fourth wife has been taken, she is reckoned as the first. Otherwise, if, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and after the death of a first husband, a second is taken why should not a sixth after the death of the second, third, fourth, and fifth, and so on? For it is possible, that through some strange misfortune, or by the judgement of God cutting short repeated marriages, a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may have several husbands, while an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may be left a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> by her first husband in extreme age. The first <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was married once: the second was unmarried. Let the supporters of second marriages show us as their leader a third <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> who was twice married. But granted that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> allowed second marriages: upon the same grounds it follows that he allows even third and fourth marriages, or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> may marry as often as her husband dies. The Apostle was forced to choose many things which he did not like. He <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy, and shaved his own head, practised going barefoot, let his hair grow long, and cut it at Cenchrea. And he had certainly chastised the Galatians, and blamed Peter because for the sake of Jewish observances he separated himself from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. As then in other points connected with the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he was a Jew to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, a Gentile to <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and was made all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that he might gain all: so too he allowed second marriages to incontinent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and did not limit the number of marriages, in order that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, although they saw themselves permitted to take a second husband, in the same way as a third or a fourth was allowed, might blush to take a second, lest they should be compared to those who were three or four times married. If more than one husband be allowed, it makes no difference whether he be a second or a third, because there is no longer a question of single marriage. <span class="stiki" id="note304347"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> <q>All things are lawful, but not all things are expedient.</q> I do not condemn second, nor third, nor, pardon the expression, eighth marriages: I will go still further and say that I welcome even a penitent whoremonger. Things that are equally lawful must be weighed in an even balance.</p>

<p>16. But he takes us to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and beginning with <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> goes on to Zacharias and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>. He next confronts us with Peter and the rest of the Apostles. We are therefore bound to traverse the same course of argument and show that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> was always preferred to the condition of marriage. And as regards <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> we must maintain that before the fall they were <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in Paradise: but after they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and were cast out of Paradise, they were immediately married. Then we have the passage,  <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh,</q> in explanation of which the Apostle straightway adds, <span class="stiki" id="note304349"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians&nbsp;5:32</a></span> <q>This <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is great, but I speak in regard of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</q> Christ in the flesh is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, in the spirit he is once married. For he has one Church, concerning which the same Apostle says,  <q>Husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives, even as Christ also loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</q> If Christ loves the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holily, chastely, and without spot, let husbands also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their wives in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. And let everyone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to possess his vessel in sanctification and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, not in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of concupiscence, as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not God: <span class="stiki" id="note304351"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> <q>For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification: seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings, and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> after the image of him that created him: where there cannot be male and female, Greek and Jew, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman: but Christ is all, and in all.</q> The link of marriage is not found in the image of the Creator. When difference of sex is done away, and we are putting off the old man, and putting on the new, then we are being born again into Christ a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, who was both born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and is born again through <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. And whereas he says <q>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,</q> it was necessary first to plant the wood and to let it grow, so that there might be an after-growth for cutting down. And at the same time we must bear in mind the meaning of the phrase, <q>replenish the earth.</q> Marriage replenishes the earth, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> fills Paradise. This too we must observe, at least if we would faithfully follow the Hebrew, that while Scripture on the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days relates that, having finished the works of each, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> on the second day it omitted this altogether, leaving us to understand that two is not a good number because it destroys unity, and prefigures the marriage compact. Hence it was that all the animals which <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> took into the ark by pairs were unclean. Odd numbers denote cleanness. And yet by the double number is represented another <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: that not even in beasts and unclean birds is second marriage approved. For unclean animals went in two and two, and clean ones by sevens, so that <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> after the flood might be able to immediately offer to God <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> from the latter.</p>

<p>17. But if <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> was translated, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was preserved at the deluge, I do not think that <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> was translated because he had a wife, but because he was  the first to call upon God and to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Creator; and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> fully instructs us concerning him in the Epistle to the Hebrews. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, moreover, who was preserved as a kind of second root for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, must of course be preserved together with his wife and sons, although in this there is a Scripture <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. The ark,  according to the Apostle Peter, was a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were saved. When <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> entered into it, both he and his sons were separated from their wives; but when he landed from it, they united in pairs, and what had been separated in the ark, that is, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was joined together in the intercourse of the world. And at the same time if the ark had many compartments and little chambers, and was made with second and third stories, and was filled with different beasts, and was furnished with dwellings, great or small, according to the kind of animal, I think all this diversity in the compartments was a figure of the manifold character of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>18. He raises the objection that when God gave his second blessing, permission was granted to eat flesh, which had not in the first benediction been allowed. He should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that just as <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> according to the Saviour's word was not permitted from the beginning, but on account of the hardness of our heart was a concession of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, so too the eating of flesh was unknown until the deluge. But after the deluge, like the quails given in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to the murmuring people, the poison of flesh-meat was offered to our teeth. The Apostle writing to the Ephesians  teaches that God had purposed in the fullness of time to sum up and renew in Christ Jesus all things which are in heaven and in earth. Whence also the Saviour himself in the Revelation of John says,  <q>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending.</q> At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> we neither ate flesh, nor gave bills of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, nor suffered <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> for a sign. Thus we reached the deluge. But after the deluge, together with the giving of the law which no one could fulfil, flesh was given for food, and <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> was allowed to hard-hearted men, and the knife of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was applied, as though the hand of God had fashioned us with something superfluous. But once Christ has come in the end of time, and Omega passed into Alpha and turned the end into the beginning, we are no longer allowed <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, nor are we <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, nor do we eat flesh, for the Apostle says,  <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine.</q> For wine as well as flesh was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> after the deluge.</p>

<p>19. What shall I say of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> who had three wives, as Jovinianus says, and received <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> as a sign of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? If we follow him in the number of his wives, let us also follow him in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. We must not partly follow, partly reject him. Isaac, moreover, the husband of one wife, Rebecca, prefigures the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and reproves the wantonness of second marriage. And if Jacob had two pairs of wives and concubines, and our opponent will not admit that blear-eyed Leah, ugly and prolific, was a type of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, but that Rachel, beautiful and long barren, indicated the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let me remind him that when Jacob did this thing he was among the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and in Mesopotamia in bondage to a hard master. But when he wished to enter the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land, he raised on Mount Galeed  the heap of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, in token that the lord of Mesopotamia had failed to find anything among his baggage, and there swore that he would never return to the place of his bondage; and when, after wrestling with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> at the brook Jabbok, he began to limp, because the great muscle of his thigh was withered, he at once gained the name of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Then the wife whom he once loved, and for whom he had served, was slain by the son of sorrow near <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> which was destined to be the birthplace of our Lord, the herald of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: and the intimacies of Mesopotamia died in the land of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>20. But I wonder why he set <span class="stiki" id="note304361"><a href="../bible/gen038.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xxxviii</a></span> Judah and Tamar before us for an example, unless perchance even harlots give him pleasure; or <span class="stiki" id="note304362"><a href="../bible/gen038.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;38:9</a></span> Onan who was slain because he grudged his brother seed. Does he <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that we approve of any sexual intercourse except for the procreation of children? As regards <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, it is clear that he would have been in peril at the inn, if <span class="stiki" id="note304363"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse24">Exodus&nbsp;4:24-26</a></span> Sephora which is by interpretation <em>a bird</em>, had not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> her son, and cut off the foreskin of marriage with the knife which prefigured the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. This is that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who when he saw a great vision and heard an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or the Lord speaking in the bush, <span class="stiki" id="note304364"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;3:5</a></span> could not by any means approach to him without first loosing the latchet of his shoe, that is, putting off the bonds of marriage. And we need not be surprised at this in the case of one who was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, lawgiver, and the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that all the people when about to draw near to Mount Sinai, and to hear the voice speaking to them, were commanded to sanctify themselves in three days, and keep themselves from their wives. I am out of order in violating historical sequence, but I may point out that the same thing was said by <span class="stiki" id="note304365"><a href="../bible/1sa021.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;21:4</a></span> Ahimelech the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to David when he fled to Nob: <q>If only the young men have kept themselves from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</q> And David answered, <q>of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about these three days.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a>, like the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, might not be eaten by those who rose from the marriage bed. And in passing we ought to consider the words <q>if only the young men have kept themselves from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</q> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that, in view of the purity of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, all sexual intercourse is unclean. In the law also it is enjoined that the <span class="stiki" id="note304366"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse13">Leviticus&nbsp;21:13-14</a></span> <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> must not marry any but a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, nor must he take to wife a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. If a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> are on the same level, how is it that one is taken, the other rejected? And the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is bidden abide in the house of her father, and not to contract a second marriage. <span class="stiki" id="note304368"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse3">Leviticus&nbsp;21:3</a></span> If the sister of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dies in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is commanded to go to the funeral of his father and mother, so must he go to hers. But if she be married, she is despised as though she belonged not to him. He who has married a wife, and he who has planted a vineyard, an image of the propagation of children, is forbidden to go to the battle. For he who is the slave of his wife cannot be the Lord's soldier. And the laver in the tabernacle was cast from the mirrors of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who fasted, signifying the bodies of pure <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>: And within, <span class="stiki" id="note304371"><a href="../bible/exo037.htm">Exodus&nbsp;xxxvii</a></span> in the sanctuary, both <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and mercy-seat, and the ark of the covenant, and the table of <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a>, and the candle-stick, and the censer, were made of the purest gold. For silver might not be brought into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies.</p>

<p>21. I must not linger over <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> when my purpose is at full speed to lightly touch on each topic and to sketch the outline of a proper <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of my subject. I will pass to Joshua the son of Nun, who was previously called <em>Ause</em>, or better, as in the Hebrew, <em>Osee</em>, that is, <em>Saviour</em>. For he, according to the epistle of Jude, saved the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and led them forth out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and brought them into the land of promise. As soon as this Joshua <span class="stiki" id="note304373"><a href="../bible/jos003.htm">Joshua&nbsp;iii</a></span> reached the Jordan, the waters of marriage, which had ever flowed in the land, dried up and stood in one heap; and the whole people, barefooted and on dry ground, crossed over, and came to Gilgal, and there was a second time <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. If we take this literally, it cannot possibly stand. For if we had two foreskins, or if another could grow after the first was cut off, there would be room for speaking of a second <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. But the meaning is that Joshua <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the people who had crossed the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> knife, and he <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> them with a stone knife, that what in the case of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> son was prefigured in a few might under Joshua be fulfilled in all. Moreover, the very foreskins were heaped together and buried, and covered with earth, and the fact that the reproach of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was taken away, and the name of the place, <em>Gilgal</em>, which is by interpretation  <em>revelation</em>, show that while the people wandered in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> uncircumcised their eyes were blinded. Let us see what follows. After this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the consecration of twelve stones at the place of revelation, the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> was immediately celebrated, a lamb was slain for them, and they ate the food of the Holy Land. Joshua went forth, and was met by the Prince of the host, sword in hand, that is either to show that he was ready to fight for the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> people, or to sever the tie of marriage. And in the same way that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was commanded, so was he:  <q>loose your shoe, for the place whereon you stand is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ground.</q> For if the armed <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> was represented by the trumpets of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, we may see in <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> a type of the overthrow of the world by the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And to pass over endless details (for it is not my purpose now to unfold all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>), <span class="stiki" id="note304376"><a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse3">Joshua&nbsp;10:3</a></span> five kings who previously reigned in the land of promise, and opposed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> army, were overcome in battle with Joshua. I think it is clearly to be understood that before the Lord led his people from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> them, sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch had the dominion, and that to these, as to five princes, everything was subject. And when they <span class="stiki" id="note304377"><a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse16">Joshua&nbsp;10:16</a></span> took refuge in the cave of the body and in a place of darkness, Jesus entered the body itself and slew them, that the source of their power might be the instrument of their death.</p>

<p>22. But it is now time for us to raise the standard of Joshua's <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. It is written that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had a wife. Now <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is interpreted both by our Lord and by the Apostle to mean the law: <span class="stiki" id="note304378"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;16:29</a></span> <q>They have <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> And <span class="stiki" id="note304379"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;5:14</a></span> <q>Death reigned from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> until <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, even over them that had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> after the likeness of Adam's transgression.</q> And no one doubts that in both passages <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> signifies the law. We read that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that is the law, had a wife: show me then in the same way that Joshua the son of Nun had either wife or children, and if you can do so, I will confess that I am beaten. He certainly received the fairest spot in the division of the land of Judah, and died, not in the <em>twenties</em>, which are ever unlucky in Scripture&mdash; by them are reckoned the years of <span class="stiki" id="note304380"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse41">Genesis&nbsp;31:41</a></span> Jacob's service, <span class="stiki" id="note304381"><a href="../bible/gen037.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;37:28</a></span> the price of Joseph, and <span class="stiki" id="note304382"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;32:14</a></span> sundry presents which <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> who was fond of them received&mdash; but in the  <em>tens</em>, whose praises we have often sung; and he was buried in  <em>Thamnath Sare</em>, that is, <em>most perfect sovereignty</em>, or among those <em>of a new covering</em>, to signify the crowds of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, covered by the Saviour's aid on Mount Ephraim, that is, the <em>fruitful mountain;</em> on the north of the Mountain of Gaash, which is, being interpreted, <em>disturbance:</em> for <q>Mount Sion is on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,</q> is ever exposed to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and in every trial says  <q>But my feet had well near slipped.</q> The book which bears the name of Joshua ends with his burial. Again in the book of Judges we read of him as though he had risen and come to life again, and by way of summary his works are extolled. We read too <span class="stiki" id="note304387"><a href="../bible/jos024.htm#verse28">Joshua&nbsp;24:28</a></span> <q>So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance, that they might possess the land.</q> And <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> served the Lord all the days of Joshua,</q> and so on. There immediately follows: <q>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</q> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, moreover, only saw the land of promise; he could not enter: and <span class="stiki" id="note304388"><a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;34:6</a></span> <q>he died in the land of Moab, and the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of his sepulchre unto this day.</q> Let us compare the burial of the two: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> died in the land of Moab, Joshua in the land of Jud&aelig;a. The former was buried in a valley over against the house of Phogor, which is, being interpreted, <em>reproach</em> (for the Hebrew Phogor corresponds to Priapus ); the latter in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash. And in the simple expressions of the sacred Scriptures there is always a more subtle meaning. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gloried in children and child-bearing; and the barren <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who had not offspring in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, was accursed; but blessed was he whose seed was in Sion, and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Jerusalem; and part of the highest blessing was,  <q>Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of your house, your children like olive plants, round about your table.</q> Therefore his grave is described as placed in a valley over against the house of an idol which was in a special sense <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. But we who fight under Joshua our leader, even to the present day <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was buried. For we despise Phogor, and all his shame, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they who are in the flesh cannot please God. And the Lord before the flood had said <q>My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh.</q> Wherefore, when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> died, the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> mourned for him; but Joshua like one on his way to victory was unmourned. For marriage ends at death; <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> thereafter begins to wear the crown.</p>

<p>23. Next he brings forward Samson, and does not consider that the Lord's Nazarite was once shaven bald by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And although Samson continues to be a type of the Saviour because he loved a harlot from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which harlot corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and because he slew more enemies in his death than he did in his life, yet he does not set an example of conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. And he surely reminds us  of Jacob's <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>&mdash; he was shaken by his runaway steed, bitten by an adder and fell backwards. But why he enumerated Deborah, and Barak, and the wife of Heber the Kenite, I am at a loss to understand. For it is one thing to draw up a list of military commanders in historical sequence, another to indicate certain figures of marriage which cannot be found in them. And whereas he prefers the fidelity of the father Jephthah to the tears of the virgin daughter, that makes for us. For we are not commending <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of the world so much as those who are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, and most Hebrews blame the father for the rash vow he made, <span class="stiki" id="note304393"><a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#verse30">Judges&nbsp;11:30-31</a></span> <q>If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into mine hand, then it shall be, that whatsoever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be for the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</q> Supposing (they say) a dog or an ass had met him, what would he have done? Their meaning is that God so ordered events that he who had improvidently made a vow, should learn his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by the death of his daughter. And if Samuel who was brought up in the tabernacle married a wife, how does that prejudice <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? As if at the present day also there were not many married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and as though the Apostle did not <span class="stiki" id="note304394"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2</a></span> describe a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as the husband of one wife, having children with all purity. At the same time we must not forget that Samuel was a Levite, not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Hence it was that his mother made for him a linen ephod, that is, a linen garment to go over the shoulders, which was the proper dress of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and of the inferior order. And so he is not named in the Psalms among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but among those who call upon the name of the Lord:  <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> among his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and Samuel among those who call upon his name.</q> For Levi begot Kohath, Kohath begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Korah, Korah begot Assir, Assir begot Elkanah, Elkanah begot Zuph, Zuph begot Tahath, Tahath begot Eliel, Eliel begot Jeroham, Jeroham begot Elkanah, Elkanah begot Samuel. And no one doubts that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sprang from the stock of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, Eleazar, and Phinees. And seeing that they had wives, they would be rightly brought against us, if, led away by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, we were to maintain that marriage deserved censure, and our <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> were not after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, without father, without mother,  <span class="greek">&#x0391;&#x1FBF;&#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, that is, unmarried. And much fruit <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> did Samuel reap from his children! He himself pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <span class="stiki" id="note304398"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:22</a></span> begot such children as displeased the Lord. But if in support of second marriage, he urges the instance of Boaz and Ruth, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse6">Matthew 1:6</a></span> to typify the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even Rahab the harlot is reckoned among our Lord's ancestors.</p>

<p>24. He boasts that David bought his wife for two hundred foreskins. But he should remember that David had numerous other wives, and afterwards received Michal, Saul's daughter, whom her father had delivered to another, and when he was old got heat from the embrace of the Shunammite maiden. And I do not say this because I am bold enough to disparage <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, but because it is one thing to live under the law, another to live under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. David slew Uriah the Hittite and committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with Bathsheba. And because he was a man of blood&mdash; the reference is not, as some think, to his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, but to the  <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>&mdash; he was not permitted to build a temple of the Lord. But as for us, <span class="stiki" id="note304400"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;18:6</a></span> if we <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> one of the least to stumble, and if we say to a brother <span class="stiki" id="note304401"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> <em>Raca</em>, or <span class="stiki" id="note304402"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;5:27</a></span> use our eyes improperly, it were good that a millstone were hanged about our neck, we shall be in danger of Gehenna, and a mere glance will be reckoned to us for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. He passes on to Solomon, through whom wisdom itself sang its own praises. Seeing that not content with dwelling upon his praises, he calls him uxorious, I am surprised that he did not add the words of the Canticles: <span class="stiki" id="note304403"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse8">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:8</a></span> <q>There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and maidens without number,</q> and those of the First Book of Kings; <span class="stiki" id="note304404"><a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;11:3</a></span> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines, and others without number. These are they who turned away his heart from the Lord: and yet before he had many wives, and fell into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, at the beginning of his reign and in his early years he built a temple to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. For every one is judged not for what he will be, but for what he is. But if Jovinianus approves the example of Solomon, he will no longer be in favour of second and third marriages only, but unless he has seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, he cannot be the king's antitype or attain to his merit. I earnestly again and again remind you, my reader, that I am compelled to speak as I do, and that I do not disparage our predecessors under the law, but am well aware that they served their generation according to their circumstances, and fulfilled the Lord's command to increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth. And what is more they were figures of those that were to come. But we to whom it is said, <span class="stiki" id="note304405"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:29</a></span> <q>The time is shortened, that henceforth those that have wives may be as though they had none,</q> have a different command, and for us <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the Virgin Saviour.</p>

<p>25. What folly it was to include Elijah and Elisha in a list of married men, is plain without a word from me. For, since John Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah, and John was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, it is clear that he came not only in Elijah's spirit, but also in his bodily <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Then the passage relating to Hezekiah might be adduced (though Jovinianus with his wonted stupidity did not notice it), in which after his recovery and the addition of fifteen years to his life he said, <q>Now will I beget children.</q> It must be remembered, however, that in the Hebrew texts the passage is not so, but runs thus: <span class="stiki" id="note304406"><a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;38:19</a></span> <q>The father to the children shall make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> your faithfulness.</q> Nor need we wonder that Huldah, the prophetess, and wife of Shallum, was <span class="stiki" id="note304407"><a href="../bible/2ki022.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;22:14</a></span> consulted by Josiah, King of Judah, when the captivity was approaching and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the Lord was falling upon Jerusalem: since it is the rule of Scripture when <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men fail, to praise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to the reproach of men. And it is superfluous to speak of Daniel, for the Hebrews to the present day affirm that the three youths were eunuchs, in accordance with the declaration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which Isaiah utters to Hezekiah: <span class="stiki" id="note304408"><a href="../bible/2ki020.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;20:18</a></span> <q>And of your sons that shall issue from you, which you shall beget, shall they take away: and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the King of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</q> And again in Daniel we read: <span class="stiki" id="note304409"><a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse3">Daniel&nbsp;1:3-4</a></span> <q>And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, even of the seed royal and of the nobles: youth in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and understanding science.</q> The conclusion is that if Daniel and the three youths were chosen from the seed royal, and if Scripture foretold that that there should be eunuchs of the seed royal, these men were those who were made eunuchs. If he meets us with the argument that in Ezekiel  it is said that <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Daniel and Job in a sinful land could not free their sons and daughters, we reply that the words are used hypothetically. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and Job were not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at that time: we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they lived many ages before. And the meaning is this: if there were such and such men in a sinful land, they shall not be able to save their own sons and daughters: because the righteousness of the father shall not save the son, nor shall the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one be imputed to another. <span class="stiki" id="note304411"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:4</a></span> <q>For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it shall die.</q> This, too, must be said, that Daniel, as the history of his book shows, was taken captive with King Jehoiakim at the same time that Ezekiel was also led into captivity. How then could he have sons who was still a youth? And only three years had elapsed when he was brought in to wait upon the king. Let no one suppose that Ezekiel at this time remembers Daniel as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not as a youth; for <q>It came to pass,</q> he says,  <q>in the sixth year,</q> that is of King Jehoiakim, <q>in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month:</q> and, <q>as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me.</q> Yet on that same day it was said to him, <span class="stiki" id="note304413"><a href="../bible/eze014.htm#verse14">Ezekiel&nbsp;14:14</a></span> <q>Though these three men, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Daniel, and Job were in it.</q> Daniel was therefore a youth, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the people, either on account of his interpretation of the king's dreams,  or on account of the release of Susannah, and the slaying of the elders. And it is clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that at the time these things were spoken of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Daniel, and Job, Daniel was still a youth and could not have had sons and daughters, whom he might save by his righteousness. So far concerning the Law.</p>

<p>26. Coming to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> he sets before us Zacharias and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>, Peter and his mother-in-law, and, with a shamelessness to which we have now grown accustomed, fails to understand that they, too, ought to have been reckoned among those who served the Law. For the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> had no being before the crucifixion of Christ&mdash; it was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and by His blood. In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage. For when Peter, representing the Apostles, says to the Lord: <span class="stiki" id="note304415"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;19:27</a></span> <q>Lo we have left all and followed you,</q> the Lord answered him, <span class="stiki" id="note304416"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;18:29-30</a></span> <q>Verily I say unto you, there is no man that has left house or wife, or brethren, or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or children for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> But if, in order to show that all the Apostles had wives, he meets us with the words  <q>Have we no right to lead about <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> or wives</q> (for <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;</span> in Greek has both meanings) <q>even as the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and Cephas, and the brethren of the Lord?</q> let him add what is found in the Greek copies, <q>Have we no right to lead about <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that are sisters, or wives?</q> This makes it clear that the writer referred to other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who, in accordance with Jewish custom, ministered to their teachers of their substance, as we read was the practice with even our Lord himself. Where there is a previous reference to eating and drinking, and the outlay of money, and mention is afterwards made of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that are sisters, it is quite clear, as we have said, that we must understand, not wives, but those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who ministered of their substance. And we read the same account in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> of the Shunammite who was wont to welcome Elisha, and to put for him a table, and bread, and a candlestick, and the rest. At all events if we take <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span> to mean <em>wives</em>, not <em><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a></em>, the addition of the word <em>sisters</em> destroys the effect of the word <em>wives</em>, and shows that they were related in spirit, not by wedlock. Nevertheless, with the exception of the Apostle Peter, it is not openly stated that the Apostles had wives; and since the statement is made of one while nothing is said about the rest, we must understand that those of whom Scripture gives no such description had no wives. Yet Jovinianus, who has arrayed against us Zacharias and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>, Peter and his wife's mother, should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that John was the son of Zacharias and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a>, that is, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> was the offspring of marriage, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the law, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of matrimony; so that by a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> the virgin Lord might be both announced and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But we might say concerning Peter, that he had a mother-in-law when he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and no longer had a wife, although in the  <q>Sentences</q> we read of both his wife and daughter. But for the present our argument must be based wholly on Scripture. He has made his appeal to the Apostles, because he thinks that they, who hold the chief authority in our moral system and are the typical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers, were not <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. If, then, we allow that they were not <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> (and, with the exception of Peter, the point cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>), yet I must tell him that it is to the Apostles that the words of Isaiah relate: <span class="stiki" id="note304419"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;1:9</a></span> <q>Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we should have been as <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, we should have been like <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>.</q> So, then, they who were by birth <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> could not under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> recover the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which they had lost in <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>. And yet John, one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who is related to have been the youngest of the Apostles, and who was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> when he embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, remained a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and on that account was more beloved by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, and lay upon the breast of Jesus. And what Peter, who had had a wife, did not dare ask, <span class="stiki" id="note304420"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;13:25</a></span> he requested John to ask. And after the resurrection, when Mary Magdalene told them that the Lord had risen, <span class="stiki" id="note304421"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;20:4</a></span> they both ran to the sepulchre, but John outran Peter. And when they were fishing in the ship on the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus stood upon the shore, and the Apostles <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not who it was they saw;  the virgin alone recognized a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and said to Peter, <q>It is the Lord.</q> Again, after hearing the prediction that he must be bound by another, and led whither he would not, and must suffer on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, Peter said, <q>Lord what shall this man do?</q> being unwilling to desert John, with whom he had always been united. Our Lord said to him, <q>What is that to you if I wish him so to be?</q> Whence the saying went abroad among the brethren that that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> should not die. Here we have a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> does not die, and that the defilement of marriage is not washed away by the blood of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> abides with Christ, and its sleep is not death but a passing to another state. If, however, Jovinianus should obstinately contend that John was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, (whereas we have maintained that his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the special <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our Lord bore to him), let him explain, if he was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, why it was that he was loved more than the other Apostles. But you say, <span class="stiki" id="note304423"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was founded upon Peter: although elsewhere the same is attributed to all the Apostles, and they all receive the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and the strength of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> depends upon them all alike, yet one among the twelve is chosen so that when a head has been appointed, there may be no occasion for <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. But why was not John chosen, who was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>? Deference was paid to age, because Peter was the elder: one who was a youth, I may say almost a boy, could not be set over men of advanced age; and a good master who was bound to remove every occasion of strife among his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and who had said to them, <span class="stiki" id="note304425"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;14:27</a></span> <q>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,</q> and, <q>He that is the greater among you, let him be the least of all,</q> would not be thought to afford <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> against the youth whom he had loved. We maybe sure that John was then a boy because <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> most clearly proves that he lived to the reign of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, that is, he fell asleep in the sixty-eighth year after <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">our Lord's passion</a>, as I have briefly noted in my treatise on <em>Illustrious Men</em>.  Peter is an Apostle, and John is an Apostle&mdash; the one a married man, the other a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; but Peter is an Apostle only, John is both an Apostle and an Evangelist, and a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. An Apostle, because he wrote to the Churches as a master; an Evangelist, because he composed a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, a thing which no other of the Apostles, excepting Matthew, did; a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, for he saw in the island of <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a>, to which he had been banished by the Emperor <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the Lord, an Apocalypse containing the boundless <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the future. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, more over, relates that he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that having been plunged into a jar of boiling oil he came out fresher and more active than when he went in. But his very <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is widely different from the rest. Matthew as though he were writing of a man begins thus: <q>The book of the Generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>;</q> Luke begins with the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Zacharias; Mark with a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Malachi and Isaiah. The first has the face of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, on account of the genealogical table; the second, the face of a calf, on account of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; the third, the face of a lion, on account of the voice of one crying in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note304428"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;40:3</a></span> <q>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.</q> But John like an eagle soars aloft, and reaches the Father Himself, and says, <span class="stiki" id="note304429"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and so on. The virgin writer expounded <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which the married could not, and to briefly sum up all and show how great was the privilege of John, or rather of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in John, the Virgin Mother <span class="stiki" id="note304430"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;19:26-27</a></span> was entrusted by the Virgin Lord to the Virgin <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</p>

<p>27. But we toil to no purpose. For our opponent urges against us the Apostolic sentence and says,  <q>Adam was first formed, then Eve; and <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not beguiled, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> being beguiled has fallen into transgression: but she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they continue in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and sanctification with sobriety.</q> Let us consider what led the Apostle to make this declaration: <q>I desire therefore that the men <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in every place, lifting up <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hands, without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and disputing.</q> So in due course he lays down rules of life for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and says <q>In like manner that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; but (which becomes <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> professing godliness) through good works. Let a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> learn in quietness with all subjection. But I permit not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach, nor to have dominion over a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but to be in quietness.</q> And that the lot of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> might not seem a hard one, reducing her to the condition of a slave to her husband, the Apostle recalls the ancient law and goes back to the first example: that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was first made, then the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> out of his rib; and that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> could not seduce Adam, but did seduce Eve; and that after displeasing God she was immediately subjected to the man, and began to turn to her husband; and he points out that she who was once tied with the bonds of marriage and was reduced to the condition of Eve, might blot out the  old transgression by the  procreation of children: provided, however, that she bring up the children themselves in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and in sanctification and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; for we must not adopt the faulty reading of the Latin texts, <em>sobrietas</em>, but <em>castitas</em>, that is, <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;</span> . You see how you are mastered by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of this passage also, and cannot but be driven to admit that what you thought was on the side of marriage tells in favour of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is saved in child-bearing, and the more the children the greater the safety of the mothers, why did he add <q>if they continue in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and sanctification with <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a></q>? The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> will then be saved, if she bear not children who will remain <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>: if what she has herself lost, she attains in her children, and makes up for the loss and decay, of the root by the excellence of the flower and fruit.</p>

<p>28. Above, in passing, when our opponent adduced Solomon, who, although he had many wives, nevertheless built the temple, I briefly replied that it was my intention to run over the remaining points. Now that he may not cry out that both Solomon and others under the law, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, have been dishonoured by us, let us show what this very man with his many wives and concubines thought of marriage. For no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> better than he who suffered through them, what a wife or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is. Well then, he says in the Proverbs: <q>The foolish and bold <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> comes to want bread.</q> What bread? Surely that bread which comes down from heaven: and he immediately adds  <q>The earth-born perish in her house, rush into the depths of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> Who are the earth-born that perish in her house? They of course who follow the first Adam, who is of the earth, and not the second, who is from heaven. And again in another place: <q>Like a worm in wood, so a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> destroys her husband.</q> But if you assert that this was spoken of bad wives, I shall briefly answer: What necessity rests upon me to run the risk of the wife I marry proving good or bad? <span class="stiki" id="note304438"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;21:19</a></span> <q>It is better,</q> he says, <q>to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and passionate <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in a wide house.</q> How seldom we find a wife without these faults, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> who is married. Hence that sublime orator, Varius Geminus  says well <q>The man who does not quarrel is a bachelor.</q> <q>It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a contentious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in a house in common.</q> If a house common to husband and wife makes a wife <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and breeds contempt for the husband: how much more if the wife be the richer of the two, and the husband but a lodger in her house! She begins to be not a wife, but mistress of the house; and if she offend her husband, they must part. <span class="stiki" id="note304441"><a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;27:15</a></span> <q>A continual dropping on a wintry day</q> turns a man out of doors, and so will a contentious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> drive a man from his own house. She floods his house with her constant nagging and daily chatter, and ousts him from his own home, that is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence the same Solomon previously commands: <q>My son flows forth beyond.</q> And the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says <q>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things spoken, lest haply we flow forth beyond.</q> But who can hide from himself what is thus enigmatically expressed? <span class="stiki" id="note304443"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;30:15-16</a></span> <q>The horseleech had three daughters, dearly loved, but they satisfied her not, and a fourth is not satisfied when you say Enough; the grave, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire that says not, Enough.</q> The horse-leech is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the daughters of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> are dearly loved, and they cannot be satisfied with the blood of the slain: <em>the grave, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the earth dry and scorched with heat</em>. It is not the harlot, or the adulteress who is spoken of; but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in general is accused of ever being insatiable; put it out, it bursts into flame; give it plenty, it is again in need; it enervates a man's <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and engrosses all thought except for the passion which it feeds. What we read in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which follows is to the same effect: <q>For three things the earth does tremble, and for four which it cannot bear: for a servant when he is king: and a fool when he is filled with meat: for an odious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> when she is married to a good husband: and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</q> See how a wife is classed with the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But if you reply that it is an <em>odious</em> wife, I will give you the same answer as before&mdash; the mere possibility of such danger is in itself no light matter. For he who marries a wife is uncertain whether he is marrying an odious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or one worthy of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. If she be odious, she is intolerable. If worthy of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is compared to the grave, to the parched earth, and to fire.</p>

<p>29. Let us come to Ecclesiastes and adduce a few corroborative passages from him also. <q>To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.</q> We brought forth young under the law with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, let us die under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with Christ. We planted in marriage, let us by <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> pluck up that which was planted. <q>A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing: a time to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and a time to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>: a time for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and a time for peace.</q> And at the same time he warns us not to prefer the law to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; nor to think that virgin purity is to be placed on a level with marriage: <span class="stiki" id="note304445"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse10">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:10</a></span> <q>Better,</q> he says, <q>is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof.</q> And he immediately adds: <q>Say not thou, what is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the former days were better than these? For thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</q> And he gives the reason why the latter days are better than the former: <q>For wisdom with an inheritance is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> Under the law carnal wisdom was followed by the sword of death; under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance awaits spiritual wisdom. <q>Behold, this have I found, <span class="stiki" id="note304447"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse28">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:28-29</a></span> says the Preacher, one man among a thousand have I found; but a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> among all those have I not found. Behold this only have I found, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</q> He says that he had found man upright. Consider the force of the words. The word <em>man</em> comprehends both male and female. <q>But a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> he says, <q>among all these have I not found.</q> Let us read the beginning of Genesis, and we shall find Adam, that is <em>man</em>, called both male and female. Having then been created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> good and upright, by our own fault we have fallen to a worse condition; and that which in Paradise had been upright, when we left Paradise was corrupt. If you object that before they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> there was a distinction in sex between male and female, and that they could without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have come together, it is uncertain what might have happened. For we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the judgements of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and anticipate his sentence as we choose. What really happened is plain enough&mdash;that they who in Paradise remained in perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, when they were expelled from Paradise were joined together. Or if Paradise admits of marriage, and there is no difference between marriage and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, what prevented their previous intercourse even in Paradise? They are driven out of Paradise; and what they did not there, they do on earth; so that from the very earliest days of humanity <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Paradise, and marriage by earth. <span class="stiki" id="note304448"><a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse8">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;9:8</a></span> <q>Let your garments be always white.</q> The <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> whiteness of our garments is the purity of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. In the morning we sowed our seed, and in the evening let us not cease. Let us who served marriage under the law, serve <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>30. I pass to the Song of Songs, and whereas our opponent thinks it makes altogether for marriage, I shall show that it contains the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Let us hear what the bride says before that the bridegroom comes to earth, suffers, descends to the lower world, and rises again. <q>We will make for you likenesses of gold with ornaments of silver while the king sits at his table.</q> Before the Lord rose again, and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> shone, the bride had not gold, but likenesses of gold. As for the silver, however, which she professes to have at the marriage, she not only had silver ornaments, but she had them in variety&mdash; in <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, in the continent, and in the married. Then the bridegroom makes answer to the bride, and teaches her that the shadow of the old law has passed away, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has come. <q>Rise up, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, my fair one, and come away, for lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.</q> This relates to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Once more he speaks of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>: <q>The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the pruning of vines has come.</q> Does he not seem to you to say the very same thing that the Apostle says: <span class="stiki" id="note304451"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:29</a></span> <q>The time is shortened that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none</q>? And more plainly does he herald <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note304452"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:12</a></span> <q>The voice,</q> he says, <q>of the turtle is heard in our land.</q> The turtle, the chastest of birds, always dwelling in lofty places, is a type of the Saviour. Let us read the works of naturalists and we shall find that it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the turtle-dove, if it lose its mate, not to take another; and we shall understand that second marriage is repudiated even by dumb birds. And immediately the turtle says to its fellow:  <q>The fig tree has put forth its green figs,</q> that is, the commandments of the old law have fallen, and the blossoming vines of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> give forth their fragrance.  Whence the Apostle also says, <span class="stiki" id="note304454"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> <q>We are a sweet savour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note304455"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse13">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:13-14</a></span> <q>Arise, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, my fair one, and come away. O my dove, you are in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place. Let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.</q>  Whilst you covered your countenance like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the veil of the law remained, I neither saw your face, nor did I condescend to hear your voice. I said, <span class="stiki" id="note304457"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;1:15</a></span> <q>Yea, when you make many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I will not hear.</q> But now with unveiled face behold my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and shelter yourself in the cleft and steep places of the solid rock. On hearing this the bride disclosed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note304458"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse16">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:16</a></span> <q>My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feeds his flock among the lilies,</q> that is among the pure virgin bands.

Come then, fairest bride, concerning whom it is elsewhere said <span class="stiki" id="note304464"><a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse5">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;8:5</a></span> <q>Who is she that comes up, all in white?</q> and pass on by way of this world, from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and from Sanir, which is by interpretation, <em>God of light</em>, as we read in the psalm:  <q>Your word is a lantern unto my feet, and light unto my path;</q> and <q>from Hermon,</q> that is, <em>consecration</em>: and <q>flee from the lions' dens, and the mountains of the leopards who cannot change their spots.</q> Flee, he says, from the lions' dens, flee from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of devils, that when you have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to me, I may be able to say unto you: <span class="stiki" id="note304466"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:9</a></span> <q> You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride, you have ravished mine heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck.</q> What he says is something like this&mdash; I do not reject marriage: you have a second eye, the left, which I have given to you on account of the weakness of those who cannot see the right. But I am pleased with the right eye of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and if it be blinded the whole body is in darkness. And that we might not think he had in view carnal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and bodily marriage, he at once excludes this meaning by saying <span class="stiki" id="note304467"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:9-10</a></span> <q> You have ravished my heart, my bride, my sister.</q> The name sister excludes all suspicion of unhallowed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <q>How fair are your breasts with wine,</q> those breasts concerning which he had said above, My beloved is mine, and I am his: <q>between my breasts shall he lie,</q> that is in the princely portion of the heart where the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> has its lodging. What wine is that which gives beauty to the breasts of the bride, and fills them with the milk of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>? That, forsooth, of which the bridegroom goes on to speak: <span class="stiki" id="note304468"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse1">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:1</a></span> <q>I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends: yea, drink and be drunken, my brethren.</q> Hence the Apostles also were said to be filled with new wine; with <em>new</em>, he says, not with <em>old</em> wine; because <span class="stiki" id="note304469"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;9:17</a></span> new wine is put into fresh wine-skins, and they <span class="stiki" id="note304470"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;7:6</a></span> did not walk in oldness of the letter, but in newness of the Spirit. This is wine wherewith when youths and maidens are intoxicated, they at once thirst for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; they are filled with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Zechariah comes to pass, at least if we follow the Hebrew literally, for he prophesied concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>:  <q>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. For what is his goodness, and what is his beauty, but the grain of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, and wine that gives birth to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>?</q> They are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of whom it is written in the forty-fifth psalm:  <q>The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> her companions that follow her shall be brought unto you. With <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and rejoicing shall they be led: they shall enter into the King's palace.</q></p>

<p>31. Then follows: <span class="stiki" id="note304473"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:12-13</a></span> <q>A garden shut up is my sister, my bride: a garden shut up, a fountain sealed.</q> That which is shut up and sealed reminds us of the mother of our Lord who was a mother and a Virgin. Hence it was that no one before or after our Saviour was laid in his new tomb, hewn in the solid rock. And yet she that was ever a Virgin is the mother of many <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. For next we read: <q>Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with precious fruits.</q> By pomegranates and fruits is signified the blending of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note304474"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse10">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:10</a></span> <q>My beloved is white and ruddy</q>; white in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, ruddy in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

This is not the time for me like a commentator to explain all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> from the Song of Songs; I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the fastidious reader will turn up his nose at what has already been said.</p>

<p>32. Isaiah tells of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope: <span class="stiki" id="note304478"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> <q>Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>.</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are accustomed to meet us with the objection that in Hebrew the word <em>Almah</em> does not mean a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but <em>a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</em> And, to speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is properly called <em>Bethulah</em>, but a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or a girl, is not <em>Almah</em>, but <em>Naarah!</em> What then is the meaning of <em>Almah?</em> A hidden virgin, that is, not merely virgin, but a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and something more, because not every virgin is hidden, shut off from the occasional sight of men. Then again, Rebecca, on account of her extreme purity, and because she was a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which she represented in her own <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, is described in Genesis as <em>Almah</em>, not <em>Bethulah</em>, as may clearly be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the words of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> servant, spoken by him in Mesopotamia: <q>And he said, O Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my master <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: behold I stand by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden which comes forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray you, a little water of this pitcher to drink; and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for your camels: let the same be the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom the Lord has appointed for my master's son.</q> Where he speaks of the maiden coming forth to draw water, the Hebrew word is <em>Almah</em>, that is, a <em>virgin secluded</em>, and guarded by her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> with extreme care. Or, if this be not so, let them at least show me where the word is applied to married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as well, and I will confess my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. <q>Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and bear a son.</q> If <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> be not preferred to marriage, why did not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> choose a married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>? For at that time Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser, was alive, distinguished for purity, and always free to devote herself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If the life, and good works, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> without <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> can merit the advent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, she might well have been the mother of our Lord. Let us hasten to the rest: <span class="stiki" id="note304481"><a href="../bible/isa037.htm#verse22">Isaiah&nbsp;37:22</a></span> <q>The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn.</q> To her whom he called daughter the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also gave the title virgin, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that if he spoke only of a daughter, it might be supposed that she was married. This is the virgin daughter whom elsewhere he thus addresses: <span class="stiki" id="note304482"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;54:1</a></span> <q>Sing, O barren, you that dost not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you that did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate, than the children of the married wife, says the Lord.</q> This is she of whom God by the mouth of Jeremiah speaks, saying: <span class="stiki" id="note304483"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse32">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:32</a></span> <q>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire.</q> Concerning her we read of a great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <span class="stiki" id="note304484"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse22">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:22</a></span> &mdash; that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should compass a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that the Father of all things should be contained in a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> womb.</p>

<p>33. <q>Granted,</q> says Jovinianus, <q>that there is a difference between marriage and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, what have you to say to this&mdash;Suppose a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and continued as they were, what difference will there be between them?</q> What we have already said concerning Peter and John, Anna and Mary, may be of service here. For if there is no difference between a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, both being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> makes a new man, upon the same principle harlots and prostitutes, if they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, will be equal to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. If previous marriage is no prejudice to a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and past pleasures  and the exposure of their bodies to public <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are no detriment in the case of harlots, once they have approached the laver they will gain the rewards of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. It is one thing to unite with God a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> pure and free from any stain of memory, another to remember the foul and forced embraces of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in recollection to act a part which you do not in person. Jeremiah, who was <span class="stiki" id="note304485"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:5</a></span> sanctified in the womb, and was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in his mother's belly, enjoyed the high privilege because he was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to the blessing of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. And when all were captured, and even the vessels of the temple were plundered by the King of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, he alone was liberated by the enemy, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the insults of captivity, and was supported by the conquerors; and <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, though he gave Nebuzaradan no charge concerning the Holy of Holies, did give him charge concerning Jeremiah. For that is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that is the Holy of Holies, which is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Lord by pure <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. On the other hand, Ezekiel, who was kept captive in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, who saw the <span class="stiki" id="note304487"><a href="../bible/eze001.htm#verse4">Ezekiel&nbsp;1:4</a></span> storm approaching from the north, and the whirlwind sweeping all before it, says, <span class="stiki" id="note304488"><a href="../bible/eze024.htm#verse18">Ezekiel&nbsp;24:18</a></span> <q>My wife died in the evening and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</q> For the Lord had previously told him that in that day he should open his mouth, and speak, and no longer keep silence. Mark well, that while his wife was living he was not at liberty to admonish the people. His wife died, the bond of wedlock was broken, and without the least hesitation he constantly devoted himself to the prophetic office. For he who was called being free, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the Lord's bondservant. I do not deny the blessedness of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who remain such after their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; nor do I disparage those wives who maintain their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in wedlock; but as they attain a greater reward with God than married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who pay the marriage due, let <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> themselves be content to give the preference to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. For if a <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> which comes too late, when the glow of bodily pleasure is no longer felt, makes them feel superior to married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, why should they not acknowledge themselves inferior to perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.</p>

<p>34. All that goes for nothing, says Jovinianus, because even <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, husbands of one wife, and having children, were appointed by the Apostle. Just as the Apostle <span class="stiki" id="note304489"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> says he has no commandment respecting <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and yet gives his advice, as one who had obtained mercy from the Lord, and is anxious throughout the whole discussion to give <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> the preference over marriage, and advises what he does not venture to command, lest he seem to lay a snare, and to put a heavier burden upon man's nature than it can bear; so also in establishing the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, inasmuch as the elements of the early Church were drawn from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, he made the rules for fresh <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> somewhat lighter that they might not in alarm shrink from keeping them. Then, again, the Apostles and elders wrote <span class="stiki" id="note304490"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;15:28-29</a></span> letters from Jerusalem that no heavier burden should be laid on Gentile <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> than that they should keep themselves from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and from fornication, and from things strangled. As though they were providing for infant children, they gave them milk to drink, not solid food. Nor did they lay down rules for continence, nor hint at <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, nor urge to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, nor repeat the directions  given in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the Apostles, not to have two tunics, nor scrip, nor money in their girdles, nor staff in their hand, nor shoes on their feet. And they certainly did not bid them, <span class="stiki" id="note304492"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> if they wished to be perfect, go and sell all that they had and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and <q>come follow me.</q> For if the young man who boasted of having done all that the law enjoins, when he heard this went away sorrowful, because he had great possessions, and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> derided an utterance such as this from our Lord's lips: how much more would the vast multitude of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, whose highest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consisted in not plundering another's goods, have repudiated the obligation of perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and continence, when they were told in the letter to keep themselves from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from fornication, seeing that fornication was heard of among them, and such fornication as was not <q>even among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> But the very choice of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> makes for me. For he does not say: Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be chosen who marries one wife and begets children; but who marries one wife, and  has his children in subjection and well disciplined. You surely admit that he is no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who during his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> begets children. The reverse is the case&mdash; if he be discovered, he will not be bound by the ordinary <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of a husband, but will be condemned as an adulterer. Either permit  <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to perform the work of marriage with the result that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and marriage are on a par: or if it is unlawful for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to touch their wives, they are so far <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in that they imitate virgin <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. But something more follows. A <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, or any believer, cannot <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unless he abstain from sexual intercourse. Now a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> must always offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the people: he must therefore always <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. And if he must always <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, he must always be released from the duties of marriage. For even under the old law they who used to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the people not only remained in their houses, but purified themselves for the occasion by separating from their wives, nor would they drink wine or strong drink which are wont to stimulate <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. That married men are elected to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, I do not deny: the number of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> is not so great as that of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> required. Does it follow that because all the strongest men are chosen for the army, weaker men should not be taken as well? All cannot be strong. If an army were constituted of strength only, and numbers went for nothing, the feebler men might be rejected. As it is, men of second or third-rate strength are chosen, that the army may have its full numerical complement. How is it, then, you will say, that frequently at the ordination of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is passed over, and a married man taken? Perhaps because he lacks other qualifications in keeping with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, or it may be that he is thought a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and is not: or there may be a stigma on his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, or at all events <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> itself makes him <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and while he plumes himself on mere bodily <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, he neglects other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; he does not cherish the poor: he is too fond of money. It sometimes happens that a man has a gloomy visage, a frowning brow, a walk as though he were in a solemn procession, and so offends the people, who, because they have no fault to find with his life, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> his mere dress and gait. Many are chosen not out of affection for themselves, but out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for another. In most cases the election is won by mere simplicity, while the shrewdness and discretion of another candidate elicit opposition as though they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Sometimes the judgement of the commoner people is at fault, and in testing the qualities of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the individual inclines to his own character, with the result that he looks not so much for a good candidate as for one like himself. Not unfrequently it happens that married men, who form the larger portion of the people, in approving married candidates seem to approve themselves, and it does not occur to them that the mere fact that they prefer a married person to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is evidence of their inferiority to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. What I am going to say will perhaps offend many. Yet I will say it, and good men will not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me, because they will not feel the sting of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Sometimes it is the fault of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who choose into the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> not the best, but the cleverest, men, and think the more simple as well as innocent ones incapable; or, as though they were distributing the offices of an earthly service, they give posts to their kindred and relations; or they listen to the dictates of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. And, worse than all, they give promotion to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who besmear them with flattery. To take the other view, if the Apostle's meaning be that marriage is necessary in a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Apostle himself ought not to have been a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for he said, <span class="stiki" id="note304495"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> <q>Yet I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself.</q> And John will be thought unworthy of this rank, and all the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and the continent, the fairest gems that give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and ornament to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Bishop, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, are not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> distinctions, but names of offices. And we do not read: <span class="stiki" id="note304496"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:1</a></span> <q>If a man seeks the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he desires a good degree,</q> but, <q>he desires a good work,</q> because by being placed in the higher order an opportunity is afforded him, if he choose to avail himself of it, for the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>35. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, then, must be without reproach, so that he is the slave of no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: <q>the husband of one wife,</q> that is, in the past, not in the present; <q>sober,</q> or better, as it is in the Greek, <q>vigilant,</q> that is <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C6;&#x1F71;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>; <q>chaste,</q> for that is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x1F7C;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>; <q>distinguished,</q> both by <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and conduct: <q>hospitable,</q> so that he imitates <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and with strangers, nay rather <em>in</em> strangers, entertains Christ; <q>apt to teach,</q> for it profits nothing to enjoy the consciousness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, unless a man be able to instruct the people entrusted to him, so that he can exhort in doctrine, and refute the gainsayers; <q>not a drunkard,</q> for he who is constantly in the Holy of Holies and offers <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, will not drink wine and strong drink, since wine is a luxury. If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> drink at all, let it be in such a way that no one will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether he has drunk or not. <q>No striker,</q> that is, a striker of men's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a>, for the Apostle is not pointing out what a boxer, but a pontiff ought not to do. He directly teaches what he ought to do: <q>but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money, one that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</q> See what <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is required in a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>! If his child be unchaste, he himself cannot be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and he offends God in the same way as did Eli the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who had indeed rebuked his sons, but because he had not put away the offenders, fell backwards and died before the lamp of God went out. <span class="stiki" id="note304503"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:11</a></span> <q>Women in like manner must be chaste,</q> and so on. In every grade, and in both sexes, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> has the chief place. You see then that the blessedness of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, does not lie in the fact that they are <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, but in their having the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which their names and offices imply. Otherwise, if a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> be holier than his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, his lower grade will not give him a worse standing with Christ. If it were so, Stephen the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, the first to wear the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown, would be less in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> than many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and than Timothy and Titus, whom I venture to make neither inferior nor yet superior to him. Just as in the legions of the army there are generals, tribunes, centurions, javelin-men, and light-armed troops, common soldiers, and companies, but once the battle begins, all distinctions of rank are dropped, and the one thing looked for is valour: so too in this camp and in this battle, in which we contend against devils, not names but <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are needed: and under the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> commander, Christ, not the man who has the highest title has the greatest fame, but he who is the bravest warrior.</p>

<p>36. But you will say: <q>If everybody were a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, what would become of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a></q>? Like shall here beget like. If everyone were a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, or continent in marriage, how will mortal men be propagated? Upon this principle there will be nothing at all for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that something else may cease to exist. To put a case: if all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, there would be no husbandmen. Why speak of husbandmen? There would be no orators, no lawyers, no teachers of the other professions. If all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were leaders, what would become of the soldiers? If all were the head, whose head would they be called, when there were no other members? You are afraid that if the desire for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> were general there would be no prostitutes, no adulteresses, no wailing infants in town or country. Every day the blood of adulterers  is shed, adulterers are condemned, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is raging and rampant in the very presence of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of authority and the courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Be not afraid that all will become <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>: <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is a hard matter, and therefore rare, because it is hard: <q>Many are called, few chosen.</q> Many begin, few persevere. And so the reward is great for those who have persevered. If all were able to be <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, our Lord would never have said: <span class="stiki" id="note304505"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> <q>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it:</q> and the Apostle would not have hesitated to give his advice&mdash;<span class="stiki" id="note304506"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> <q>Now concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> I have no commandment of the Lord.</q> Why then, you will say, were the organs of generation created, and why were we so fashioned by the all-wise creator, that we burn for one another, and long for natural intercourse? To reply is to endanger our modesty: we are, as it were, between two rocks, the Symplegades of necessity and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, on either side; and must make shipwreck of either our sense of shame, or of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we defend: If we reply to your suggestions, shame covers our face. If shame secures silence, in a manner we seem to desert our post, and to leave the ground clear to the raging foe. Yet it is better, as the story goes, to shut our eyes and fight like the blindfold gladiators, than not to repel with the shield of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the darts aimed at us. I can indeed say: <q>Our hinder parts which are banished from sight, and the lower portions of the abdomen, which perform the functions of nature, are the Creator's work.</q> But inasmuch as the physical conformation of the organs of generation testifies to difference of sex, I shall briefly reply: Are we never then to forego <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that we may have members of this kind for nothing? Why then should a husband keep himself from his wife? Why should a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> persevere in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, if we were only born to live like beasts? Or what harm does it do me if another man lies with my wife? For as the teeth were made for chewing, and the food masticated passes into the stomach, and a man is not blamed for giving my wife bread: similarly if it was intended that the organs of generation should always be performing their office, when my vigour is spent let another take my place, and, if I may so speak, let my wife quench her burning <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> where she can. But what does the Apostle mean by exhorting to continence, if continence be contrary to nature? What does our Lord mean when He instructs us in the various kinds of eunuchs. <span class="stiki" id="note304509"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> Surely <span class="stiki" id="note304510"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> the Apostle who bids us emulate his own <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, must be asked, if we are to be consistent, Why are you like other men, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Why are you distinguished from the female sex by a beard, hair, and other peculiarities of person? How is it that you have not swelling bosoms, and are not broad at the hips, narrow at the chest? Your voice is rugged, your speech rough, your eyebrows more shaggy. To no purpose you have all these manly qualities, if you forego the embraces of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. I am compelled to say something and become a fool: but you have forced me to dare to speak. Our Lord and Saviour, <span class="stiki" id="note304511"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6-8</a></span> Who though He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, condescended to take the form of a servant, and became <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the Father even unto death, yea the death of the cross&mdash; what necessity was there for Him to be born with members which He was not going to use? He certainly was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> to manifest His sex. Why did he <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> John the Apostle and John the Baptist to make themselves eunuchs through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Him, after causing them to be born men? Let us then who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ follow His example. And if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him after the flesh, let us no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him according to the flesh. The substance of our resurrection bodies will certainly be the same as now, though of higher <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For the Saviour after His descent into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> had so far the selfsame body in which He was crucified, that <span class="stiki" id="note304512"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;20:20</a></span> He showed the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the marks of the nails in His hands and the wound in His side. Moreover, if we deny the identity of His body because <span class="stiki" id="note304513"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;20:19</a></span> He entered though the doors were shut, and this is not a property of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, we must deny also that Peter and the Lord had real bodies because they <span class="stiki" id="note304514"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;14:28</a></span> walked upon the water, which is contrary to nature. <span class="stiki" id="note304515"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;22:30</a></span> <q>In the resurrection of the dead they will neither marry nor be given in marriage, but will be like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> What others will hereafter be in heaven, that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> begin to be on earth.

<p>37. But why do we argue, and why are we eager to frame a clever and victorious reply to our opponent? <span class="stiki" id="note304516"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> <q>Old things have passed away, behold all things have become new.</q> I will run through the utterances of the Apostles, and as to the instances afforded by Solomon I added short expositions to facilitate their being understood, so now I will go over the passages bearing on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> purity and continence, and will make of many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> a connected series. By this method I shall succeed in omitting nothing relating to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and shall avoid being tediously long. Amongst other passages, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle writes to the Romans: <span class="stiki" id="note304517"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;6:21-22</a></span> <q>What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now being made free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and become servants to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> I suppose too that the end of marriage is death. But the compensating fruit of sanctification, fruit belonging either to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> or to continence, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. And afterwards:  <q>Wherefore, my brethren, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that you should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when we were in the flesh, the sinful <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were holden; so that we serve in newness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and not in oldness of the letter.</q> <q>When,</q> he says, <q>we were in the flesh, and not in the newness of the Spirit but in the oldness of the letter,</q> we did those things which pertained to the flesh, and bore fruit unto death. But now because we are dead to the law, through the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let us bear fruit to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may belong to Him who rose from the dead. And elsewhere, having previously said,  <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the law is spiritual,</q> and having discussed at some length the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the flesh which frequently drives us to do what we would not, he at last continues: <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? I thank God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> And again, <q>So then I myself with the mind serve the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but with the flesh the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> And, <span class="stiki" id="note304520"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;8:1-2</a></span> <q>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who walk not after the flesh. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death.</q> And more clearly in what follows he teaches that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit:  <q>For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace: because the mind of the flesh is enmity against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is not subject to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither indeed can it be: and they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if so be that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in you,</q> and so on to where he says,  <q>So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: for if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the spirit ye mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the body, you shall live. For as many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, these are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> If the  wisdom of the flesh is enmity against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they who are in the flesh cannot please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I think that they who perform the functions of marriage <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the wisdom of the flesh, and therefore are in the flesh. The Apostle being desirous to withdraw us from the flesh and to join us to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, says afterwards: <span class="stiki" id="note304524"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1-3</a></span> <q>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to present your bodies a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is your reasonable service. And be not fashioned according to this world: but be transformed by the renewing of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For I say, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think according to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a></q>  (not <em>soberly</em> as the Latin versions badly render), but <q>think,</q> he says, <q>according to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>,</q> for the Greek words are <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1F76;&#x03BD;</span> . Let us consider what the Apostle says: <q>Be transformed by the renewing of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> What he says is something like this&mdash; God indeed permits marriage, He permits second marriages, and if necessary, prefers even third marriages to fornication and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. But we who ought to present our bodies a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is our reasonable service, should consider, not what God permits, but what He wishes: that we may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It follows that what He merely permits is neither good, nor acceptable, nor perfect. And he gives his reasons for this advice:  <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> the season, that now it is high time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> nearer to us than when we first <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. The night is far spent, and the day is at hand.</q> And lastly: <q>Put on the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof.</q> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is one thing, His indulgence another. Whence, writing to the Corinthians, he says,  <q>I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able. For you are yet carnal.</q> He who  is in the merely animal state, and does not receive the things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> (for he is foolish, and cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned), he is not fed with the food of perfect <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but with the coarse milk of marriage. As through man came death, so also through man came the resurrection of the dead. As in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> we all die, so in Christ we shall all be made alive. Under the law we served the old Adam, under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> let us serve the new Adam. For the first man <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the last <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made a quickening spirit.  <q>The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</q> This is so clear that no explanation can make it clearer: <q>Flesh and blood,</q> he says, <q>cannot inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</q> If corruption attaches to all intercourse, and incorruption is characteristic of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, the rewards of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> cannot belong to marriage.  <q>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that if the earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a house not made with hands, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, in the heavens. For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven. We are willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord. Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether in the body, or out of the body, to be well-pleasing unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And by way of more fully explaining what he did not wish them to be he says elsewhere: <span class="stiki" id="note304531"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span> <q>I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> But if you choose to apply the words to the whole Assembly of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and in this betrothal to Christ include both married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02561a.htm">twice-married</a>,  and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, that also makes for us. For while he invites all to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and to the reward of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, he shows that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is more excellent than all these conditions. And again writing to the Galatians he says: <span class="stiki" id="note304532"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;2:16</a></span> <q>Because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</q> Among the works of the law is marriage, and accordingly under it they are cursed who have no children. And if under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> it is permitted to have children, it is one thing to make a concession to weakness, another to hold out rewards to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>38. Something else I will say to my friends who marry and after long <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and continence begin to burn and are as wanton as the brutes: <span class="stiki" id="note304533"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse3">Galatians&nbsp;3:3-4</a></span> <q>Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, are you now perfected in the flesh? Did ye suffer so many things in vain?</q> If the Apostle in the case of some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> loosens the cords of continence, and lets them have a slack rein, he does so on account of the infirmity of the flesh. This is the enemy he has in view when he once more says: <span class="stiki" id="note304534"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;5:16-17</a></span> <q>Walk by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and you shall not fulfill the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh. For the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the Spirit against the flesh.</q> It is unnecessary now to speak of the works of the flesh: it would be tedious, and he who chooses can easily gather them from the letter of the Apostle. I will only speak of the Spirit and its fruits, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, continence. All the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Spirit are supported and protected by continence, which is as it were their solid foundation and crowning point. Against such there is no law. <span class="stiki" id="note304536"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;5:24-25</a></span> <q>And they that are of Christ have crucified their flesh with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof. If we live by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, by the Spirit let us also walk.</q> Why do we who with Christ have crucified our flesh and its <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and desires again desire to do the things of the flesh? <span class="stiki" id="note304537"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse7">Galatians&nbsp;6:7-8</a></span> <q>Whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap. For he that sows unto his own flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> I think that he who has a wife, so long as he reverts to the practice in question, that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> may not tempt him, is sowing to the flesh and not to the Spirit. And he who sows to the flesh (the words are not mine, but the Apostle's) reaps corruption. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, that we might be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and without spot before Him. <span class="stiki" id="note304538"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;2:3-4</a></span> We walked in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, even as the rest. But now He has raised us up with Him, and made us to sit with Him in the heavenly places in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note304539"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse22">Ephesians&nbsp;4:22</a></span> that we may put away according to our former manner of life the old man, which is corrupt according to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of deceit, and that blessing may be applied to us which so finely concludes the mystical Epistle to the Ephesians: <span class="stiki" id="note304540"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse24">Ephesians&nbsp;6:24</a></span> <q>Grace be with all them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> in uncorruptness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note304541"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20-21</a></span> <q>For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>: who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note304542"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;4:8</a></span> Whatsoever things then are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whatsoever are chaste, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things pertain to purity, let us join ourselves to these, let us follow these.

If then we have risen with Christ, let us seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let us set our affections on things above, not upon the things that are upon the earth. For we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>39. The day would not be long enough were I to attempt to relate all that the Apostle enjoins concerning purity. These things are those concerning which our Lord said to the Apostles: <span class="stiki" id="note304546"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;16:12-13</a></span> <q>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has come, he shall guide you into all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> After the crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we find in the  Acts of the Apostles that one house, that of Philip the Evangelist, produced four virgin daughters, to the end that C&aelig;sarea, where the Gentile Church had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the person of Cornelius the centurion, might afford an illustration of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. And whereas our Lord said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note304548"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;11:13</a></span> <q>The law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were until John,</q> they because they were <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are related to have prophesied even after John. For they could not be bound by the law of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, who had shone with the brightness of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Let us pass on to James, who was called the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, a man of such <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and righteousness, and distinguished by so rigid and perpetual a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, that even <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, the Jewish historian, relates that the overthrow of Jerusalem was due to his death. He, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Jerusalem, which was composed of Jewish <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> went, accompanied by Titus and Barnabas, says in his Epistle: <span class="stiki" id="note304550"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse16">James&nbsp;1:16-18</a></span> <q>Be not deceived, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights,  with whom there is no difference, neither shadow that is cast by turning. Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that we should be a kind of <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of his creatures.</q> Himself a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, he teaches <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Every perfect gift comes down from above, where marriage is unknown; and it comes down, not from any one you please, but from the Father of lights, Who says to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <q>You are the light of the world;</q> with Whom there is no difference of Jew, or Gentile, nor does that shadow which was the companion of the law, trouble those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> from among the nations; but with His word He begot us, and with the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because some shadow, image, and likeness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> went before in the law, that we might be the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of His creatures. And as He who was Himself the <span class="stiki" id="note304552"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse5">Revelation&nbsp;1:5</a></span> first begotten from the dead has raised all that have died in Him: so He who was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in His own virgin self. Let us also consider what Peter thinks of the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note304553"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:3-5</a></span> <q>Blessed be the God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who according to his great mercy begot us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you, who by the power of God are guarded through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unto a <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> ready to be revealed in the last time.</q> Where we read of an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, prepared in heaven and reserved for the last time, and of the hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life when they will neither marry, nor be given in marriage, there, in other words, the privileges of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> are described. For he shows as much in what follows: <span class="stiki" id="note304554"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:13-16</a></span> <q>Wherefore girding up the loins of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; as children of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, not fashioning yourselves according to your former <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> in the time of your <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; but like as he which called you is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, be ye yourselves also <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in all manner of living; because it is written, you shall be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note304555"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:18-19</a></span> For we were not redeemed with contemptible things, with silver or gold; but with the precious blood of a lamb without spot, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note304556"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:22-23</a></span> that we might purify our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, having been begotten again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  who lives and abides. And as living stones let us be built up a spiritual house, an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> offering up spiritual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> through Christ our Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note304558"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a></span> For we are an elect race, a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, a people for God's own possession. Christ died for us in the flesh. Let us arm ourselves with the same conversation as did Christ; for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that we should no longer live the rest of our time in the flesh to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the time past is sufficient for us when we walked in lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Great and precious are the promises attaching to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which He has given us, <span class="stiki" id="note304560"><a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:4</a></span> that through it we may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to deliver the godly out of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgement, but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of defilement, and despise dominion, daring, self-willed. For they, as beasts of burden, without reason, think only of their belly and their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, railers who shall in their corruption be destroyed, and shall receive the reward of iniquity: men that count unrighteousness delight, spots and blemishes, thinking  of nothing but their pleasures; having eyes full of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and insatiable <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, deceiving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> not yet strengthened by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For they utter swelling words and easily snare the unlearned with the seduction of the flesh; promising them liberty while they themselves are the slaves of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, luxury, and corruption. For of what a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage. But if, after they had escaped the defilements of the world through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, they are again overcome by that which they before overcame, the last state has become worse with them than the first. And it were better for them not to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of righteousness, than, after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, to turn back and forsake the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> commandment delivered unto them. And it has happened unto them according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> proverb, the dog has turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.</q> I have hesitated, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of being tedious, to quote the whole passage of the second Epistle of Peter, and have merely shown that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> foretold the teachers of this time and their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Lastly, he more clearly denotes them, saying, <span class="stiki" id="note304562"><a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:3</a></span> <q>In the last days seducing mockers shall come, walking after their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q></p>

<p>40. The Apostle has described Jovinianus speaking with swelling cheeks and nicely balancing his inflated utterances, promising heavenly liberty, when he himself is the slave of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and self-indulgence, a dog returning to his vomit. For although he boasts of being a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, he has exchanged his dirty tunic, bare feet, common bread, and drink of water, for a snowy dress, sleek skin, honey-wine and dainty dishes, for the sauces of Apicius and Paxamus, for baths and rubbings, and for the cook-shops. Is it not clear that he prefers his belly to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and thinks his ruddy complexion worth the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>? And yet that handsome <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> so fat and sleek, and of bright appearance, who always walks with the air of a bridegroom, must either marry a wife if he is to show that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and marriage are equal: or if he does not marry one, it is useless for him to bandy words with us when his acts are on our side. And John agrees with this almost to the letter:  <q>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of this life, which is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but is of the world.</q> And, <q>The world passes away, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof: but he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides for ever. A new commandment have I written unto you, which thing is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> both in Christ and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light already shines.</q> And again, <span class="stiki" id="note304566"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2-3</a></span> <q>Beloved, now are we the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him: for we shall see him even as he is. And every one that has this hope purifies himself, even as he is pure. Herein is our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> made perfect, if we have boldness in the day of judgement: that as he is, even so may we be in this world.</q> The Epistle of Jude also expresses nearly the same: <span class="stiki" id="note304568"><a href="../bible/jud001.htm#verse23">Jude&nbsp;23</a></span> <q>Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</q> Let us read the Apocalypse of John, and we shall there find the Lamb upon Mount Sion,  and with Him <q>a hundred and forty-four thousand of them that were sealed, having His name and the name of His Father written in their foreheads, who sing a new song, and no one can sing that song save they who have been redeemed out of the earth. These are they who have not defiled themselves with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, for they continued <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. These follow the Lamb wherever He goes: for they were redeemed from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the Lamb, and in their mouth was found no guile, and they are without spot.</q> Out of each tribe, the tribe of Dan excepted, the place of which is taken by the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who have been sealed are spoken of as future <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, who have not defiled themselves with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And that we may not suppose the reference to be to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not harlots, he immediately added: <q>For they continued <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</q> Whereby he shows that all who have not preserved their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, in comparison of pure and angelic <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself, are defiled. <span class="stiki" id="note304571"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse3">Revelation&nbsp;14:3-4</a></span> <q>These are they who sing a new song which no man can sing except him that is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. These are <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> unto God and unto the Lamb, and are without blemish.</q> If <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, it follows that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and the continent in marriage, come after the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, that is, are in the second and third rank: nor can a lost people be saved unless it offer such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with pure victims reconcile the spotless Lamb. It would be endless work to explain the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the ten <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, five of whom were wise and five foolish. All I say now is, that as mere <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> without other works does not save, so all works without <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, purity, continence, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, are imperfect. And we shall not be hindered in the least from taking this view by the objection of our opponent that our Lord was at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and joined in the marriage festivities when He turned water into wine. I shall very briefly reply, that He Who was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day, and for Whom a pair of turtle-doves and two young pigeons were offered on the day of purification, like others before He suffered, showed His approval of Jewish custom, that He might not seem to give His enemies just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for putting Him to death on the pretext that He destroyed the law and condemned nature. And even this was done for our sakes. For by going once to a marriage, He taught that men should marry only once. Moreover, at that time it was possible to injure <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> if marriage were not placed next to it, and the purity of widowhood in the third rank. But now when <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are condemning wedlock, and despise the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we gladly hear anything he  may say in praise of marriage. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not condemn marriage, but makes it subordinate; nor does she reject it, but regulates it; for she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, as was said before, that <span class="stiki" id="note304573"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:20-21</a></span> in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware; and that some are to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, some to dishonour; and that whoever cleanses himself will be a vessel of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, necessary, prepared for every good work.</p>

<p>41. I have given enough and more than enough illustrations from the divine writings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and angelic <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But as I understand that our opponent in his commentaries summons us to the tribunal of worldly wisdom, and we are told that views of this kind are never accepted in the world, and that our religion has invented a dogma against nature, I will quickly run through Greek and Roman and Foreign History, and will show that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> ever took the lead of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Fable relates that Atalanta, the virgin of Calydonian fame, lived for the chase and dwelt always in the woods; in other words that she did not set her heart on marriage with its troubles of pregnancy and of sickness, but upon the nobler life of freedom and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Harpalyce too, a Thracian virgin, is described by the famous poet; and so is Camilia, queen of the Volsci, on whom, when she came to his assistance, Turnus had no higher praise which he could bestow than to call her a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. <q>O Virgin, Glory of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>!</q> And that famous daughter of Leos, the lady of the brazen house, ever a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, is related to have freed her country from pestilence by her <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> death: and the blood of the virgin Iphigenia is said to have calmed the stormy winds. What need to tell of the Sibyls of Erythr&aelig; and Cum&aelig;, and the eight others? For Varro asserts there were ten whose ornament was <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> the reward of their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But if in the &AElig;olian dialect <q>Sibyl</q> is represented by <span class="greek">&#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03B2;&#x03BF;&#x1F7B;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;</span>, we must understand that a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <em>Counsel of God</em> is rightly attributed to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> alone. We read, too, that Cassandra and Chryseis, prophetesses of Apollo and Juno, were <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. And there were innumerable priestesses of the Taurian Diana, and of Vesta. One of these, Munitia, being suspected of unchastily was  buried alive, which would be in my opinion an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> punishment, unless the violation of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> were considered a serious crime. At all events how highly the Romans always esteemed <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> is clear from the fact that consuls and generals even in their triumphal chariots and bringing home the spoils of conquered nations, were wont to make way for them to pass. And so did men of all ranks. When Claudia, a Vestal Virgin, was suspected of unchastily, and a vessel containing the image of Cybele was aground in the Tiber, it is related that she, to prove her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, with her girdle drew the ship which a thousand men could not move. Yet, as the uncle of Lucan the poet says, it would have been better if this circumstance had decorated a <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> tried and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and had not pleaded in defence of a <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> equivocal. No wonder that we read such things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, when <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> also invented the virgin goddesses Minerva and Diana, and placed the Virgin among the twelve signs of the Zodiac, by means of which, as they suppose, the world revolves. It is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the little esteem in which they held marriage that they did not even among the scorpions, centaurs, crabs, fishes, and capricorn, thrust in a husband and wife. When the thirty tyrants of Athens had slain Phidon at the banquet, they commanded his virgin daughters to come to them, naked like harlots, and there upon the ground, red with their father's blood, to act the wanton. For a little while they hid their grief, and then when they saw the revellers were intoxicated, going out on the plea of easing nature, they embraced one another and threw themselves into a well, that by death they might save their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. The virgin daughter of Demotion, chief of the Areopagites, having heard of the death of her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, Leosthenes, who had originated the Lamian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, slew herself, for she declared that although in body she was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, yet if she were compelled to accept another, she should regard him as her second husband, when she had given her heart to Leosthenes. So close a friendship long <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> between Sparta and Messene that for the furtherance of certain religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> they even exchanged <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Well, on one occasion when the men of Messene attempted to outrage fifty Laced&aelig;monian <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, out of so many not one consented, but they all most gladly died in defence of their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Whence there arose a long and grievous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and in the long run Mamertina was destroyed. Aristoclides, tyrant of Orchomenos, fell in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of Stymphalus, and when after the death of her father she took refuge in the temple of Diana, and embraced the image of the goddess and could not be dragged thence by force, she was slain on the spot. Her death caused such intense grief throughout Arcadia that the people took up arms and avenged the virgin's death. Aristomenes of Messene, a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, at a time when the Laced&aelig;monians, whom he had conquered, were celebrating by night the festival called the Hyacinthia, carried off from the sportive bands fifteen <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and fleeing all night at full speed got away from the Spartan territory. His companions wished to outrage them, but he admonished them to the best of his power not to do so, and when certain refused to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, he slew them, and restrained the rest by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. The maidens were afterwards ransomed by their kinsmen, and on seeing Aristomenes condemned for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> would not return to their country until clasping the knees of the judges they beheld the protector of their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> acquitted. How shall we sufficiently praise the daughters of Scedasus at Leuctra in B&oelig;otia? It is related that in the absence of their father they hospitably entertained two youths who were passing by, and who having drunk to excess violated the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in the course of the night. Being unwilling to survive the loss of their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, the maidens inflicted deadly wounds on one another. Nor would it be right to omit mention of the Locrian <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. They were sent to Ilium according to custom which had lasted for nearly a thousand years, and yet not one gave occasion to any idle tale or filthy rumour of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> defiled. Could any one pass over in silence the seven <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of Miletus who, when the Gauls spread desolation far and wide, that they might suffer no indignity at the hands of the enemy, escaped disgrace by death, and left to all <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> the lesson of their example&mdash; that noble minds care more for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> than life? Nicanor having conquered and overthrown Thebes was himself overcome by a passion for one captive virgin, whose <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> self-surrender he longed for. A captive maid, he thought, must be only too glad. But he found that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is dearer to the pure in heart than a kingdom, when with tears and grief he held her in his arms slain by her own hand. Greek writers tell also of another Theban virgin who had been deflowered by a Macedonian foe, and who, hiding her grief for a while, slew the violator of her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as he slept, and then killed herself with the sword, so that she would neither live when her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> was lost, nor die before she had avenged herself.</p>

<p>42. To come to the Gymnosophists of India, the opinion is authoritatively handed down that Budda, the founder of their religion, had his birth through the side of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. And we need not wonder at this in the case of Barbarians when cultured Greece supposed that Minerva at her birth sprang from the head of Jove, and Father Bacchus from his thigh. Speusippus also, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> nephew, and Clearchus in his eulogy of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and Anaxelides in the second book of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, relates that Perictione, the mother of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, was violated by an apparition of Apollo, and they agree in thinking that the prince of wisdom was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Tim&aelig;us writes that the virgin daughter of Pythagoras was at the head of a band of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and instructed them in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Diodorus, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Socrates, is said to have had five daughters skilled in dialectics and distinguished for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, of whom a full account is given by Philo the master of Carneades. And mighty Rome cannot taunt us as though we had invented the story of the birth of our Lord and Saviour from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; for the Romans <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the founders of their city and race were the offspring of the virgin Ilia and of Mars.</p>

<p>43. Let these allusions to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> of the world, brief and hastily gathered from many histories, now suffice. I will proceed to married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who were reluctant to survive the decease or violent death of their husbands for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> they might be forced into a second marriage, and who entertained a marvellous affection for the only husbands they had. This may teach us that second marriage was repudiated among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. Dido, the sister of Pygmalion, having collected a vast amount of gold and silver, sailed to Africa, and there built <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. And when her hand was sought in marriage by Iarbas, king of Libya, she deferred the marriage for a while until her country was settled. Not long after, having raised a funeral pyre to the memory of her former husband Sich&aelig;us, she preferred to <q>burn rather than to marry.</q> <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> was built by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and its end was a tribute to the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For the wife of Hasdrubal, when the city was captured and set on fire, and she saw that she could not herself escape capture by the Romans, took her little children in either hand and leaped into the burning ruins of her house.</p>

<p>44. What need to tell of the wife of Niceratus, who, not enduring to wrong her husband, inflicted death upon herself rather than subject herself to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the thirty tyrants whom Lysander had set over conquered Athens? Artemisia, also, wife of Mausolus, is related to have been distinguished for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Though she was queen of Caria, and is extolled by great poets and historians, no higher praise is bestowed upon her than that when her husband was dead she loved him as much as when he was alive, and built a tomb so great that even to the present day all costly sepulchres are called after his name, <em>mausoleums</em>. Teuta, queen of the Illyrians, owed her long sway over brave warriors, and her frequent victories over Rome, to her marvellous <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. The Indians and almost all the Barbarians have a plurality of wives. It is a law with them that the favourite wife must be burned with her dead husband. The wives therefore vie with one another for the husband's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the highest ambition of the rivals, and the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, is to be considered worthy of death. So then she that is victorious, having put on her former dress and ornaments, lies down beside the corpse, embracing and kissing it, and to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> despises the flames which are burning beneath her. I suppose that she who dies thus, wants no second marriage. The famous Alcibiades, the friend of Socrates, when Athens was conquered, fled to Pharnabazus, who took a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> from Lysander the Laced&aelig;monian leader and ordered him to be slain. He was strangled, and when his head had been cut off it was sent to Lysander as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, but the rest of his body lay unburied. His concubine, therefore, all alone, in defiance of the command of the cruel enemy, in the midst of strangers, and in the face of peril, gave him due burial, for she was ready to die for the dead man whom she had loved when living. Let matrons, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> matrons at all events, imitate the fidelity of concubines, and exhibit in their freedom what she in her captivity preserved.</p>

<p>45. Strato, ruler of Sidon, thought of dying by his own hand, that he might not be the sport of the Persians, who were close by and whose alliance he had discarded for the friendship of the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. But he drew back in terror, and eying the sword which he had seized, awaited in alarm the approach of the enemy. His wife, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he must be immediately taken, wrested the weapon from his hand, and pierced his side. When the body was properly laid out she lay down upon it in the agony of death, that she might not violate her virgin troth in the embraces of another. Xenophon, in describing the early years of the elder Cyrus, relates that when her husband Abradatas was slain, Panthea who had loved him intensely, placed herself beside the mangled body, then stabbed herself, and let her blood run into her husband's wounds. The queen whom the king her husband had shown naked and without her <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to his friend, thought she had good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for slaying the king. She judged that she was not beloved if it was possible for her to be exhibited to another. Rhodogune, daughter of Darius, after the death of her husband, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> the nurse who was trying to persuade her to marry again. Alcestis is related in story to have voluntarily died for Admetus, and Penelope's <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is the theme of Homer's song. Laodamia's praises are also sung by the poets, because, when Protesilaus was slain at Troy, she refused to survive him.</p>

<p>46. I may pass on to Roman <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and the first that I shall mention is Lucretia, who would not survive her violated <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but blotted out the stain upon her person with her own blood. Duilius, the first Roman who won a naval triumph, took to wife a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, Bilia, of such extraordinary <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> that she was an example even to an age which held unchastity to be not merely vicious but monstrous. When he was grown old and feeble he was once in the course of a quarrel taunted with having bad breath. In dudgeon he betook himself home, and on complaining to his wife that she had never told him of it so that he might remedy the fault, he received the reply that she would have done so, but she thought that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> had foul breath as he had. In either case this chaste and noble <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> deserves praise, whether she was not aware there was anything wrong with her husband, or if she patiently endured, and her husband discovered his unfortunate condition not by the disgust of a wife, but by the abuse of an enemy. At all events the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who marries a second time cannot say this. Marcia, Cato's younger daughter, on being asked after the loss of her husband why she did not marry again, replied that she could not find a man who wanted her more than her money. Her words teach us that men in choosing their wives look for riches rather than for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and that many in marrying use not their eyes but their fingers. That <em>must</em> be an excellent thing which is won by <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>! When the same lady was mourning the loss of her husband, and the matrons asked what day would terminate her grief, she replied, <q>The same that terminates my life.</q> I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who thus followed her husband in heart and mind had no thought of marrying again. Porcia, whom Brutus took to wife, was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; Cato's wife, Marcia, was not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; but Marcia went to and fro between Hortensius and Cato, and was quite content to live without Cato; while Porcia could not live without Brutus; for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> attach themselves closely to particular men, and to keep to one is a strong link in the chain of affection. When a relative urged Annia to marry again (she was of full age and a goodly person), she answered, <q>I shall certainly not do so. For, if I find a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, I have no wish to be in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of losing him: if a bad one, why must I put up with a bad husband after having had a good one?</q> Porcia the younger, on hearing a certain lady of good character, who had a second husband, praised in her house, replied, <q>A chaste and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> matron never marries more than once.</q> Marcella the elder, on being asked by her mother if she was glad she was married, answered, <q>So much so that I want nothing more.</q> Valeria, sister of the Messalas, when she lost her husband Servius, would marry no one else. On being asked why not, she said that to her, her husband Servius was ever alive.</p>

<p>47. I feel that in giving this list of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> I have said far more than is customary in illustrating a point, and that I might be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> censured by my learned reader. But what am I to do when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of our time press me with apostolic authority, and before the first husband is buried, repeat from morning to night the precepts which allow a second marriage? Seeing they despise the fidelity which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> purity dictates, let them at least learn <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. A book <em>On Marriage</em>, worth its weight in gold, passes under the name of Theophrastus. In it the author asks whether a wise man marries. And after laying down the conditions&mdash; that the wife must be fair, of good character, and honest parentage, the husband in good health and of ample means, and after saying that under these circumstances a wise man sometimes enters the state of matrimony, he immediately proceeds thus: <q>But all these conditions are seldom satisfied in marriage. A wise man therefore must not take a wife. For in the first place his study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> will be hindered, and it is impossible for anyone to attend to his books and his wife. Matrons want many things, costly dresses, gold, jewels, great outlay, maid-servants, all kinds of furniture, litters and gilded coaches. Then come curtain-lectures the livelong night: she complains that one lady goes out better dressed than she: that another is looked up to by all: 'I am a poor despised nobody at the ladies' assemblies.' 'Why did you ogle that creature next door?' 'Why were you talking to the maid?' 'What did you bring from the market?' 'I am not allowed to have a single friend, or companion.' She suspects that her husband's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> goes the same way as her <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. There may be in some neighbouring city the wisest of teachers; but if we have a wife we can neither leave her behind, nor take the burden with us. To support a poor wife, is hard: to put up with a rich one, is torture. Notice, too, that in the case of a wife you cannot pick and choose: you must take her as you find her. If she has a bad temper, or is a fool, if she has a blemish, or is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, or has bad breath, whatever her fault may be&mdash; all this we learn after marriage. Horses, asses, cattle, even slaves of the smallest worth, clothes, kettles, wooden seats, cups, and earthenware pitchers, are first tried and then bought: a wife is the only thing that is not shown before she is married, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> she may not give satisfaction. Our gaze must always be directed to her face, and we must always praise her beauty: if you look at another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, she thinks that she is out of favour. She must be called my lady, her birth-day must be kept, we must <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by her health and wish that she may survive us, respect must be paid to the nurse, to the nursemaid, to the father's slave, to the foster-child, to the handsome hanger-on, to the curled darling who manages her affairs, and to the eunuch who ministers to the safe indulgence of her <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: names which are only a cloak for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Upon whomsoever she sets her heart, they must have her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> though they want her not. If you give her the management of the whole house, you must yourself be her slave. If you reserve something for yourself, she will not think you are loyal to her; but she will turn to strife and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and unless you quickly take care, she will have the poison ready. If you introduce old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and soothsayers, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and vendors of jewels and silken clothing, you imperil her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; if you shut the door upon them, she is injured and fancies you suspect her. But what is the good of even a careful guardian, when an unchaste wife cannot be watched, and a chaste one ought not to be? For necessity is but a faithless keeper of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and she alone really deserves to be called pure, who is free to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if she chooses. If a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be fair, she soon finds lovers; if she be ugly, it is easy to be wanton. It is difficult to guard what many long for. It is annoying to have what no one thinks worth possessing. But the misery of having an ugly wife is less than that of watching a comely one. Nothing is safe, for which a whole people sighs and longs. One man entices with his figure, another with his brains, another with his wit, another with his open hand. Somehow, or sometime, the fortress is captured which is attacked on all sides. Men marry, indeed, so as to get a manager for the house, to solace weariness, to banish solitude; but a faithful slave is a far better manager, more submissive to the master, more observant of his ways, than a wife who thinks she proves herself mistress if she acts in opposition to her husband, that is, if she does what pleases her, not what she is commanded. But friends, and servants who are under the obligation of benefits received, are better able to wait upon us in sickness than a wife who makes us responsible for her tears (she will sell you enough to make a deluge for the hope of a legacy), boasts of her anxiety, but drives her sick husband to the distraction of despair. But if she herself is poorly, we must fall sick with her and never leave her bedside. Or if she be a good and agreeable wife (how rare a bird she is!), we have to share her groans in childbirth, and suffer torture when she is in danger. A wise man can never be alone. He has with him the good men of all time, and turns his mind freely wherever he chooses. What is inaccessible to him in person he can embrace in thought. And, if men are scarce, he converses with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He is never less alone than when alone. Then again, to marry for the sake of children, so that our name may not perish, or that we may have support in old age, and leave our property without dispute, is the height of stupidity. For what is it to us when we are leaving the world if another bears our name, when even a son does not all at once take his father's title, and there are countless others who are called by the same name. Or what support in old age is he whom you bring up, and who may die before you, or turn out a reprobate? Or at all events when he reaches mature age, you may seem to him long in dying. Friends and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> whom you can judiciously <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> are better and safer heirs than those whom you must make your heirs whether you like it or not. Indeed, the surest way of having a good heir is to ruin your fortune in a good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> while you live, not to leave the fruit of your labour to be used you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how.</q></p>

<p>48. When Theophrastus thus discourses, are there any of us, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whose conversation is in heaven and who daily say <span class="stiki" id="note304612"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> <q>I long to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,</q> whom he does not put to the blush? Shall a joint-heir of Christ really long for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heirs? And shall he desire children and delight himself in a long line of descendants, who will perhaps fall into the clutches of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, when we read that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Samuel preferred other men to their own sons, and did not count as their children those whom they saw to be displeasing to God? When Cicero after  <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> Terentia was requested by Hirtius to marry his sister, he  set the matter altogether on one side, and said that he could not possibly devote himself to a wife and to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Meanwhile that excellent partner, who had herself drunk wisdom at Tully's fountains, married  Sallust his enemy, and took for her third husband Messala Corvinus, and thus, as it were, passed through three degrees of eloquence. Socrates had two wives, Xantippe and Myron, grand-daughter of Aristides. They frequently quarrelled, and he was accustomed to banter them for disagreeing about him, he being the ugliest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, with snub nose, bald forehead, rough-haired, and bandy-legged. At last they planned an attack upon him, and having punished him severely, and put him to flight, vexed him for a long time. On one occasion when he opposed Xantippe; who from above was heaping abuse upon him, the termagant soused him with dirty water, but he only wiped his head and said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that a shower must follow such thunder as that.</q> Metella, consort of L. Sulla the Fortunate (except in the matter of his wife) was  openly unchaste. It was the common talk of Athens, as I learned in my youthful years when we soon pick up what is bad, and yet Sulla was in the dark, and first got to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the secrets of his household through the abuse of his enemies. Cn. Pompey had an impure wife  Mucia, who was surrounded by eunuchs from <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and troops of the countrymen of Mithridates. Others thought that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all and submitted to it; but a comrade told him during the campaign, and the conqueror of the whole world was dismayed at the sad intelligence. M. Cato, the Censor, had a wife Actoria Paula, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of low origin, fond of drink, violent, and (who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it?) <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> to Cato. I say this for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> anyone may suppose that in marrying a poor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he has secured peace. When Philip king of Macedon, against whom Demosthenes thundered in his Philippics, was entering his bed-room as usual, his wife in a passion shut him out. Finding himself excluded he held his tongue, and consoled himself for the insult by reading a tragic poem. Gorgias the Rhetorician recited his excellent treatise on Concord to the Greeks, then at variance among themselves, at Olympia. Whereupon Melanthius his enemy observed: <q>Here is a man who teaches us concord, and yet could not make concord between himself his wife, and maid-servant, three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in one house.</q> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was that his wife envied the beauty of the girl, and drove the purest of men wild with daily quarrels. Whole tragedies of Euripides are censures on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Hence Hermione says,  <q>The counsels of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have beguiled me.</q> In the semi-barbarous and remote city Leptis it is the custom for a daughter-in-law on  the second day to beg the loan of a jar from her mother-in-law. The latter at once denies the request, and we see how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> was the remark of Terence, ambiguously expressed on purpose&mdash; <q>How is this? Do all mothers-in-law <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> their daughters-in-law?</q> We read of a certain Roman noble who, when his friends found fault with him for having <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> a wife, beautiful, chaste, and rich, put out his foot and said to them, <q>And the shoe before you looks new and elegant, yet no one but myself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> where it pinches.</q> Herodotus  tells us that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> puts off her modesty with her clothes. And our own comic poet  thinks the man fortunate who has never been married. Why should I refer to Pasipha&euml;,  Clytemnestra, and Eriphyle, the first of whom, the wife of a king and swimming in pleasure, is said to have lusted for a bull, the second to have killed her: husband for the sake of an adulterer, the third to have betrayed Amphiaraus, and to have preferred a gold necklace to the welfare of her husband. In all the bombast of tragedy and the overthrow of houses, cities, and kingdoms, it is the wives and concubines who stir up strife. Parents take up arms against their children: unspeakable banquets are served: and on account of the rape of one wretched <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and Asia are involved in a ten years' <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. We read of some who were <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> the day after they were married, and immediately married again. Both husbands are to blame, both he who was so soon dissatisfied, and he who was so soon pleased. <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> the patron of pleasure (though Metrodorus his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> married Leontia) says that a wise man can seldom marry, because marriage has many drawbacks. And as riches, honours, bodily health, and other things which we call indifferent, are neither good nor bad, but stand as it were midway, and become good and bad according to the use and issue, so wives stand on the border line of good and ill. It is, moreover, a serious matter for a wise man to be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether he is going to marry a good or a bad <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Chrysippus ridiculously maintains that a wise man should marry, that he may not outrage Jupiter  Gamelius and Genethlius. For upon that principle the Latins would not marry at all, since they have no Jupiter who presides over marriage. But if, as he thinks, the life of men is determined by the names of gods, whoever chooses to sit will offend Jupiter  Stator.</p>

<p>49. Aristotle and Plutarch and our Seneca have written treatises on matrimony, out of which we have already made some extracts and now add a few more. <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of beauty is the forgetting of reason and the near neighbour of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; a foul blot little in keeping with a sound mind. It confuses counsel, breaks high and generous spirits, draws away men from great thoughts to mean ones; it makes men querulous, ill-tempered, foolhardy, cruelly imperious, servile flatterers, good for nothing, at last not even for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself. For although in the intensity of passion it burns like a raging fire, it wastes much time through suspicions, tears, and complaints: it begets <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of itself, and at last <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> itself.</q> The course of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is laid bare in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> Ph&aelig;drus from beginning to end, and Lysias explains all its drawbacks&mdash; how it is led not by reason, but by frenzy, and in particular is a harsh jailer over lovely wives. Seneca, too, relates that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> an accomplished man who before going out used to tie his wife's garter upon his breast, and could not bear to be absent from her for a quarter of an hour; and this pair would never take a drink unless husband and wife alternately put their lips to the cup; and they did other things just as absurd in the extravagant outbursts of their warm but blind affection. Their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> birth, but it grew out of all proportion. And it makes no difference how <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> may be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a man's insanity. Hence Xystus in his Sentences tells us that <q>He who too ardently loves his own wife is an adulterer.</q> It is disgraceful to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> another man's wife at all, or one's own too much. A wise man ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his wife with judgment, not with passion. Let a man govern his voluptuous impulses, and not rush headlong into intercourse. There is nothing blacker than to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a wife as if she were an adulteress. Men who say they have contracted marriage and are bringing up children, for the good of their country and of the race, should at least imitate the brutes, and not destroy their offspring in the womb; nor should they appear in the character of lovers, but of husbands. In some cases marriage has grown out of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: and, shameful to relate! men have tried to teach their wives <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> after having taken their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> away. Marriages of that sort are quickly dissolved when <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is satiated. The first allurement gone, the charm is lost. What shall I say, says Seneca, of the poor men who in numbers are <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a> to take the name of husband in order to evade the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> promulgated against bachelors? How can he who is married under such conditions be a guide to morality, teach <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and maintain the authority of a husband? It is the saying of a very learned man, that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> must be preserved at all costs, and that when it is lost all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> falls to the ground. This holds the primacy of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. This it is that makes up for a wife's poverty, enhances her riches, redeems her deformity, gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to her beauty; it makes her act in a way worthy of her forefathers whose blood it does not taint with bastard offspring; of her children, who through it have no need to blush for their mother, or to be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about their father; and above all, of herself, since it defends her from external violation. There is no greater calamity connected with captivity than to be the victim of another's <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. The consulship sheds lustre upon men; eloquence gives <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> renown; military <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and a triumph immortalise an obscure <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Many are the spheres ennobled by splendid ability. The <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is, in a special sense, purity. It was this that made Lucretia the equal of Brutus, if it did not make her his superior, since Brutus learned from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the impossibility of being a slave. It was this that made Cornelia a fit match for Gracchus, and Porcia for a second Brutus. Tanaquil is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> than her husband. His name, like the names of many other kings, is lost in the mists of antiquity. She, through a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rare among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, is too deeply rooted in the hearts of all ages for her memory ever to perish. Let my married sisters copy the examples of Theano, Cleobuline, Gorgente, Timoclia, the Claudias and Cornelias; and when they find the Apostle conceding second marriage to depraved <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, they will read that before the light of our religion shone upon the world wives of one husband ever held high rank among matrons, that by their hands the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of Fortuna  Muliebris were performed, that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or Flamen twice  married was unknown, that the high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Athens to this day  emasculate themselves by drinking hemlock, and once they have been drawn in to the pontificate, cease to be men.</p>
