<h1>Against Marcion, Book IV</h1>

<p><strong>In Which Tertullian Pursues His Argument. Jesus is the Christ of the Creator. He Derives His Proofs from St. Luke's Gospel; That Being the Only Historical Portion of the New Testament Partially Accepted by Marcion. This Book May Also Be Regarded as a Commentary on St. Luke. It Gives Remarkable Proof of Tertullian's Grasp of Scripture, and Proves that <q>The Old Testament is Not Contrary to the New.</q> It Also Abounds in Striking Expositions of Scriptural Passages, Embracing Profound Views of Revelation, in Connection with the Nature of Man.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Examination of the Antitheses of Marcion, Bringing Them to the Test of Marcion's Own Gospel. Certain True Antitheses in the Dispensations of the Old and the New Testaments. These Variations Quite Compatible with One and the Same God, Who Ordered Them.</h2>

<p>Every opinion and the whole scheme  of the impious and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> we now bring to the test  of that very <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which, by his process of interpolation, he has made his own. To encourage a belief <em>of this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em> he has actually  devised for it a sort of dower,  in a work composed of contrary statements set in opposition, thence entitled <em>Antitheses</em>, and compiled with a view to such a severance of the law from the gospel as should divide the Deity into two, nay, diverse, gods&mdash; one for each Instrument, or Testament  as it is more usual to call it; that by such means he might also patronize  belief in <q>the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to the Antitheses.</q> These, however, I would have attacked in special combat, hand to hand; that is to say, I would have encountered singly the several devices of the Pontic <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, if it were not much more convenient to refute them in and with that very gospel to which they contribute their support. Although it is so easy to meet them at once with a peremptory demurrer,  yet, in order that I may both make them admissible in argument, and account them valid expressions of opinion, and even contend that they make for our side, that so there may be all the redder shame for the blindness of their author, we have now drawn out some <em>antitheses</em> of our own in opposition to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. And indeed  I do allow that one order did run its course in the old dispensation under the Creator,  and that another is on its way in the new under Christ. I do not deny that there is a difference in the language of their documents, in their precepts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and in their teachings of the law; but yet all this diversity is consistent with one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Him by whom it was arranged and also foretold. Long ago  did Isaiah declare that <q>out of Sion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033491"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;2:3</a></span> &mdash; some other law, that is, and another word. In short, says he, <q>He shall judge among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and shall rebuke many people;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033492"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;2:4</a></span> meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and are among themselves rebuked of their old <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as soon as they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And as the result of this, <q>they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting instruments) into pruning-hooks;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033493"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;2:4</a></span> that is to say, minds, which once were fierce and cruel, are changed by them into good dispositions productive of good fruit. And again: <q>Hearken unto me, hearken unto me, my people, and you kings, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment for a light to the nations;</q>  wherefore He had determined and decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the word of the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is unblameable, because <q>perfect, converting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></q>  from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This likewise will be the word concerning which the same Isaiah says, <q>For the Lord will make a decisive word in the land.</q>  Because the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is compendiously short,  and freed from the minute and perplexing  burdens of the law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foretells the renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself? <q>Remember not the former things, neither consider the things of old</q> (the old things have passed away, and new things are arising). <q>Behold, I will do new things, which shall now spring forth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033499"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;43:18-19</a></span> So by Jeremiah: <q>Break up for yourselves new pastures,  and sow not among thorns, and circumcise yourselves in the foreskin of your heart.</q>  And in another passage: <q>Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Jacob, and with the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I arrested their dispensation, in order to bring them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q>  He thus shows that the ancient covenant is temporary only, when He indicates its change; also when He promises that it shall be followed by an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> one. For by Isaiah He says: <q>Hear me, and you shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,</q> adding <q>the sure mercies of David,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033503"><a href="../bible/isa055.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;55:3</a></span> in order that He might show that that covenant was to run its course in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. That He was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, according to the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>,  He declared in a figurative way even by the rod which was to proceed out of the stem of Jesse. <span class="stiki" id="note033505"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;11:1</a></span> Forasmuch then as he said, that from the Creator there would come other <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and other words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the very <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were to receive higher offices, and <em>that</em> among all nations, by Malachi when he says: <q>I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord, neither will I accept your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and in every place a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is offered unto my name, even a pure offering</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033506"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;1:10-11</a></span> &mdash; meaning simple <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>&mdash;it is of necessity that every change which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those things of which <em>the change</em> is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For as there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become different, so there is nothing different which is not contrary.  Of that very thing, therefore, there will be predicated a contrariety in consequence of its diversity, to which there accrued a change of condition after an innovation. He who brought about the change, the same instituted the diversity also; He who foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety likewise. Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of things to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator's prejudice those examples from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in His sensations and affections? <q>I will wound,</q> He says, <q>and I will heal;</q> <q>I will kill,</q> He says again, <q>and I will make alive</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033508"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:39</a></span> &mdash; even the same <q>who creates <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and makes peace;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033509"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;45:7</a></span> from which you are used even to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if He forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you not reckoned up the <em>Antitheses</em> also which occur in the natural works of the Creator, who is for ever contrary to Himself? You have not been able, unless I am misinformed, to recognise the fact,  that the world, at all events,  even among your people of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, is made up of a diversity of elements which are hostile to one another.  It was therefore your bounden duty first to have determined that the god of the light was one being, and the god of darkness was another, in such wise that you might have been able to have distinctly asserted one of them to be the god of the law and the other the god of the gospel. It is, however, the settled conviction already  of my mind from manifest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, that, as His works and plans  exist in the way of <em>Antitheses</em>, so also by the same rule exist the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of His religion. </p>

<h2>Chapter 2. St. Luke's Gospel, Selected by Marcion as His Authority, and Mutilated by Him. The Other Gospels Equally Authoritative. Marcion's Terms of Discussion, However, Accepted, and Grappled with on the Footing of St. Luke's Gospel Alone.</h2>

<p>You have now our answer to the <em>Antitheses</em> compendiously indicated by us.  I pass on to give a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> &mdash; not, to be sure, of Jewry, but of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>&mdash; having become meanwhile  adulterated; and this shall indicate  the order by which we proceed. We lay it down as our first position, that the evangelical Testament  has <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for its authors,  to whom was assigned by the Lord Himself this office of publishing the gospel. Since, however, there are apostolic  men also,  they are yet not alone, but appear with <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and after <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; because the preaching of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> might be open to the suspicion of an affectation of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, if there did not accompany it  the authority of the masters, which means that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  for it was that which made the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> their masters. Of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, therefore, John and Matthew first instil  <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> into us; while of apostolic men, Luke and Mark renew it afterwards.  These all start with the same principles of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  so far as relates to the one only God the Creator and His Christ, how that He was born of the Virgin, and came to fulfil  the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Never mind  if there does occur some variation in the order of their narratives, provided that there be agreement in the essential matter  of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in which there is disagreement with <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, on the other hand, you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,  ascribes no author to his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, as if it could not be allowed him to affix a title to that from which it was no crime (in his eyes) to subvert  the very body. And here I might now make a stand, and contend that a work ought not to be recognised, which holds not its head erect, which exhibits no consistency, which gives no promise of credibility from the fullness of its title and the just profession of its author. But we prefer to join issue  on every point; nor shall we leave unnoticed  what may fairly be understood to be on our side.  Now, of the authors whom we possess, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> seems to have singled out Luke  for his mutilating process.  Luke, however, was not an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, but only an apostolic man; not a master, but a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and so inferior to a master&mdash; at least as far subsequent to  him as the apostle whom he followed (and that, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> ) was subsequent to the others; so that, had <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> even published his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the name of St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself, the single authority of the document,  destitute of all support from preceding authorities, would not be a sufficient basis for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. There would be still wanted that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> found in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, to which he yielded his belief, and with which he so earnestly wished his own to agree, that he actually on that account went up to Jerusalem to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and consult the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <q>lest he should run, or had been running in vain;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033542"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> in other words, that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he had learned, and the gospel which he was preaching, might be in accordance with theirs. Then, at last, having conferred with the (primitive) authors, and having agreed with them touching the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they joined their hands in fellowship, and divided their labours thenceforth in the office of preaching the gospel, so that they were to go to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Inasmuch, therefore, as the enlightener of St. Luke himself desired the authority of his predecessors for both his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and preaching, how much more may not I require for Luke's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that which was necessary for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of his master. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. &mdash; Marcion Insinuated the Untrustworthiness of Certain Apostles Whom St. Paul Rebuked. The Rebuke Shows that It Cannot Be Regarded as Derogating from Their Authority. The Apostolic Gospels Perfectly Authentic.</h2>

<p>In the scheme of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, on the contrary,  the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> begins from the discipleship of Luke. Since, however, it was on its course previous to that point, it must have had  its own authentic materials,  by means of which it found its own way down to St. Luke; and by the assistance of the testimony which it bore, Luke himself becomes admissible. Well, but  <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, finding the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Galatians (wherein he rebukes even <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> ) for <q>not walking uprightly according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel,</q>  as well as accuses certain false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of perverting the gospel of Christ), labours very hard to destroy the character  of those <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> which are published as genuine  and under the name of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in order, forsooth, to secure for his own <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the credit which he takes away from them. But then, even if he censures Peter and John and James, who were thought to be pillars, it is for a manifest reason. They seemed to be changing their company  from respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. And yet as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself <q>became all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033555"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:22</a></span> that he might gain all, it was possible that Peter also might have betaken himself to the same plan of practising somewhat different from what he taught. And, in like manner, if false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also crept in, their character too showed itself in their insisting upon <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the Jewish ceremonies. So that it was not on account of their preaching, but of their conversation, that they were marked by St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who would with equal impartiality have marked them with censure, if they had erred at all with respect to God the Creator or His Christ. Each several case will therefore have to be distinguished. When <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> complains that <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are suspected (for their prevarication and dissimulation) of having even depraved the gospel, he thereby accuses Christ, by accusing those whom Christ chose. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who are censured simply for inconsistency of walk, composed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in a pure form,  but false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> interpolated their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> record; and if our own copies have been made from these,  where will that genuine text  of the apostle's writings be found which has not suffered adulteration? Which was it that enlightened <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and through him Luke? It is either completely blotted out, as if by some deluge&mdash; being obliterated by the inundation of falsifiers&mdash; in which case even <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> does not possess the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; or else, is that very <em>edition</em> which <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> alone possesses <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? How, then, does that agree with ours, which is said not to be (the work) of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but of Luke? Or else, again, if that which <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> uses is not to be attributed to Luke simply because it does agree with ours (which, of course,  is, also adulterated in its title), then it is the work of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Our <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, therefore, which is in agreement with it, is equally the work of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but also adulterated in its title. </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Each Side Claims to Possess the True Gospel. Antiquity the Criterion of Truth in Such a Matter. Marcion's Pretensions as an Amender of the Gospel.</h2>

<p>We must follow, then, the clue  of our discussion, meeting every effort of our opponents with reciprocal vigor. I say that <em>my</em> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one; <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, that <em>his</em> is. I affirm that <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is adulterated; <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, that mine is. Now what is to settle the point for us, except it be that principle  of <em>time</em>, which rules that the authority lies with that which shall be found to be more ancient; and assumes as an elemental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  that corruption (of doctrine) belongs to the side which shall be convicted of comparative lateness in its origin.  For, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>  is falsification of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it must needs be that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> therefore precede <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. A thing must exist prior to its suffering any casualty;  and an object  must precede all rivalry to itself. Else how absurd it would be, that, when we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> our position to be the older one, and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> the later, ours should yet appear to be the false one, before it had even received from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> its objective <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>;  and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> should also be supposed to have experienced rivalry at our hands, even before its publication; and, in fine, that that should be thought to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> position which is the later one&mdash; a century  later than the publication of all the many and great facts and records of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, which certainly could not have been published <em>without</em>, that is to say, <em>before</em>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel. With regard, then, to the pending  question, of Luke's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> (so far as its being the common property  of ourselves and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> enables it to be decisive of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, ) that portion of it which we alone receive  is so much older than <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> himself once <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it, when in the first warmth of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he contributed money to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church, which along with himself was afterwards rejected,  when he fell away from our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into his own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. What if the Marcionites have denied that he held the primitive <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among ourselves, in the face even of his own letter? What, if they do not acknowledge the letter? They, at any rate, receive his <em>Antitheses</em>; and more than that, they make ostentatious use  of them. Proof out of these is enough for me. For if the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, said to be Luke's which is current among us  (we shall see whether it be also current with <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>), is the very one which, as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> argues in his <em>Antitheses</em>, was interpolated by the defenders of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, for the purpose of such a conglomeration with it of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as should enable them out of it to fashion their Christ, surely he could not have so argued about it, unless he had found it (in such a form). No one censures things before they exist,  when he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not whether they will come to pass. Emendation never precedes the fault. To be sure,  an amender of that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which had been all topsy-turvy  from the days of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> to those of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>, first presented himself in <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> alone&mdash; so long looked for by Christ, who was all along regretting that he had been in so great a hurry to send out his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> without the support of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>! But for all that,  <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which is for ever mending the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and corrupting them in the act, is an affair of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> audacity, not of God's authority; and if <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> be even a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, he is yet not <q>above his master;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033581"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;10:24</a></span> if <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> be an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, still as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>Whether it be I or they, so we preach;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033582"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:11</a></span> if <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, even <q>the spirits of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> will be subject to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033583"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:32</a></span> for they are not the authors of confusion, but of peace; or if <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> be actually an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, he must rather be designated <q>as <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> than as a preacher of the gospel,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033584"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> because it is a strange gospel which he has preached. So that, while he amends, he only confirms both positions: both that our <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is the prior one, for he amends that which he has previously fallen in with; and that <em>that</em> is the later one, which, by putting it together out of the emendations of ours, he has made his own <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and a novel one too.</p>

<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5. By the Rule of Antiquity, the Catholic Gospels are Found to Be True, Including the Real St. Luke's. Marcion's Only a Mutilated Edition. The Heretic's Weakness and Inconsistency in Ignoring the Other Gospels.</h2> 

<p>On the whole, then, if that is evidently more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which is earlier, if that is earlier which is from the very beginning, if that is from the beginning which has the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> for its authors, then it will certainly be quite as evident, that that comes down from the apostles,  which has been kept as a sacred deposit  in the churches of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Let us see what milk the Corinthians drank from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; to what rule <em>of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em> the Galatians were brought for correction; what the Philippians, the Thessalonians, the Ephesians read <em>by it</em>; what utterance also the Romans give, so very near  (to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>), to whom Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> conjointly  bequeathed the gospel even sealed with their own blood. We have also <em>St.</em> John's foster churches.  For although <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> rejects his Apocalypse, the order  of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (thereof), when traced up to their origin, will yet rest on John as their author. In the same manner is recognised the excellent source  of the other churches. I say, therefore, that in them (and not simply such of them as were founded by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but in all those which are united with them in the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> <em>of the gospel of Christ</em> ) that <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Luke which we are defending with all our might has stood its ground from its very first publication; whereas <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to most people, and to none whatever is it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> without being at the same time  condemned. It too, of course,  has its churches, but specially its own&mdash; as late as they are spurious; and should you want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their original,  you will more easily discover <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> in it than apostolicity, with <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> forsooth as their founder, or some one of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> swarm.  Even wasps make combs;  so also these Marcionites make churches. The same authority of the <a href="../cathen/01634a.htm">apostolic churches</a> will afford evidence  to the other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> also, which we possess equally through their means,  and according to their usage&mdash; I mean the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> of John and Matthew&mdash; while that which Mark published may be affirmed to be Peter's  whose interpreter Mark was. For even Luke's form  of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> men usually ascribe to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.  And it may well seem  that the works which <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> publish belong to their masters. Well, then, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> ought to be called to a strict account  concerning these (other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>) also, for having omitted them, and insisted in preference  on Luke; as if they, too, had not had free course in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, as well as Luke's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, from the beginning. Nay, it is even more credible that they  <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from the very beginning; for, being the work of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, they were prior, and coeval in origin with  the churches themselves. But how comes it to pass, if the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> published nothing, that their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were more forward in such a work; for they could not have been <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, without any instruction from their masters? If, then, it be evident that these (<a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>) also were current in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, why did not <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> touch them&mdash; either to amend them if they were adulterated, or to acknowledge them if they were uncorrupt? For it is but natural  that they who were perverting the gospel, should be more solicitous about the perversion of those things whose authority they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be more generally received. Even the false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> (were so called) on this very account, because they imitated the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by means of their falsification. In <em>as</em> far, then, as he might have amended what there was to amend, if found corrupt, in <em>so</em> far did he firmly imply  that all was free from corruption which he did not think required amendment. In short,  he simply amended what he thought was corrupt; though, indeed, not even this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, because it was not really corrupt. For if the (<a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>  have come down to us in their integrity, while Luke's, which is received among us,  so far accords with their rule as to be on a par with them in permanency of reception in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, it clearly follows that Luke's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also has come down to us in like integrity until the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> treatment of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. In short, when <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> laid hands on it, it then became diverse and hostile to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. I will therefore advise his followers, that they either change these <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, however late to do so, into a conformity with their own, whereby they may seem to be in agreement with the apostolic writings (for they are daily retouching their work, as daily they are convicted by us); or else that they blush for their master, who stands self-condemned  either way&mdash; when once  he hands on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> smitten, or again  subverts it by shameless tampering. Such are the summary arguments which we use, when we take up arms  against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>  of the gospel, maintaining both that order of periods, which rules that a late date is the mark of forgers,  and that authority of churches  which lends support to the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must needs precede the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, and proceed straight from those by whom it has been handed on.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Marcion's Object in Adulterating the Gospel. No Difference Between the Christ of the Creator and the Christ of the Gospel. No Rival Christ Admissible. The Connection of the True Christ with the Dispensation of the Old Testament Asserted.</h2>

<p>But we now advance a step further on, and challenge (as we promised to do) the very <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, with the intention of thus proving that it has been adulterated. For it is certain  that the whole aim at which he has strenuously laboured even in the drawing up of his <em>Antitheses</em>, centres in this, that he may establish a diversity between the Old and the New Testaments, so that his own Christ may be separate from the Creator, as belonging to this rival god, <em>and</em> as alien from the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. It is certain, also, that with this view  he has erased everything that was contrary to his own opinion and made for the Creator, as if it had been interpolated by His advocates, while everything which agreed with his own opinion he has retained. The latter statements we shall strictly examine;  and if they shall turn out rather for our side, and shatter the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, we shall embrace them. It will then become evident, that in retaining them he has shown no less of the defect of blindness, which characterizes <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, than he displayed when he erased all the former class of subjects. Such, then, is to be  the drift and form of my little treatise; subject, of course, to whatever condition may have become requisite on both sides of the question.  <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> has laid down the position, that Christ who in the days of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> was, by a previously unknown god, revealed for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all nations, is a different being from Him who was ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Creator for the restoration of the Jewish state, and who is yet to come. Between these he interposes the separation of  a great and absolute difference&mdash; as great as lies between what is just and what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>;  as great as lies between the law and the gospel; as great, (in short,) as is the difference between <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Hence will arise also our rule,  by which we determine  that there ought to be nothing in common between the Christ of the rival god and the Creator; but that (Christ) must be pronounced to belong to the Creator,  if He has administered His dispensations, fulfilled His prophecies, promoted  His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, given reality to  His promises, revived His mighty power,  remoulded His determinations,  expressed His attributes, His properties. This law and this rule I earnestly request the reader to have ever in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and so let him begin to investigate whether Christ be <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> or the Creator's.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Marcion Rejected the Preceding Portion of St. Luke's Gospel. Therefore This Review Opens with an Examination of the Case of the Evil Spirit in the Synagogue of Capernaum. He Whom the Demon Acknowledged Was the Creator's Christ.</h2>

<p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>  (for such is <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> proposition) he <q>came down to the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a> city of Capernaum,</q> of course meaning  from the heaven of the Creator, to which he had previously descended from his own. What then had been his course,  for him to be described as first descending from his own heaven to the Creator's? For why should I abstain from censuring those parts of the statement which do not satisfy the requirement of an ordinary narrative, but always end in a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>? To be sure, our censure has been once for all expressed in the question, which we have already  suggested: Whether, when descending through the Creator's domain, and indeed in hostility to him, he could possibly have been admitted by him, and by him been transmitted to the earth, which was equally his territory? Now, however, I want also to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the remainder of his course down, assuming that he came down. For we must not be too nice in inquiring  whether it is supposed that he was <em>seen</em> in any place. To come into view  indicates  a sudden unexpected glance, which for a moment fixed  the eye upon the object that passed before the view, without staying. But when it happens that a descent has been effected, it is apparent, and comes under the notice of the eyes.  Moreover, it takes account of <em>fact</em>, and thus obliges one to examine in what condition with what preparation,  with how much <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or moderation, and further, at what time of the day or night, the descent was made; who, again, saw the descent, who reported it, who seriously avouched the fact, which certainly was not easy to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, even after the asseveration. It is, in short, too bad  that Romulus should have had in Proculus an avoucher of his ascent to heaven, when the Christ of (this) god could not find any one to announce his descent from heaven; just as if the ascent of the one and the descent of the other were not effected on one and the same ladder of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>! Then, what had he to do with <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, if he did not belong to the Creator by whom  that region was destined (for His Christ) when about to enter on His ministry?  As Isaiah says: <q>Drink in this first, and be prompt, O region of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, and you others who (inhabit) the sea-coast, and that of Jordan, <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, you people who sit in darkness, behold a great light; upon you, who inhabit (that) land, sitting in the shadow of death, the light has arisen.</q>  It is, however, well that <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god does claim to be the enlightener of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that so he might have the better reason for coming down from heaven; only, if it must needs be,  he should rather have made <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> his place of descent than <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. But since both the place and the work of illumination according to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> are compatible with Christ, we begin to discern  that He is the subject of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which shows that at the very outset <em>of His ministry</em>, He came not to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but rather to fulfil them; <span class="stiki" id="note033650"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> for <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> has erased the passage as an interpolation.  It will, however, be vain for him to deny that Christ uttered in word what He immediately did partially indeed. For the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> about place He at once fulfilled. From heaven straight to the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>. As the adage runs: <q>The business on which we have come, do at once.</q> <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> must even expunge from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033652"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;15:24</a></span> and, <q>It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033653"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;15:26</a></span> &mdash; in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the sayings of my Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>; surely (this is going) to the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Behold, it is to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> first that He offers the <q>bread</q> of His doctrine; surely it is because they are <q>children</q> that He shows them this priority.  Observe, He does not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as <q>dogs.</q> For to whom else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the Creator, if He especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have been admitted into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>&mdash; one so abruptly appearing,  so unknown; one, of whom no one had as yet been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and lastly, His enrolment in the census of Augustus&mdash; that most faithful <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Lord's nativity, kept in the archives of Rome? They certainly would have remembered, if they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, that He must not be admitted into their most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places. And even if He had the general right of entering  the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> (like other <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>), yet the function of giving instruction was allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, and for some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested elsewhere. But <q>they were all astonished at His doctrine.</q> Of course they were; for, says (St. Luke), His word was with power <span class="stiki" id="note033657"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;4:32</a></span> &mdash; not because He taught in opposition to the law and the prophets.  No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, His divine discourse  gave forth both power and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, building up rather than pulling down the substance of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Otherwise, instead of astonishment, they would feel horror. It would not be admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which they would bestow on one who was the destroyer of law and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the special propounder as a natural consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach anything to the disparagement of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and so far of the Creator also, without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity. Inasmuch, then, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> makes no other statement on the matter than that the simple force and power of His word produced astonishment, it more naturally  shows that His teaching was in accordance with the Creator by not denying (that it was so), than that it was in opposition to the Creator, by not asserting (such a fact). And thus He will either have to be acknowledged as belonging to Him,  in accordance with whom He taught; or else will have to be adjudged a deceiver since He taught in accordance with One whom He had come to oppose. In the same passage, <q>the spirit of an unclean <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></q> exclaims: <q>What have we to do with You, You Jesus? Have You come to destroy us? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You who You are, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033661"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;4:33-34</a></span> I do not here raise the question whether this appellation was suitable to one who ought not to be called Christ, unless he were sent by the Creator.  Elsewhere  there has been already given a full consideration of His titles.</p>

<p>My present discussion is, how the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit could have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that He was called by such a name, when there had never at any time been uttered about Him a single <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> by a god who was unknown, and up to that time silent, of whom it was not possible for Him to be attested as <q>the Holy One,</q> as (of a god) unknown even to his own Creator. What similar <em>event</em> could he then have published  of a <em>new</em> deity, whereby he might betoken for <q>the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one</q> of the rival god? Simply that he went into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and did nothing even in word against the Creator? As therefore he could not by any means acknowledge him, whom he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, to be Jesus and the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so did he acknowledge Him whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> (to be both). For he remembered how that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had prophesied  of <q>the Holy One</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how that God's name of <q>Jesus</q> was in the son of Nun.  These facts he had also received  from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, according to our <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Wherefore that which shall be born of you shall be called <em>the Holy One</em>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q>  and, <q>You shall call his name <em>Jesus</em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033669"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;1:21</a></span> Thus he actually had (although only an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit) some idea of the Lord's dispensation, rather than of any strange and heretofore imperfectly understood one. Because he also premised this question: <q>What have we to do with You?</q>&mdash; not as if referring to a strange Jesus, to whom pertain the <em><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em> spirits of the Creator. Nor did he say, What have You to do with us? But, <q>What have we to do with You?</q> as if deploring himself, and deprecating his own calamity; at the prospect of which he adds: <q>Have You come to destroy us?</q> So completely did he acknowledge in Jesus the Son of that God who was judicial and avenging, and (so to speak) severe,  and not of him who was simply good,  and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not how to destroy or how to punish! Now for what purpose have we adduced his passage first?  In order to show that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was neither acknowledged by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit, nor affirmed by Himself, to be any other than the Creator's. Well, but Jesus rebuked him, you say. To be sure he did, as being an <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> (spirit), and in his very confession only petulant, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in adulation&mdash; just as if it had been Christ's highest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to have come for the destruction of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and not for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; whereas His wish really was that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the subjection of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> but in the fair beauty of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  Why else  did He rebuke him? If it was because he was entirely wrong (in his invocation), then He was neither Jesus nor the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if it was because he was partially wrong&mdash; for having supposed him to be, rightly enough,  Jesus and the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also as belonging to the Creator&mdash; most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> would He have rebuked him for thinking what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he ought to think (about Him), and for not supposing that of Him which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that he ought to suppose&mdash; that he was another Jesus, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one of the other god. If, however, the rebuke has not a more probable meaning  than that which we ascribe to it, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit made no mistake, and was not rebuked for lying; for it was Jesus Himself, besides whom it was impossible for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit to have acknowledged any other, while Jesus affirmed that He was He whom the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit had acknowledged, by not rebuking him for uttering a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Other Proofs from the Same Chapter, that Jesus, Who Preached at Nazareth, and Was Acknowledged by Certain Demons as Christ the Son of God, Was the Creator's Christ. As Occasion Offers, the Docetic Errors of Marcion are Exposed.</h2>

<p>The Christ of the Creator had  to be called a <em>Nazarene</em> according to <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; whence the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also designate us, on that very account,  <em>Nazerenes</em>  after Him. For we are they of whom it is written, <q>Her Nazarites were whiter than snow;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033680"><a href="../bible/lam004.htm#verse7">Lamentations&nbsp;4:7</a></span> even they who were once defiled with the stains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and darkened with the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But to Christ the title Nazarene was destined to become a suitable one, from the hiding-place of His infancy, for which He went down and dwelt at <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>,  to escape from Archelaus the son of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. This fact I have not refrained from mentioning on this account, because it behooved <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ to have forborne all connection whatever with the <em>domestic</em> localities of the Creator's Christ, when he had so many towns in Jud&aelig;a which had not been by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> thus assigned  to the Creator's Christ. But Christ will be (the Christ) of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, wheresoever He is found in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And yet even at <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> He is not remarked as having preached anything new, <span class="stiki" id="note033683"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;4:23</a></span> while in another <em>verse</em> He is said to have been rejected <span class="stiki" id="note033684"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;4:29</a></span> by reason of a simple proverb. <span class="stiki" id="note033685"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;4:24</a></span> Here at once, when I observe that they laid their hands on Him, I cannot help drawing a conclusion respecting His bodily substance, which cannot be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been a phantom,  since it was capable of being touched and even violently handled, when He was seized and taken and led to the very brink of a precipice. For although He escaped through the midst of them, He had already experienced their rough treatment, and afterwards went His way, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>  because the crowd (as usually happens) gave way, or was even broken through; but not because it was eluded as by an impalpable disguise,  which, if there had been such, would not at all have submitted to any touch.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Tangere enim et tangi, nisi corpus, nulla potest res,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>is even a sentence worthy of a place in the world's wisdom. In short, He did himself touch others, upon whom He laid His hands, which were capable of being felt, and conferred the blessings of healing, <span class="stiki" id="note033690"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;4:40</a></span> which were not less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, not less unimaginary, than were the hands wherewith He bestowed them. He was therefore the very Christ of Isaiah, the healer of our sicknesses.  <q>Surely,</q> says he, <q>He has borne our griefs and <em>carried</em> our sorrows.</q> Now the Greeks are accustomed to use for <em>carry</em> a word which also signifies to <em>take away</em>. A general promise is enough for me in passing.  Whatever were the cures which Jesus effected, He is mine. We will come, however, to the kinds of cures. To liberate men, then, from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, is a cure of sickness. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits (just in the manner of our former example) used to go forth with a testimony, exclaiming, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033693"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;4:41</a></span> &mdash; of what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is clear enough from the case itself. But they were rebuked, and ordered not to speak; precisely because  Christ willed Himself to be proclaimed by <em>men</em>, not by unclean spirits, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; even that Christ alone to whom this was befitting, because He had sent beforehand men through whom He might become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and who were assuredly worthier preachers. It was natural to Him  to refuse the proclamation of an unclean spirit, at whose command there was an abundance of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He, however,  who had never been foretold (if, indeed, he wished to be acknowledged; for if he did not wish so much, his coming was in vain), would not have spurned the testimony of an alien or any sort of substance, who did not happen to have a substance of his own,  but had descended in an alien one. And now, too, as the destroyer also of the Creator, he would have desired nothing better than to be acknowledged by <em>His</em> spirits, and to be divulged for the sake of being feared:  only that <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> says  that his god is not feared; maintaining that a good being is not an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but only a judicial being, in whom reside the grounds  of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, severity, judgments, vengeance, condemnation. But it was from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, undoubtedly, that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> were cowed.  Therefore they confessed that (Christ) was the Son of a God who was to be feared, because they would have an occasion of not submitting if there were none for fearing. Besides, He showed that He was to be feared, because He drove them out, not by persuasion like a good being, but by command and reproof. Or else did he  reprove them, because they were making him an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, when all the while he did not want to be feared? And in what manner did he wish them to go forth, when they could not do so except with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? So that he fell into the dilemma  of having to conduct himself contrary to his nature, whereas he might in his simple goodness have at once treated them with leniency. He fell, too, into another false position &mdash; of prevarication, when he permitted himself to be feared by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> as the Son of the Creator, that he might drive them out, not indeed by his own power, but by the authority of the Creator. <q>He departed, and went into a desert place.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033705"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;4:42</a></span> This was, indeed, the Creator's customary region. It was proper that the Word  should there appear in body, where He had aforetime, wrought in a cloud. To the gospel also was suitable that condition of place  which had once been determined on for the law.  <q>Let the wilderness and the solitary place, therefore, be glad and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>;</q> so had Isaiah promised. <span class="stiki" id="note033709"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;35:1</a></span> When <q>stayed</q> by the crowds, He said, <q>I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033710"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;4:42-43</a></span> Had He displayed His God anywhere yet? I suppose as yet nowhere. But was He speaking of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of another god also? I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> so. If, therefore, neither He had preached, nor they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, any other God but the Creator, He was announcing the kingdom of that God whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be the only God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those who were listening to Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Out of St. Luke's Fifth Chapter are Found Proofs of Christ's Belonging to the Creator, E.g. In the Call of Fishermen to the Apostolic Office, and in the Cleansing of the Leper. Christ Compared with the Prophet Elisha.</h2>

<p>Out of so many kinds of occupations, why indeed had He such respect for that of fishermen, as to select from it for <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> Simon and the sons of Zebedee (for it cannot seem to be the mere fact itself for which the narrative was meant to be drawn out ), saying to Peter, when he trembled at the very large draught of the fishes, <q>Fear not; from henceforth you shall catch men?</q>  By saying this, He suggested to them the meaning of the fulfilled <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, that it was even He who by Jeremiah had foretold, <q>Behold, I will send many fishers; and they shall fish them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033713"><a href="../bible/jer016.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;16:16</a></span> that is, men. Then at last they left their boats, and followed Him, understanding that it was He who had begun to accomplish what He had declared. It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of shipmasters, intending one day to appoint the shipmaster <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> his apostle. We have indeed already laid it down, in opposition to his <em>Antitheses</em>, that the position of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> derives no advantage from the diversity which he supposes to exist between the Law and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, inasmuch as even this was ordained by the Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new Law, and the new Word, and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with special care,  as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in his domain,  a certain companion in misery (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03C0;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>), and associate in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>), with himself, for the cure of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note033716"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;5:12-14</a></span> I shall not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out to him the force of the law figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> (who was not to be touched, but was rather to be removed from all intercourse with others), prohibited any communication with a person who was defiled with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat food, <span class="stiki" id="note033717"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:11</a></span> forasmuch as the taint of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> would be communicated as if contagious, wherever a man should mix himself with the sinner. The Lord, therefore, wishing that the law should be more profoundly understood as signifying spiritual truths by carnal facts &mdash; and thus  not destroying,  but rather building up, that <em>law</em> which He wanted to have more earnestly acknowledged&mdash; touched the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, by whom (even although as man He might have been defiled) He could not be defiled as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being of course incorruptible. The prescription, therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He was bound to observe the law and not touch the unclean person, seeing that contact with the unclean would not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> defilement to Him. I thus teach that this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when I show that it is not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy  of the law that He touched the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>&mdash; disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the defilement&mdash; how could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body  which could be defiled? For a phantom is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could not be defiled, as being a phantom, will not have an immunity from pollution by any divine power, but owing to his fantastic vacuity; nor can he be regarded as having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material capacity  for it; nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped defilement from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. If, however, the Creator's <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian alone,  to the exclusion of  so many <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,  this fact contributes nothing to the distinction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as if he were in this way the better one for cleansing this Israelite <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, although a stranger to him, whom his own Lord had been unable to cleanse. The cleansing of the Syrian rather  was significant throughout the nations of the world  of their own cleansing in Christ their light,  steeped as they were in the stains of the seven deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>:  <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, fornication, false-<a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and fraud.  Seven times, therefore, as if once for each,  did he wash in Jordan; both in order that he might celebrate the expiation of a perfect hebdomad;  and because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and fullness of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was <em>thus</em> solemnly imputed  to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, alone, who was one day to establish on earth not only a revelation, but also a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, endued with compendious efficacy.  Even <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> finds here an antithesis:  how that Elisha indeed required a material resource, applied water, and that seven times; whereas Christ, by the employment of a word only, and that but once for all, instantly effected  the cure. And surely I might venture  to claim  the Very Word also as of the Creator's substance. There is nothing of which He who was the primitive Author is not also the more powerful one. Forsooth,  it is incredible that that power of the Creator should have, by a word, produced a remedy for a single malady, which once by a word brought into being so vast a fabric as the world! From what can the Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from the power of His word? But Christ is on this account another (Christ), because He acted differently from Elisha&mdash; because, <em>in fact</em>, the master is more powerful than his servant! Why, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, do you lay down the rule, that things are done by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on the ground that He was <em>once</em> more powerful than a servant of the Creator&mdash; since, in comparison with the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, if indeed greater!  For the cure is the same, although there is a difference in the working of it. What has your Christ performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what great thing has the word of your Christ performed, when it has <em>simply</em> done that which a river of the Creator effected? On the same principle occurs all the rest. So far as renouncing all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> went, He forbade the man to publish abroad <em>the cure</em>; but so far as the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the law was concerned, He requested that the usual course should be followed: <q>Go, show yourself to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and present the offering which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> commanded.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033741"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;5:14</a></span> For the figurative signs of the law in its types He still would have observed, because of their prophetic import.  These types signified that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, once a sinner, but afterwards purified  from the stains thereof by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was bound to offer unto God in the temple a gift, even <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and thanksgiving in the church through Christ Jesus, who is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Priest of the Father.  Accordingly He added: <q>that it may be for a testimony unto you</q>&mdash; one, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, whereby He would testify that He was not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that it was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake  their sicknesses and infirmities. This very consistent and becoming explanation of <q>the testimony,</q> that adulator of his own Christ, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> seeks to exclude under the cover of mercy and gentleness. For, being both good (such are his words), and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, besides, that every man who had been freed from <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> would be sure to perform the solemnities of the law, therefore He gave this precept. Well, what then? Has He continued in his goodness (that is to say, in his permission of the law) or not? For if he has persevered in his goodness, he will never become a destroyer of the law; nor will he ever be accounted as belonging to another god, because there would not exist that destruction of the law which would constitute his claim to belong to the other god. If, however, he has not continued good, by a subsequent destruction of the law, it is a false testimony which he has since imposed upon them in his cure of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>; because he has forsaken his goodness, in destroying the law. If, therefore, he was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> while upholding the law,  he has now become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as a destroyer of the law. However, by the support which he gave to the law, he affirmed that the law was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For no one permits himself in the support of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing. Therefore he is not only bad if he has permitted <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared  as the destroyer of a good law. So that if he commanded the offering of the gift because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that every cured <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> would be sure to bring one; he possibly abstained from commanding what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> would be spontaneously done. In vain, therefore, was his coming down, as if with the intention of destroying the law, when he makes concessions to the keepers of the law. And yet,  because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their disposition,  he ought the more earnestly to have prevented their neglect of the law,  since he had come for this purpose. Why then did he not keep silent, that man might of his own simple will <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the law? For then might he have seemed to some extent  to have persisted in his patience. But he adds also his own authority increased by the weight of this <q>testimony.</q> Of what testimony, I ask,  if not that of the assertion of the law? Surely it matters not in what way he asserted the law&mdash; whether as good, or as supererogatory,  or as patient, or as inconstant&mdash; provided, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, I drive you from your position.  Observe,  he commanded that the law should be fulfilled. In whatever way he commanded it, in the same way might he also have first uttered that sentiment:  <q>I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033757"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> What business, therefore, had you to erase out of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that which was quite consistent in it?  For you have confessed that, in his goodness, he did in act what you deny that he did in word.  We have therefore good <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He uttered the word, in the fact that He did the deed; and that you have rather expunged the Lord's word, than that our (<a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>)  have inserted it.</p>

For, says Isaiah, <q>they shall see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033762"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;35:2</a></span> What <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and what excellency? <q>Be strong, you weak hands, and you feeble knees:</q>  this refers to the palsy. <q>Be strong; <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033764"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;35:4</a></span> <em>Be strong</em> is not vainly repeated, nor is <em><a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not</em> vainly added; because with the renewal of the limbs there was to be, according to the promise, a restoration also of bodily energies: <q>Arise, and take up your couch;</q> and likewise moral <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>  not to be afraid of those who should say, <q>Who can forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but God alone?</q> So that you have here not only the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which promised a particular kind of healing, but also of the symptoms which followed the cure. In like manner, you should also recognise Christ in the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> as the forgiver of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <q>For,</q> he says, <q>He shall remit to many their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and shall Himself take away our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  For in an earlier passage, speaking in the person of the Lord himself, he had said: <q>Even though your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be as scarlet, I will make them as white as snow; even though they be like crimson, I will whiten them as wool.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033767"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;1:18</a></span> In the scarlet colour He indicates the blood of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; in the crimson, that of the Lord, as the brighter. Concerning the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, Micah also says: <q>Who is a God like You? pardoning iniquity, and passing by the transgressions of the remnant of Your heritage. He retains not His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> as a testimony <em>against them</em>, because He delights in mercy. He will turn again, and will have compassion upon us; He wipes away our iniquities, and casts our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> into the depths of the sea.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033768"><a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse18">Micah&nbsp;7:18-19</a></span> Now, if nothing of this sort had been predicted of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I should find in the Creator examples of such a benignity as would hold out to me the promise of similar affections also in the Son of whom He is the Father. I see how the Ninevites obtained forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the Creator <span class="stiki" id="note033769"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse10">Jonah&nbsp;3:10</a></span> &mdash; not to say from Christ, even then, because from the beginning He acted in the Father's name. I read, too, how that, when David acknowledged his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against Uriah, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Nathan said unto him, <q>The Lord has cancelled  your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and you shall not die;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033771"><a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:13</a></span> how king Ahab in like manner, the husband of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a>, guilty of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and of the blood of Naboth, obtained pardon because of his repentance; <span class="stiki" id="note033772"><a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;21:29</a></span> and how Jonathan the son of Saul blotted out by his deprecation the guilt of a violated fast.  Why should I recount the frequent restoration of the nation itself after the forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?&mdash; by that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indeed, who will have mercy rather than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and a sinner's repentance rather than his death. <span class="stiki" id="note033774"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:11</a></span> You will first have to deny that the Creator ever forgave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; then you must in reason show  that He never ordained any such prerogative for His Christ; and so you will prove how novel is that boasted  benevolence of the, of course, novel Christ when you shall have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it is neither compatible with  the Creator nor predicted by the Creator. But whether to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can appertain to one who is said to be unable to retain them, and whether to absolve can belong to him who is incompetent even to condemn, and whether to forgive is suitable to him against whom no offense can be committed, are questions which we have encountered elsewhere,  when we preferred to drop suggestions  rather than treat them anew.  Concerning the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> our rule  is a twofold one: that Christ cannot lie, so as to declare Himself the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, if He be not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> so; nor can He be constituted the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, unless He be born of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> parent, either father or mother. And then the discussion will turn on the point, of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> parent He ought to be accounted the son&mdash; of the father or the mother? Since He is (begotten) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is not, of course, (the son) of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father. If He is not of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father, it follows that He must be (the son) of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mother. If of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mother, it is evident that she must be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. For to whom a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father is not ascribed, to his mother a husband will not be reckoned; and then to what mother a husband is not reckoned, the condition of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> belongs.  But if His mother be not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, two fathers will have to be reckoned to Him&mdash; a divine and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> one. For she must have a husband, not to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; and by having a husband, she would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> two fathers&mdash; one divine, the other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>&mdash; to accrue to Him, who would thus be Son both of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Such a nativity (if one may call it so)  the mythic stories assign to Castor or to Hercules. Now, if this distinction be observed, that is to say, if He be <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> as born of His mother, because not begotten of a father, and His mother be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, because His father is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>&mdash; He will be that Christ whom Isaiah foretold that a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> should conceive, <span class="stiki" id="note033784"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> on what principle you, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, can admit Him <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, I cannot possibly see. If through a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father, then you deny him to be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; if through a divine one <em>also</em>,  then you make Christ the Hercules of fable; if through a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mother only, then you concede my point; if not through a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father <em>also</em>,  then He is not the son of any man,  and He must have been guilty of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> for having declared Himself to be what He was not. One thing alone can help you in your difficulty: boldness on your part either to surname your God as actually the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> did  with his <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>; or else to deny that the Virgin was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, which even <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> did not do. What now, if Christ be described  in Daniel by this very title of <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>?</q> Is not this enough to prove that He is the Christ of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>? For if He gives Himself that appellation which was provided in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> for the Christ of the Creator, He undoubtedly offers Himself to be understood as Him to whom (the appellation) was assigned by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. But perhaps  it can be regarded as a simple identity of names;  and yet we have maintained  that neither Christ nor Jesus ought to have been called by these names, if they possessed any condition of diversity. But as regards the appellation <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>,</q> in <em>as</em> far as it occurs by accident,  in <em>so</em> far there is a difficulty in its occurrence along with  a casual identity of names. For it is of pure  accident, especially when the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does not appear  whereby the identity may be occasioned. And therefore, if <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ be also said to be born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then he too would receive an identical appellation, and there would be two Sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as also two Christs and two Jesuses. Therefore, since the appellation is the sole right of Him in whom it has a suitable reason,  if it be claimed for another in whom there is an identity of name, but not of appellation,  then the identity of name even looks suspicious in him for whom is claimed without reason the identity of appellation. And it follows that He must be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be One and the Same, who is found to be the more fit to receive both the name and the appellation; while the other is excluded, who has no right to the appellation, because he has no reason to show for it. Nor will any other be better entitled to both than He who is the earlier, and has had allotted to Him the name of Christ and the appellation of <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, even the Jesus of the Creator. It was He who was seen by the king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> in the furnace with His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: <q>the fourth, who was like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033799"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse25">Daniel&nbsp;3:25</a></span> He also was revealed to Daniel himself expressly as <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, coming in the clouds of heaven</q> as a Judge, as also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> shows. <span class="stiki" id="note033800"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13</a></span> What I have advanced might have been sufficient concerning the designation in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> offers me further information, even in the interpretation of the Lord Himself. For when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who looked at Him as merely man, and were not yet sure that He was God also, as being likewise the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, rightly enough said that a man could not forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but God alone, why did He not, following up their point  about <em>man</em>, answer them, that He  had power to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; inasmuch as, when He mentioned the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, He also named a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being? Except it were because He wanted, by help of the very designation <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a></q> from the book of Daniel, so to induce them to reflect  as to show them that He who remitted <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash; that only <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, indeed, in the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Daniel, who had obtained the power of judging, and thereby, of course, of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> likewise (for He who judges also absolves); so that, when once that objection of theirs  was shattered to pieces by their recollection of Scripture, they might the more easily acknowledge Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> Himself by His own actual forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. I make one more observation,  how that He has nowhere as yet professed Himself to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; but for the first time in this passage, in which for the first time He has remitted <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; that is, in which for the first time He has used His function of <em>judgment</em>, by the absolution. All that the opposite side has to allege in argument against these things, (I beg you) carefully weigh  what it amounts to. For it must needs strain itself to such a pitch of infatuation as, on the one hand, to maintain that (their Christ) is also <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, in order to save Him from the charge of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; and, on the other hand, to deny that He was born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, lest they grant that He was the Virgin's son. Since, however, the divine authority and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case, and common sense, do not admit this insane position of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, we have here the opportunity of putting in a veto  in the briefest possible terms, <em>on the substance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body</em>, against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> phantoms. Since He is born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. He is body derived from body.  You may, I assure you,  more easily find a man born without a heart or without brains, like <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> himself, than without a body, like <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ. And let this be the limit to your examination of the heart, or, at any rate, the brains of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Call of Levi the Publican. Christ in Relation to the Baptist. Christ as the Bridegroom. The Parable of the Old Wine and the New. Arguments Connecting Christ with the Creator.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> who was chosen by the Lord,  he adduces for a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that he was chosen as a stranger to the law and uninitiated in  <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, by one who was an adversary to the law. The case of Peter escaped his memory, who, although he was a man of the law, was not only chosen by the Lord, but also obtained the testimony of possessing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which was given to him by the Father. <span class="stiki" id="note033813"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;16:17</a></span> He had nowhere read of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> being foretold as the light, and hope, and expectation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>! <em>He</em>, however, rather spoke of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in a favourable light, when he said, <q>The whole needed not a physician, but they that are sick.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033814"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;5:31</a></span> For since by <q>those that are sick</q> he meant that the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> should be understood, whom he was choosing, he affirmed of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that they were <q>whole</q> for whom he said that a physician was not necessary. This being the case, he makes a mistake in coming down  to destroy the law, as if for the remedy of a diseased condition. because they who were living under it were <q>whole,</q> and <q>not in want of a physician.</q> How, moreover, does it happen that he proposed the similitude of a <em>physician</em>, if he did not verify it? For, just as nobody uses a physician for healthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so will no one do so for strangers, in so far as he is one of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god-made men,  having to himself both a creator and preserver, and a specially good physician, in his Christ. This much the comparison predetermines, that a physician is more usually furnished by him to whom the sick people belong. Whence, too, does John come upon the scene? Christ, suddenly; and just as suddenly, John!  After this fashion occur all things in <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> system. They have their own special and plenary course  in the Creator's dispensation. Of John, however, what else I have to say will be found in another passage.  To the several points which now come before us an answer must be given. This, then, I will take care to do &mdash; demonstrate that, reciprocally, John is suitable to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and Christ to John, the latter, of course, as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the Creator, just as the former is the Creator's Christ; and so the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> may blush at frustrating, to his own frustration, the mission of John <em>the Baptist</em>. For if there had been no ministry of John at all&mdash; <q>the voice,</q> as Isaiah calls him, <q>of one crying in the wilderness,</q> and the preparer of the ways of the Lord by denunciation and recommendation of repentance; if, too, he had not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (Christ) Himself  along with others, nobody could have challenged the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as they ate and drank, to a comparison with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of John, who were constantly <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>; because, if there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> any diversity  between Christ and John, and their followers respectively, no exact comparison would be possible, nor would there be a single point where it could be challenged. For nobody would feel surprise, and nobody would be perplexed, although there should arise rival predictions of a diverse deity, which should also mutually differ about modes of conduct,  having a prior difference about the authorities  upon which they were based. Therefore Christ belonged to John, and John to Christ; while both belonged to the Creator, and both were of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, preachers and masters. Else Christ would have rejected the discipline of John, as of the rival god, and would also have defended the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as very properly pursuing a different walk, because <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the service of another and contrary deity. But as it is, while modestly  giving a reason why <q>the children of the bridegroom are unable to fast during the time the bridegroom is with them,</q> but promising that <q>they should afterwards fast, when the bridegroom was taken away from them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033826"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;5:34-35</a></span> He neither defended the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, (but rather excused them, as if they had not been blamed without some reason), nor rejected the discipline of John, but rather allowed  it, referring it to the time of John, although destining it for His own time. Otherwise His purpose would have been to reject it,  and to defend its opponents, if He had not Himself already belonged to it as then in force. I hold also that it is my Christ who is meant by the bridegroom, of whom the psalm says: <q>He is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return is back to the end of it again.</q>  By the mouth of Isaiah He also says exultingly of the Father: <q>Let my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord; for He has clothed me with the garment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and with the tunic of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, as a bridegroom. He has put a mitre round about my head, as a bride.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033830"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;61:10</a></span> To Himself likewise He appropriates  the church, concerning which the same  Spirit says to Him: <q>You shall clothe You with them all, as with a bridal ornament.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033833"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;49:18</a></span> This spouse Christ invites home to Himself also by Solomon from the call of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, because you read: <q>Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033834"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse8">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:8</a></span> He elegantly makes mention of Lebanon (the mountain, of course) because it stands for the name of frankincense with the Greeks;  for it was from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> that He <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> Himself the church. Deny now, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, your utter <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, (if you can)! Behold, you impugn even the law of your god. He unites not in the nuptial bond, nor, when contracted, does he allow it; no one does he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> but a <em>c&aelig;lebs</em> or a eunuch; until death or <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> does he reserve <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.  Wherefore, then, do you make his Christ a bridegroom? This is the designation of Him who united man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not of him who separated them. You have erred also in that declaration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, wherein He seems to make a difference between things new and old. You are inflated about the old bottles, and brain-muddled with the new wine; and therefore to the old (that is to say, to the prior) gospel you have sewed on the patch of your new-fangled <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what respect the Creator is inconsistent with Himself.  When by Jeremiah He gave this precept, <q>Break up for yourselves new pastures,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033838"><a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;4:3</a></span> does He not turn away from the old state of things? And when by Isaiah He proclaims how <q>old things were passed away; and, behold, all things, which I am making, are new,</q>  does He not advert to a new state of things? We have generally been of opinion  that the destination of the former state of things was rather promised by the Creator, and exhibited in reality by Christ, only under the authority of one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom appertain both the old things and the new. For new wine is not put into old bottles, except by one who has the old bottles; nor does anybody put a new piece to an old garment, unless the old garment be forthcoming to him. That person only  does not do a thing when it is not to be done, who has the materials wherewithal to do it if it were to be done. And therefore, since His object in making the comparison was to show that He was separating the new condition  of the gospel from the old state  of the law, He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that that  from which He was separating His own  ought not to have been branded  as a separation  of things which were alien to each other; for nobody ever unites his own things with things that are alien to them,  in order that he may afterwards be able to separate them from the alien things. A separation is possible by help of the conjunction through which it is made. Accordingly, the things which He separated He also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been once one; as they would have remained, were it not for His separation. But still we make this concession, that there is a separation, by reformation, by amplification,  by progress; just as the fruit is separated from the seed, although the fruit comes from the seed. So likewise the gospel is separated from the law, while it advances  from the law&mdash; a different thing  from it, but not an alien one; diverse, but not contrary. Nor in Christ do we even find any novel form of discourse. Whether He proposes similitudes  or refute questions, it comes from the seventy-seventh Psalm. <q>I will open,</q> says He, <q>my mouth in a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a></q> (that is, in a similitude); <q>I will utter <em>dark</em> problems</q> (that is, I will set forth questions).  If you should wish to prove that a man belonged to another race, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> you would fetch your <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the idiom of his language.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Christ's Authority Over the Sabbath. As Its Lord He Recalled It from Pharisaic Neglect to the Original Purpose of Its Institution by the Creator the Case of the Disciples Who Plucked the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath. The Withered Hand Healed on the Sabbath.</h2>

<p>Concerning the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> also I have this to premise, that this question could not have arisen, if Christ did not publicly proclaim  the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling  the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, if He had a right  to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests on some novel institution  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let this stand as a settled point, that discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because as nothing was as yet advanced <em>by Christ</em> touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because it had been foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new  god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> I thus rule. If Christ interfered with  the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, He simply acted after the Creator's example; inasmuch as in the siege of the city of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> the carrying around the walls of the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, actually  annulled the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, by the Creator's command&mdash; according to the opinion of those who think this of Christ <em>in this passage of St. Luke</em>, in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, as we shall by and by show. And yet the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was actually then broken  by Joshua,  so that the present charge might be alleged also against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But even if, as being not the Christ of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, He displayed a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> most solemn day, He was only professedly following  the Creator, as being His Christ, in this very <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: <q>Your new moons and your <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033863"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;1:14</a></span> Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had been hungry; on that <em>the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a></em> day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> bring the charge against Him. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in <em>Christ's</em> purpose.  For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there is derived a colourable precedent &mdash; as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and provided food by boldly breaking up the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a>.  Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>) was allowed to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> from the very beginning, when the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> the feast of the following <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,  when He bestowed the privilege of not <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. In short, He would have then and there  put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to fast on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, contrary to the intention  of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> and of the Creator's will. But because He did not directly defend  His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but excuses them; because He interposes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;  because he puts David and his companions on a level with His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in their fault and their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse  the Creator's indulgence:  because He is Himself good according to <em>His</em> example&mdash; is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> watch whether He would heal on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note033874"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;6:7</a></span> that they might accuse Him&mdash; surely as a violator of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ  is nowhere proclaimed. The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, however, were in utter <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning the law of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, <q>In it you shall not do any work of yours,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033876"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse16">Exodus&nbsp;20:16</a></span> by the word <em>yours</em>  it restricts the prohibition to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> work&mdash; which every one performs in his own employment or business&mdash; and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So again, in the law it says, <q>You shall not do any manner of work in it,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033878"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse16">Exodus&nbsp;12:16</a></span> except what is to be done for any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  that is to say, in the matter of delivering the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;  because what is God's work may be done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> agency for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. By <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.  Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, <q>Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? To save life, or to destroy it?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033882"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;6:9</a></span> In order that He might, while allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  remind them what works the law of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> forbade&mdash; even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> works; and what it enjoined&mdash; even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  He was called <q>Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033885"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;6:5</a></span> because He maintained  the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, He would have had the right to do so,  as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was not broken  by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. For that was really  God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, by calling them <em>your <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a></em>, <span class="stiki" id="note033890"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;1:13-14</a></span> reckoning them as men's <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, not His own, because they were celebrated without the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God <q>with the lip, not the heart,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033891"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> He has yet put His own <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in a later passage,  He declared them to be <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and delightful, and inviolable.</q> Thus Christ did not at all rescind the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, <q>I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033893"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> although <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> has gagged  His mouth by this word.  For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; <em>moreover</em>, He exhibits in a clear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>  <em>and</em> while imparting to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> itself, which from the beginning had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the benediction of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, an additional <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards, &mdash; a course which  His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and restoring to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> the works which were proper for it. Since, in like manner, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,  you see, O <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, and you too, O <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, how that it was <em>proper employment</em> for the Creator's <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> of old  to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how that Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example,  the gentleness, the mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very example He fulfils  the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: <q>The weak hands are strengthened,</q> as were also <q>the feeble knees</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033903"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;35:3</a></span> in the sick of the palsy.</p>

Many Quotations Out of the Old Testament Prophetically Bear on Certain Events of the Life of Jesus&mdash; Such as His Ascent to Praying on the Mountain; His Selection of Twelve Apostles; His Changing Simon's Name to Peter, and Gentiles from Tyre and Sidon Resorting to Him.</h2>

<p>Surely to Sion He brings good tidings, and to Jerusalem peace and all blessings; He goes up into a mountain, and there spends a night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note033904"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;6:12</a></span> and He is indeed heard by the Father.

But why was it that He chose <em>twelve</em> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note033914"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;6:13-19</a></span> and not some other number? In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  I might from this very point conclude  of my Christ, that He was foretold not only by the words of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but by the indications of facts. For of this number I find figurative hints up and down the Creator's dispensation  in the twelve springs of Elim; <span class="stiki" id="note033918"><a href="../bible/num033.htm#verse9">Numbers&nbsp;33:9</a></span> in the twelve gems of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vestment; <span class="stiki" id="note033919"><a href="../bible/exo028.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;28:13-21</a></span> and in the twelve stones appointed by Joshua to be taken out of the Jordan, and set up for the ark of the covenant. Now, the same number of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> was thus portended, as if they were to be fountains and rivers which should water the Gentile world, which was formerly dry and destitute of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (as He says by Isaiah: <q>I will put streams in the unwatered ground</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033920"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;43:20</a></span>); as if they were to be gems to shed lustre upon the church's sacred robe, which Christ, the High Priest of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, puts on; as if, also, they were to be stones massive in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Joshua took out of the laver of the Jordan, and placed in the sanctuary of His covenant. What equally good defence of such a number has <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ to show? It is impossible that anything can be shown to have been done by him unconnectedly,  which cannot be shown to have been done by my Christ in connection (with preceding types).  To him will appertain the event  in whom is discovered the preparation for the same.  Again, He changes the name of Simon to Peter,  inasmuch as the Creator also altered the names of Abram, and Sarai, and Oshea, by calling the latter Joshua, and adding a syllable to each of the former. But why <em>Peter</em>? If it was because of the vigour of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, there were many solid materials which might lend a name from their strength. Was it because Christ was both a rock and a stone? For we read of His being placed <q>for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense.</q>  I omit the rest of the passage.  Therefore He would fain  impart to the dearest of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> a name which was suggested by one of His own special designations in figure; because it was, I suppose, more peculiarly fit than a name which might have been derived from no figurative description of Himself.  There come to Him from <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and from other districts even, a transmarine multitude. This fact the psalm had in view: <q>And behold tribes of foreign people, and <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and the people of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>; they were there. Sion is my mother, shall a man say; and in her was born a man</q> (forasmuch as the God-man was born), and He built her by the Father's will; that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> then flocked to Him, because He was born the God-man who was to build the church according to the Father's will&mdash; even of other races also.  So says Isaiah too: <q>Behold, these come from far; and these from the north and from the west;  and these from the land of the Persians.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033932"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;49:12</a></span> Concerning whom He says again: <q>Lift up your eyes round about, and behold, all these have gathered themselves together.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033933"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;49:18</a></span> And yet again: <q>You see these unknown and strange ones; and you will say in your heart, Who has begotten me these?

<h2>Chapter 14. Christ's Sermon on the Mount. In Manner and Contents It So Resembles the Creator's Dispensational Words and Deeds. It Suggests Therefore the Conclusion that Jesus is the Creator's Christ. The Beatitudes.</h2>

<p>I now come to those ordinary precepts of His, by means of which He adapts the peculiarity  of His doctrine to what I may call His official proclamation as the Christ.  <q>Blessed are the needy</q> (for no less than this is required for interpreting the word in the Greek,  <q>because theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033938"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;6:20</a></span> Now this very fact, that He begins with beatitudes, is characteristic of the Creator, who used no other voice than that of blessing either in the first fiat or the final dedication of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: for <q>my heart,</q> says He, <q>has indited a very good word.</q>  This will be that <q>very good word</q> of blessing which is admitted to be the initiating principle of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, after the example of the Old. What is there, then, to wonder at, if He entered <em>on His ministry</em> with the very attributes  of the Creator, who ever in language of the same sort loved, consoled, protected, <em>and</em> avenged the beggar, and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and the orphan? So that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this private bounty as it were of Christ to be a rivulet streaming from the springs of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Indeed, I hardly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which way to turn amidst so vast a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of <em>good</em> words like these; as if I were in a forest, or a meadow, or an orchard of apples. I must therefore look out for such matter as chance may present to me. </p>

<p>In the psalm he exclaims: <q>Defend the fatherless and the needy; do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and the poor; deliver the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and rid the needy out of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q>  Similarly in the seventy-first Psalm: <q>In righteousness shall He judge the needy among the people, and shall save the children of the poor.</q>  And in the following words he says of Christ: <q>All nations shall serve Him.</q>  Now David only reigned over the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, so that nobody can suppose that this was spoken of David; whereas <em>He</em> had taken upon Himself the condition of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and such as were oppressed with want, <q>Because He should deliver the needy out of the hand of the mighty man; He shall spare the needy and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and shall deliver the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the poor. From <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> shall He redeem their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and in His sight shall their name be honoured.</q>  Again: <q>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be turned into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, even all the nations that forget <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because the needy shall not always be forgotten; the endurance of the poor shall not perish for ever.</q>  Again: <q>Who is like the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who dwells on high, and yet looks on the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> things that are in heaven and on earth!&mdash; who raises up the needy from off the ground, and out of the dunghill exalts the poor; that He may set him with the princes of His people,</q>  that is, in His own kingdom. And likewise earlier, in the book of Kings,  Hannah the mother of Samuel gives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in these words: <q>He raises the poor man from the ground, and the beggar, that He may set him among the princes of His people (that is, in His own kingdom), and on thrones of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> (even royal ones). <span class="stiki" id="note033949"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:8</a></span> And by Isaiah how He inveighs against the oppressors of the needy! <q>What do you mean that you set fire to my vineyard, and that the spoil of the poor is in your houses?

For even if you suppose that the promises of the Creator were earthly, but that Christ's are heavenly, it is quite clear that heaven has been as yet the property of no other God whatever, than Him who owns the earth also; quite clear that the Creator has given even the lesser promises (of earthly blessing), in order that I may more readily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him concerning His greater promises (of heavenly blessings) also, than (<a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god), who has never given <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his liberality by any preceding bestowal of minor blessings. <q>Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033956"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;6:21</a></span> I might connect this clause with the former one, because none but the poor and needy suffer hunger, if the Creator had not specially designed that the promise of a similar blessing should serve as a preparation for the gospel, that so men might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it to be His.  For thus does He say, by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, concerning those whom He was about to call from the ends of the earth&mdash; that is, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: <q>Behold, they shall come swiftly with speed:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033958"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse26">Isaiah&nbsp;5:26</a></span> <em>swiftly</em>, because hastening towards the fullness of the times; <em>with speed</em>, because unclogged by the weights of the ancient law. They shall neither hunger nor thirst. Therefore <em>they shall be filled</em>,&mdash; a promise which is made to none but those who hunger and thirst. And again He says: <q>Behold, my servants shall be filled, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033959"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;65:13</a></span> As for these oppositions, we shall see whether they are not premonitors of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  Meanwhile the promise of fullness to the hungry is a provision of God the Creator. <q>Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033961"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;6:21</a></span> Turn again to the passage of Isaiah: <q>Behold, my servants shall exult with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but you shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall be glad, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033962"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;65:13-14</a></span> And recognise these oppositions also in the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Surely <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and joyous exultation is promised to those who are in an opposite condition&mdash; to the sorrowful, and sad, and anxious. Just as it is said in the 125th Psalm: <q>They who sow in tears shall reap in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q>  Moreover, laughter is as much an accessory to the exulting and glad, as weeping is to the sorrowful and grieving. Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, was the first who said that those who mourned should laugh. Accordingly, He who began (His course) with consolation for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at once eager  to represent Himself as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of Isaiah: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033965"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> <q>Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033966"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;6:20</a></span> <q>He has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033967"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> <q>Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033968"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;6:21</a></span> <q>To comfort all that mourn.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033969"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;61:2</a></span> <q>Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033970"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;6:21</a></span> <q>To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>) for ashes, and the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033971"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;61:3</a></span> Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course,  fulfilled such a ministration as this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own coming to do all this; or else if he is not yet come who predicted this, the charge to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ must be a ridiculous one (although I should perhaps add a necessary  one), which bade him say, <q>Blessed shall you be, when men shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man's</a> sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033974"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;6:22</a></span> In this declaration there is, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, an exhortation to patience. Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? <q>Fear not the reproach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor be diminished by their contempt.</q>  What reproach? What contempt? That which was to be incurred for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. What <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>? He who (has come) according to the Creator's will. Whence shall we get our <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>? From the very cutting off, which was predicted against Him; as when He says by Isaiah to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who were the instigators of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against Him: <q>Because of you, my name is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033976"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;52:5</a></span> and in another passage: <q>Lay the penalty on  Him who surrenders  His own life, who is held in contempt by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, whether servants or magistrates.</q>  Now, since <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> was predicted against that <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> who has His mission from the Creator, while the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> testifies that the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as derived from Christ, was to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man's</a> sake, because He is Christ, it determines the point that that was the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> in the matter of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> who came according to the Creator's purpose, and against whom the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> was predicted. And even if He had not yet come, the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of His name which exists at the present day could not in any case have possibly preceded Him who was to bear the name.  But He has both suffered the penalty  in our presence, and surrendered His life, laying it down for our sakes, and is held in contempt by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And He who was born (into the world) will be that very <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> on whose account our name also is rejected.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Sermon on the Mount Continued. Its Woes in Strict Agreement with the Creator's Disposition. Many Quotations Out of the Old Testament in Proof of This.</h2>

<p><q>In the like manner,</q> says He, <span class="stiki" id="note033982"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;6:26</a></span> <q>did their fathers unto the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> What a turncoat  is <em><a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a></em> Christ! Now the destroyer, now the advocate of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>! He destroyed them as their rival, by converting their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; he took up their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as their friend, by stigmatizing  their persecutors. But,  in <em>as</em> far as the defence of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> could not be consistent in the Christ of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, who came to destroy them; in <em>so</em> far is it becoming to the Creator's Christ that He should stigmatize those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for He in all things accomplished their predictions. Again, it is more characteristic of the Creator to upbraid sons with their fathers' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, than it is of that god who chastizes no man for even his own misdeeds. But you will say, He cannot be regarded as defending the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> simply because He wished to affirm the iniquity of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for their impious dealings with their own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Well, then, in this case,  no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ought to have been charged against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: they were rather deserving of praise and approbation when they maltreated  those whom the absolutely good god <em>of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a></em>, after so long a time, bestirred himself  to destroy. I suppose, however, that by this time he had ceased to be the absolutely good god;  he had now sojourned a considerable while even with the Creator, and was no longer (like) the god of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>  purely and simply. For see how he condescends  to curse, and proves himself capable of taking offense and feeling <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>! He actually pronounces a <em>woe</em>! But a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is raised against us as to the import of this word, as if it carried with it less the sense of a curse than of an admonition. Where, however, is the difference, since even an admonition is not given without the sting of a threat, especially when it is embittered with a <em>woe</em>? Moreover, both admonition and threatening will be the resources of him  who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to feel <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. For no one will forbid the doing of a thing with an admonition or a threat, except him who will inflict punishment for the doing of it. No one would inflict punishment, except him who was susceptible of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Others, again, admit that the word implies a curse; but they will have it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as if it were His own genuine feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted to set forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the more commend His own long-suffering  in His beatitudes. Just as if it were not competent to the Creator, in the pre-eminence of both His attributes as the good God and Judge, that, as He had made clemency  the preamble of His benediction so He should place severity in the sequel of His curses; thus fully developing His discipline in both directions, both in following out the blessing and in providing against the curse.  He had already said of old, <q>Behold, I have set before you blessing and cursing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note033996"><a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy&nbsp;30:19</a></span> Which statement was really a presage of  this temper of the gospel. Besides, what sort of being is that who, to insinuate a belief in his own goodness, invidiously contrasted  with it the Creator's severity? Of little worth is the recommendation which has for its prop the defamation of another. And yet by thus setting forth the severity of the Creator, he, in fact, affirmed Him to be an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.  Now if He be an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, He is of course more worthy of being <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> than slighted; and thus <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ begins to teach favourably to the Creator's interests.  Then, <em>on the admission above mentioned</em>, since the woe which has regard to the rich is the Creator's, it follows that it is not Christ, but the Creator, who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the rich; while Christ approves of  the incentives of the rich &mdash; I mean, their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, their pomp,  their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world, and their contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, owing to which they deserve the woe of the Creator. But how happens it that the reprobation of the rich does not proceed from the same <em>God</em> who had just before expressed approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the opposite of that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the Creator the woe pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for Him also the promise of the blessing upon the poor; and thus the entire work of the Creator devolves on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.&mdash; If to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god there be ascribed the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, he must also have imputed to him the malediction of the rich; and thus will he become the Creator's equal,  both good and judicial; nor will there be left any room for that distinction whereby two gods are made; and when this distinction is removed, there will remain the verity which pronounces the Creator to be the one only God. Since, therefore, <q> <em>woe</em></q> is a word indicative of malediction, or of some unusually austere  exclamation; and since it is by Christ uttered against the rich, I shall have to show that the Creator is also a despiser  of the rich, as I have shown Him to be the defender  of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, in order that I may prove Christ to be on the Creator's side in this matter, even when He enriched Solomon. <span class="stiki" id="note034008"><a href="../bible/1ki003.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;3:5-13</a></span> But <em>with respect to this man</em>, since, when a choice was left to him, he preferred asking for what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be well-pleasing to God&mdash; even wisdom&mdash; he further merited the attainment of the riches, which he did not prefer. The endowing of a man indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for by the help of riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; moreover, by them many a work of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and charity is carried out. But yet there are serious faults  which accompany riches; and it is because of these that woes are denounced on the rich, even in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>You have received,</q> says He, <q>your consolation;</q>  that is, of course, from their riches, in the pomps and vanities of the world which these purchase for them.

<p><q>But I say unto you which hear</q> (displaying here that old injunction, of the Creator: <q>Speak to the ears of those who lend them to you</q> ), <q>Love your enemies, and bless  those which <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them which <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> you.</q>  These commands the Creator included in one precept by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah: <q>Say, You are our brethren, to those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034038"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;66:5</a></span> For if they who are our enemies, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, and speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of us, and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> us, are to be called our brethren, surely He did in effect bid us bless them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them who <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> us, when He instructed us to reckon them as brethren. Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,  when He actually prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring <q>an eye for an eye,  and a tooth for a tooth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034041"><a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse24">Exodus&nbsp;21:24</a></span> and bids us, on the contrary, <q>to him who smites us on the one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that takes away our cloak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034042"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;6:29</a></span> No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator. And therefore this question must at once be determined,  Whether the discipline of patience be enjoined by  the Creator? When by Zechariah He commanded, <q>Let none of you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against his <em>brother</em>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034045"><a href="../bible/zec007.htm#verse10">Zechariah&nbsp;7:10</a></span> He did not expressly include his <em>neighbour</em>; but then in another passage He says, <q>Let none of you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your hearts against his <em>neighbour</em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034046"><a href="../bible/zec008.htm#verse17">Zechariah&nbsp;8:17</a></span> He who counselled that an injury should be forgotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it. But then, when He said, <q>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,</q>  He thereby teaches that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch as it is incredible  that the same (God) should seem to require <q>a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,</q> in return for an injury, who forbids not only all reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury, in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required <q>an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,</q>&mdash; not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition of the injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation or reciprocity;  so that every man, in view of the permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how much more easy it is to repress <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> by the prospect of retaliation, than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was necessary to provide, in consideration of the nature and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that the man who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in God might expect vengeance from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while he who had no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (to restrain him) might <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which prescribed retaliation.  This purpose  of the law, which it was difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and of the law, and of all the dispensations of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, both revealed and made intelligible,  when He commanded that <q>the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),</q> in order that He might the more effectually extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation  had manifestly restricted, both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus, whatever (new provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law, but rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription  of the Creator. If, therefore,  one looks carefully  into the very grounds for which patience is enjoined (and <em>that</em> to such a full and complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the case). If it were not so, &mdash; if so vast a weight of patience&mdash; which is to refrain from giving blow for blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, is to give up the cloak also&mdash; is laid upon me by one who means not to help me&mdash;(then all I can say is,) he has taught me patience to no purpose,  because he shows me no reward to his precept&mdash; I mean no fruit of such patience. There is revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he should himself have inflicted it;  since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury should be avenged. For by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed to it without discrimination,  it will get the mastery&mdash; it will put out (a man's) both eyes; it will knock out  every tooth in the safety of its impunity. This, however, is (the principle) of your good and simply beneficent god&mdash; to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, to leave the righteous undefended, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> unrestrained! <q>Give to every one that asks of you</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034062"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;6:30</a></span> &mdash; to the indigent of course, or rather to the indigent more especially, although to the affluent likewise. But in order that no man may be indigent, you have in Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the creditor.  <q>There shall not be in your hand an indigent man; so that the Lord your God shall bless you with blessings,</q> &mdash; <em>you</em> meaning the creditor to whom it was owing that the man was not indigent. But more than this. To one who does not ask, He bids a gift to be given. <q>Let there be, not,</q> He says, <q>a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man in your hand;</q> in other words, see that there be not, so far as your will can prevent;  by which command, too, He all the more strongly by inference requires  men to give to him that asks, as in the following words also: <q>If there be among you a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man of your brethren, you shall not turn away your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother. But you shall open your hand wide unto him, and shall surely lend him as much as he wants.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034067"><a href="../bible/deu015.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy&nbsp;15:7-8</a></span> Loans are not usually given, except to such as ask for them. On this subject of lending,  however, more hereafter.  Now, should any one wish to argue that the Creator's precepts extended only to a man's brethren, but Christ's to all that ask, so as to make the latter a new and different precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can be made out of those principles, which show the law of the Creator to be repeated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  For that is not a different thing which Christ enjoined to be done towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, from that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a man's brethren. For although that is a greater charity, which is shown to strangers, it is yet not preferable to that  which was previously due to one's neighbours. For what man will be able to bestow the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (which proceeds from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of character,  upon strangers? Since, however, the second step  in charity is towards strangers, while the first is towards one's neighbours, the second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more fitly than the second will belong to him who owned no first.  Accordingly, the Creator, when following the course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to <em>neighbours</em>,  intending afterwards to enjoin it towards <em>strangers</em>; and when following the method of His dispensation, He limited charity first to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but afterwards extended it to the whole race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. So long, therefore, as the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> <em>of His government</em>  was confined to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, He properly commanded that pity should be shown only to a man's brethren; but when Christ had given to Him <q>the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for His heritage, and the ends of the earth for His possession,</q> then began to be accomplished what was said by Hosea: <q>You are not my people, who were my people; you have not obtained mercy, who once obtained mercy</q> &mdash; that is, the (Jewish) nation. Thenceforth Christ extended to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the law of His Father's compassion, excepting none from His mercy, as He omitted none in His invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler scope of His teaching, He received it all in His heritage of the nations. <q>And as you would that men should do to you, do also to them likewise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034078"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;6:31</a></span> In this command is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> implied its counterpart: <q>And as you would <em>not</em> that men should do to you, so should you also <em>not</em> do to them likewise.</q> Now, if this were the teaching of the new and previously unknown and not yet fully proclaimed deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand, whereby I might first learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to do to others what I would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I should be unwilling to have done to myself, it would certainly be nothing else than the chance-medley of my own sentiments  which he would have left to me, binding me to no proper rule of wish or action, in order that I might do to others what I would like for myself, or refrain from doing to others what I should dislike to have done to myself. For he has not, in fact, defined what I ought to wish or not to wish for myself as well as for others, so that I shape my conduct  according to the law of my own will, and have it in my power  not to render  to another what I would like to have rendered to myself&mdash; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, consolation, protection, and such like blessings; and in like manner to do to another what I should be unwilling to have done to myself&mdash; <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, wrong, insult, deceit, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of like sort. Indeed, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who have not been instructed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> act on this incongruous liberty of the will and the conduct.  For although good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are severally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by nature, yet life is not thereby spent  under the discipline of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which alone at last teaches men the proper liberty of their will and action in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The god of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, therefore, although specially revealed, was, in spite of his revelation, unable to publish any summary of the precept in question, which had hitherto been so confined,  and obscure, and dark, and admitting of no ready interpretation, except according to my own arbitrary thought,  because he had provided no previous discrimination in the matter of such a precept. This, however, was not the case with my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for  He always and everywhere enjoined that the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the orphan, and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> should be protected, assisted, refreshed; thus by Isaiah He says: <q>Deal your bread to the hungry, and them that are houseless bring into your house; when you see the naked, cover him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034088"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;58:7</a></span> By Ezekiel also He thus describes the just man: <q>His bread will he give to the hungry, and the naked will he cover with a garment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034089"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse7">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:7</a></span> That teaching was even then a sufficient inducement to me to do to others what I would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He uttered such denunciations as, <q>You shall do no <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; you shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; you shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>; you shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034090"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;20:13-16</a></span> &mdash; He taught me to refrain from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and therefore the precept developed in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> will belong to Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to its importance,  to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another passage) the Lord&mdash; that is, Christ&mdash; <q>was to make (or utter) a concise word on earth.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Concerning Loans. Prohibition of Usury and the Usurious Spirit. The Law Preparatory to the Gospel in Its Provisions; So in the Present Instance. On Reprisals. Christ's Teaching Throughout Proves Him to Be Sent by the Creator.</h2>

<p>And now, on the subject of a loan, when He asks, <q>And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thank do you have?</q>  compare with this the following words of Ezekiel, in which He says of the before-mentioned just man, <q>He has not given his money upon <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, nor will he take any increase</q> &mdash; meaning the redundance of interest,  which is <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>. The first step was to eradicate the fruit of the money lent,  the more easily to accustom a man to the loss, should it happen, of the money <em>itself</em>, the interest of which he had learned to lose. Now this, we affirm, was the function of the law as preparatory to the gospel. It was engaged in forming the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of such as would learn,  by gradual stages, for the perfect light of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> discipline, through the best precepts of which it was capable,  inculcating a benevolence which as yet expressed itself but falteringly.  For <em>in the passage of Ezekiel</em> quoted above He says, <q>And you shall restore the pledge of the loan</q> &mdash; to him, certainly, who is incapable of repayment, because, as a matter of course, He would not anyhow prescribe the restoration of a pledge to one who was solvent. Much more clearly is it enjoined in Deuteronomy: <q>You shall not sleep upon his pledge; you shall be sure to return to him his garment about sunset, and he shall sleep in his own garment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034101"><a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;24:12-13</a></span> Clearer still is a former passage: <q>You shall remit every debt which your neighbour owes you; and of your brother you shall not require it, because it is called the release of the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034102"><a href="../bible/deu015.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy&nbsp;15:2</a></span> Now, when He commands that a debt be remitted to a man who shall be unable to pay it (for it is a still stronger argument when He forbids its being asked for from a man who is even able to repay it), what else does He teach than that we should lend to those of whom we cannot receive again, inasmuch as He has imposed so great a loss on lending? <q>And you shall be the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  What can be more shameless, than for him to be making us his <em>children</em>, who has not permitted us to make children for ourselves by forbidding marriage?  How does he propose to invest his followers with a name which he has already erased? I cannot be the son of a eunuch especially when I have for my Father the same great Being whom the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> claims for its! For is not the Founder of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as much a Father, even of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as (<a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a>) castrated deity,  who is the maker of no existing thing? Even if the Creator had not united male and female, and if He had not allowed any living creature whatever to have children, I yet had this relation to Him  before Paradise, before the fall, before the expulsion, before the two became one.  I became His son a second time,  as soon as He fashioned me  with His hands, and gave me motion with His inbreathing. Now again He names me His son, not begetting me into natural life, but into spiritual life.  <q>Because,</q> says He, <q>He is kind unto the unthankful and to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034111"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;6:35</a></span> Well done,  <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>! How cleverly have you withdrawn from Him the showers and the sunshine, that He might not seem to be a Creator! But who is this kind being  which hitherto has not been even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? How can he be kind who had previously shown no evidences of such a kindness as this, which consists of the loan to us of sunshine and rain?&mdash; who is not destined to receive from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> (the homage due to that) Creator,&mdash; who, up to this very moment, in return for His vast liberality in the gift of the elements, bears with men while they offer to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, more readily than Himself, the due returns of His graciousness. <em>But God</em> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> kind even in spiritual blessings. <q>The utterances  of the Lord are sweeter than honey and honeycombs.</q>  He then has taunted  men as ungrateful who deserved to have their gratitude&mdash; even He, whose sunshine and rain even you, O <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, have enjoyed, but without gratitude! Your god, however, had no right to complain of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> ingratitude, because he had used no means to make them grateful. Compassion also does He teach: <q>Be merciful,</q> says He, <q>as your Father also that had mercy upon you.</q>  This injunction will be of a piece with, <q>Deal your bread to the hungry; and if he be houseless, bring him into your house; and if you see the naked, cover him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034118"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;58:7</a></span> also with, <q>Judge the fatherless, plead with the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034119"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;1:17</a></span> I recognise here that ancient doctrine of Him who <q>prefers mercy to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034120"><a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse6">Hosea&nbsp;6:6</a></span> If, however, it be now some other being which teaches mercy, on the ground of his own mercifulness, how happens it that he has been wanting in mercy to me for so vast an age? <q>Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned; forgive, and you shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you: good measure, pressed down, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.

Let the Marcionites therefore make their choice: Will it not be just the same inconsistency to desert the prescription of their master, as to have Christ teaching in the interest of men or of the Creator?

For in applying to these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the figurative words which Christ used of men in general, we shall make a much more suitable interpretation of them than if we were to deduce out of them two gods, according to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> grievous exposition.  I think that I have the best reason possible for insisting still upon the position which I have all along occupied, that in no passage to be anywhere found has another God been revealed by Christ. I wonder that in this place alone <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> hands should have felt benumbed in their adulterating labour.  But even <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> have their qualms now and then. There is no wrong-doing without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, because there is none without a guilty <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. So long, then, were the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cognisant of no other god but Him, beside whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> none else; nor did they call upon any other than Him whom alone they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>.

The fact is, that He who was then imputing to them their ancient obstinacy was none other than He who, before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, had addressed to them these words, <q>This people honours me with their lips, but their heart stands far off from me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034136"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> Otherwise, how absurd it were that a new god, a new Christ, the revealer of a new and so grand a religion should denounce as obstinate and disobedient those whom he had never had it in his power to make trial of!</p>

<p>Likewise, when extolling the centurion's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, how incredible a thing it is, that <em>He</em> should confess that He had <q>found so great a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not even in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034137"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;7:1-10</a></span> to whom <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was in no way interesting!  But not from the fact (here stated by Christ)  could it have been of any interest to Him to approve and compare what was hitherto crude, nay, I might say, hitherto naught. Why, however, might He not have used the example of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in another  god? Because, if He had done so, He would have said that no such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had ever had <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; but as the case stands,  He intimates that He ought to have found so great a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, inasmuch as He had indeed come for the purpose of finding it, being in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the God and Christ of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and had now stigmatized  it, only as one who would enforce and uphold it. If, indeed, He had been its antagonist,  He would have preferred finding it to be such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  having come to weaken and destroy it rather than to approve of it. He raised also the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son from death. <span class="stiki" id="note034145"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;7:11-17</a></span> This was not a strange <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.  The Creator's <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had wrought such; then why not His Son much rather? Now, so evidently had the Lord Christ introduced no other god for the working of so momentous a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> as this, that all who were present gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Creator, saying: <q>A great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is risen up among us, and God has visited His people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034147"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;7:16</a></span> What God? He, of course, whose people they were, and from whom had come their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But if they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the Creator, and Christ (on hearing them, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> their meaning) refrained from correcting them even in their very act of invoking  the Creator in that vast manifestation <em>of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></em> in this raising of the dead, undoubtedly He either announced no other God but Him, whom He thus permitted to be honoured in His own beneficent acts and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, or else how happens it that He quietly permitted these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to remain so long in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, especially as He came for the very purpose to cure them of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? But John is offended  when he hears of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as of an alien god.  Well, I on my side  will first explain the reason of his offense, that I may the more easily explode the scandal  of our <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,  was operating and preaching on earth, it was necessary that the portion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which, in the form of the prophetic gift,  had been through John preparing the ways of the Lord, should now depart from John,  and return back again of course to the Lord, as to its all-embracing original.  Therefore John, being now an ordinary person, and only one of the many,  was offended indeed as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but not because he expected or thought of another Christ as teaching or doing nothing new, for he was not even expecting such a one.  Nobody will entertain doubts about any one whom (since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> him not to exist) he has no expectation or thought of. Now John was quite sure that there was no other God but the Creator, even as a Jew, especially as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.  Whatever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he felt was evidently rather  entertained about Him  whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> indeed to exist but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not whether He were the very <em>Christ</em>. With this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, therefore, even John asks the question, <q>Are you He that should come, or look we for another?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034162"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;7:20</a></span> &mdash; simply inquiring whether He had come as He whom he was looking for. <q>Are you He that should come?</q> <em>i.e.</em> Are you the coming One? <q>or look we for another?</q> <em>i.e.</em> Is He whom we are expecting some other than You, if You are not He whom we expect to come? For he was supposing,  as all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> then thought, from the similarity of the miraculous evidences,  that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> might possibly have been meanwhile sent, from whom the Lord Himself, whose coming was then expected, was different, and to whom He was superior.  And there lay John's difficulty.  He was in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether He was actually come whom all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were looking for; whom, moreover, they ought to have recognised by His predicted works, even as the Lord sent word to John, that it was by means of these very works that He was to be recognised. <span class="stiki" id="note034167"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;7:21-22</a></span> Now, inasmuch as these predictions evidently related to the Creator's Christ&mdash; as we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the examination of each of them&mdash; it was perverse enough, if he gave himself out to be <em>not</em> the Christ of the Creator, and rested the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his statement on those very evidences whereby he was urging his claims to be received as the Creator's Christ. Far greater still is his perverseness when, not being the Christ of John,  he yet bestows on John his testimony, affirming him to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, nay more, his messenger,  applying to him the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.</q>  He graciously  adduced the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in the superior sense of the alternative mentioned by the perplexed John, in order that, by affirming that His own precursor was already come in the person of John, He might quench the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>  which lurked in his question: <q>Are you He that should come, or look we for another?</q> Now that the forerunner had fulfilled his mission, and the way of the Lord was prepared, He ought now to be acknowledged as that (Christ) for whom the forerunner had made ready the way. <em>That forerunner was</em> indeed <q>greater than all of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> born;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034173"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;7:28</a></span> but for all that, He who was least in the kingdom of God  was not subject to him;  as if the kingdom in which the least person was greater than John belonged to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while John, who was greater than all of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> born, belonged himself to another God. For whether He speaks of <em>any</em> <q>least person</q> by reason of his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> position, or of Himself, as being thought to be less than John&mdash; since all were running into the wilderness after John rather than after Christ (<q>What did you go out into the wilderness to see?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034176"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;7:25</a></span>)&mdash; the Creator has equal right  to claim as His own both John, greater than any born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or every <q>least person <em>in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a></em>,</q> who was destined to be greater than John in that kingdom, although equally pertaining to the Creator, and who would be so much greater than the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,  because he would not have been offended at Christ, <em>an infirmity</em> which then lessened <em>the greatness of</em> John. We have already spoken of the forgiveness  of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The behaviour of <q>the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which was a sinner,</q> when she covered the Lord's feet with her kisses, bathed them with her tears, wiped them with the hairs of her head, anointed them with ointment, <span class="stiki" id="note034180"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;7:36-50</a></span> produced an evidence that what she handled was not an empty phantom,  but a really solid body, and that her repentance as a sinner deserved forgiveness according to the mind of the Creator, who is accustomed to prefer mercy to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note034182"><a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse6">Hosea&nbsp;6:6</a></span> But even if the stimulus of her repentance proceeded from her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, she heard her justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through her repentance pronounced in the words, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you,</q> by Him who had declared by Habakkuk, <q>The just shall live by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034183"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:4</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 19. The Rich Women of Piety Who Followed Jesus Christ's Teaching by Parables. The Marcionite Cavil Derived from Christ's Remark, When Told of His Mother and His Brethren. Explanation of Christ's Apparent Rejection Them.</h2>

<p>The fact that certain rich <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> clave to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>which ministered unto Him of their substance,</q> among whom was the wife of the king's steward, is a subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. By Isaiah <em>the Lord</em> called these <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> ladies&mdash; <q>Rise up, you <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that are at ease, and hear my voice</q> &mdash; that He might prove  them first as <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and then as assistants and helpers: <q>Daughters, hear my words in hope; this day of the year cherish the memory of, in labour with hope.</q> For it was <q>in labour</q> that they followed Him, and <q>with hope</q> did they minister to Him. On the subject of <em><a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a></em>, let it suffice that it has been once for all shown that this kind of language  was with equal distinctness promised by the Creator. But there is that direct mode of His speaking  to the people&mdash; <q>You shall hear with the ear, but you shall not understand</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034188"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;6:9</a></span> &mdash; which now claims notice as having furnished to Christ that frequent form of His earnest instruction: <q>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034189"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;8:8</a></span> Not as if Christ, actuated with a diverse spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused; but because the exhortation followed the threatening. First came, <q>You shall hear with the ear, but shall not understand;</q> then followed, <q>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</q> For they wilfully refused to hear, although they had ears. He, however, was teaching them that it was the ears of the heart which were necessary; and with <em>these</em> the Creator had said that they would not hear. Therefore it is that He adds by His Christ, <q>Take heed how you hear,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034190"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;8:18</a></span> and hear not&mdash;meaning, of course, with the hearing of the heart, not of the ear. If you only attach a proper sense to the <em>Creator's</em> admonition,  suitable to the meaning of Him who was rousing the people to hear by the words, <q>Take heed how you hear,</q> it amounted to a menace to such as would not hear. In fact,  that most merciful god of yours, who judges not, neither is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, is minatory. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> even by the sentence which immediately follows: <q>Whosoever has, to him shall be given; and whosoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034193"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;8:18</a></span> What shall be given? The increase of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or understanding, or even <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. What shall be taken away? That, of course, which shall be given. By whom shall the gift and the deprivation be made? If by the Creator it be taken away, by Him also shall it be given. If by <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god it be given, by <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god also will it be taken away. Now, for whatever reason He threatens the <q>deprivation,</q> it will not be the work of a god who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to threaten, because incapable of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. I am, moreover, astonished when he says that <q>a candle is not usually hidden,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034194"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;8:16</a></span> who had hidden himself&mdash; a greater and more needful light&mdash; during so long a time; and when he promises that <q>everything shall be brought out of its secrecy and made manifest,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034195"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;8:17</a></span> who hitherto has kept his god in obscurity, waiting (I suppose) until <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> be born. We now come to the most strenuously-plied argument of all those who call in question the Lord's nativity. They say that He testifies Himself to His not having been born, when He asks, <q>Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034196"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;12:48</a></span> In this manner <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> either wrest plain and simple words to any sense they choose by their conjectures, or else they violently resolve by a literal interpretation words which imply a conditional sense and are incapable of a simple solution,  as in this passage. We, for our part, say in reply, first, that it could not possibly have been told Him that His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to see Him, if He had had no mother and no brethren. They must have been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him who announced them, either some time previously, or then at that very time, when they desired to see Him, or sent Him their message. To this our first position this answer is usually given by the other side. But suppose they sent Him the message for the purpose of tempting Him? Well, but the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> does not say so; and inasmuch as it is usual for it to indicate what is done in the way of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> (<q>Behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034198"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;10:25</a></span> again, when inquiring about tribute, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> came to Him, tempting Him <span class="stiki" id="note034199"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;20:20</a></span>), so, when it makes no mention of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, it does not admit the interpretation of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. However, <em>although I do not allow this sense</em>, I may as well ask, by way of a superfluous refutation, for the reasons of the alleged <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, To what purpose could they have tempted Him by naming His mother and His brethren? If it was to ascertain whether He had been born or not&mdash; when was a question raised on this point, which they must resolve by tempting Him in this way? Who could <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> His having been born, when they  saw Him before them a veritable man?&mdash; whom they had heard call Himself <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>?</q>&mdash; of whom they <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether He were God or <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, from seeing Him, as they did, in the perfect garb of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> quality?&mdash; supposing Him rather to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, a great one indeed,  but still one who had been born as man? Even if it had been necessary that He should thus be tried in the investigation of His birth, surely any other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> would have better answered the trial than that to be obtained from mentioning those <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> which it was quite possible for Him, in spite of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nativity, not at that moment to have had. For tell me now, does a mother live on contemporaneously  with her sons in every case? Have all sons brothers born for them?  May a man rather not have fathers and sisters (living), or even no <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> at all? But there is historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>  that at this very time  a <em>census</em> had been taken in Jud&aelig;a by Sentius Saturninus,  which might have satisfied their inquiry respecting the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and descent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Such a method of testing the point had therefore no consistency whatever in it and they <q>who were standing without</q> were really <q>His mother and His brethren.</q> It remains for us to examine His meaning when He resorts to non-literal  words, saying <q>Who is my mother or my brethren?</q> It seems as if His language amounted to a denial of His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and His birth; but it arose actually from the absolute nature of the case, and the conditional sense in which His words were to be explained.  He was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> indignant, that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> so very near to Him <q>stood <em>without</em>,</q> while strangers were <em>within</em> hanging on His words, especially as they wanted to call Him away from the solemn work He had in hand. He did not so much deny as disavow  them. And therefore, when to the previous question, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?  He added the answer <q>None but they who hear my words and do them,</q> He transferred the names of blood-relationship to others, whom He judged to be more closely related to Him by reason of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now no one transfers a thing except from him who possesses that which is transferred. If, therefore, He made them <q>His mother and His brethren</q> who were not so, how could He deny them these relationships who really had them? Surely only on the condition of their deserts, and not by any disavowal of His near <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>; teaching them by His own actual example,  that <q>whosoever preferred father or mother or brethren to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, was not a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> worthy of Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034212"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;10:37</a></span> Besides,  His admission of His mother and His brethren was the more express, from the fact of His unwillingness to acknowledge them. That He adopted others only confirmed those in their relationship to Him whom He refused because of their offense, and for whom He substituted the others, not as being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, but worthier ones. Finally, it was no great matter if He did prefer to kindred (that) <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which it  did not possess. </p>

<p>But <q>what manner of man is this? For He commands even the winds and water!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034216"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;8:25</a></span> Of course He is the new master and proprietor of the elements, now that the Creator is deposed, and excluded from their possession! Nothing of the kind. But the elements own  their own Maker, just as they had been accustomed to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His servants also. Examine well the Exodus, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>; look at the rod of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as it waves His command to the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, ampler than all the lakes of Jud&aelig;a. How the sea yawns from its very depths, then fixes itself in two solidified masses, and so, out of the interval between them,  makes a way for the people to pass dry-shod across; again does the same rod vibrate, the sea returns in its strength, and in the concourse of its waters the chivalry of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is engulphed! To that consummation the very winds subserved! Read, too, how that the Jordan was as a sword, to hinder the emigrant nation in their passage across its stream; how that its waters from above stood still, and its current below wholly ceased to run at the bidding of Joshua, <span class="stiki" id="note034219"><a href="../bible/jos003.htm#verse9">Joshua&nbsp;3:9-17</a></span> when his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> began to pass over!  What will you say to this? If it be your Christ <em>that is meant above</em>, he will not be more potent than the servants of the Creator. But I should have been content with the examples I have adduced without addition,  if a prediction of His present passage on the sea had not preceded Christ's coming. As psalm is, in fact, accomplished by this  crossing over the lake. <q>The Lord,</q> says the psalmist, <q>is upon many waters.</q>  When He disperses its waves, Habakkuk's words are fulfilled, where he says, <q>Scattering the waters in His passage.</q>  When at His rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, <span class="stiki" id="note034225"><a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse4">Nahum&nbsp;1:4</a></span> including the winds indeed, whereby it was disquieted. With what evidence would you have my Christ vindicated? Shall it come from the examples, or from the prophecies, of the Creator? You suppose that He is predicted as a military and armed warrior,  instead of one who in a figurative and allegorical sense was to wage a spiritual warfare against spiritual enemies, in spiritual campaigns, and with spiritual weapons: come now, when in one man alone you discover a multitude of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> calling itself <em>Legion</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note034227"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;8:30</a></span> of course comprised of spirits, you should learn that Christ also must be understood to be an exterminator of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual arms and fights in spiritual strife; and that it was none other than He,  who now had to contend with even a legion of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Therefore it is of such a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> as this that the Psalm may evidently have spoken: <q>The Lord is strong, The Lord is mighty in battle.</q>  For with the last enemy death did He fight, and through the trophy of the cross He triumphed. Now of what God did the Legion testify that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the Son? <span class="stiki" id="note034230"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;8:28</a></span> No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, of that God whose torments and abyss they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and dreaded. It seems impossible for them to have remained up to this time in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of what the power of the recent and unknown god was working in the world, because it is very unlikely that the Creator was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> thereof. For if He had been at any time <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that there was another god above Himself, He had by this time at all events discovered that there was one at work  below His heaven. Now, what their Lord had discovered had by this time become notorious to His entire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> within the same world and the same circuit of heaven, in which the strange deity dwelt and acted.  As therefore both the Creator and His creatures  must have had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him, if he had been in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, so, inasmuch as he had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> really <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> none other than the Christ of their own God. They do not ask of the strange god, what they recollected they must beg of the Creator&mdash; not to be plunged into the Creator's abyss. They at last had their request granted. On what ground? Because they had lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be the Son of a ruthless God? And what sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld his detractors? However, <em>no need of this thought</em>, for,  inasmuch as they had not lied, inasmuch as they had acknowledged that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the abyss was also their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so did He actually Himself affirm that He was the same whom these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> acknowledged&mdash; Jesus, the Judge and Son of the avenging God. Now, behold an inkling  of the Creator's failings  and infirmities in Christ; for I on my side  mean to impute to Him <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Allow me some indulgence in my effort against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Jesus is touched by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had an issue of blood, <span class="stiki" id="note034238"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;8:43-46</a></span> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not by whom. <q>Who touched me?</q> He asks, when His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> alleged an excuse. He even persists in His assertion of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: <q>Somebody has touched me,</q> He says, and advances some <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>: <q>For I perceive that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is gone out of me.</q> What says our <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? Could <em>Christ</em> have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the person? And why did He speak as if He were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>? Why? Surely it was to challenge her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to try her <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Precisely as He had once questioned Adam, as if in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: Adam, where are you?  Thus you have both the Creator excused in the same way as Christ, and Christ acting similarly to  the Creator. But in this case He acted as an adversary of the law; and therefore, as the law forbids contact with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with an issue, <span class="stiki" id="note034241"><a href="../bible/lev015.htm#verse19">Leviticus&nbsp;15:19</a></span> He desired not only that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should touch Him, but that He should heal her.  Here, then, is a God who is not merciful by nature, but in hostility! Yet, if we find that such was the merit of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that He said unto her, Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you, <span class="stiki" id="note034243"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;8:48</a></span> what are you, that you should detect an hostility to the law in that act, which the Lord Himself shows us to have been done as a reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? But will you have it that this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> consisted in the contempt which she had acquired for the law? Who can suppose, that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had been. hitherto unconscious of any <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, uninitiated as yet in any new law, should violently infringe that law by which she was up to this time bound? On what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, indeed, was such an infringement hazarded? In what God believing? Whom despising? The Creator? Her touch at least was an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And if of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Creator, how could she have violated His law,  when she was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of any other God? Whatever her infringement of the law amounted to, it proceeded from and was proportionate to her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Creator. But how can these two things be compatible? That she violated the law, and violated it in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which ought to have restrained her from such violation? I will tell you how her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was this above all:  it made her <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that her God preferred mercy even to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; she was certain that her God was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man simply, nor as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, whom she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be capable of contamination by reason of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but as very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness.  She therefore, not without reason,  interpreted for herself the law, as meaning that such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> for certain to be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But she recollected this also, that what came under the prohibition of the law  was that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result of disordered health. Her case, however, was one of long abounding  ill health, for which she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the succour of God's mercy was needed, and not the <em>natural</em> relief of time. And thus she may evidently be regarded as having discerned  the law, instead of breaking it. This will prove to be the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was to confer intelligence likewise. <q>If you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> says (the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>), <q>you shall not understand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034251"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;7:9</a></span> When Christ approved of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, which simply rested in the Creator, He declared by His answer to her, <span class="stiki" id="note034252"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;8:48</a></span> that He was Himself the divine object of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of which He approved. Nor can I overlook the fact that His garment, by being touched, demonstrated also the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His body; for of course  it was a body, and not a phantom, which the garment clothed.  This indeed is not our point now; but the remark has a natural bearing on the question we are discussing. For if it were not a veritable body, but only a fantastic one, it could not for certain have received contamination, as being an unsubstantial thing.  He therefore, who, by reason of this vacuity of his substance, was incapable of contamination, how could he possibly have desired this touch?  As an adversary of the law, his conduct was deceitful, for he was not susceptible of a real pollution.</p>

<p>He sends forth His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note034257"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;9:1-6</a></span> Does He here say of what God?

But when He charges them to shake off the dust of their feet against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this be done as a <em><a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a></em>. Now no one bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> except in a case which is decided by judicial process; and whoever orders inhuman conduct to be submitted to the trial by testimony,   does really threaten as a judge. Again, that it was no new god which recommended  by Christ, was clearly attested by the opinion of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because some maintained to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the Christ; others, that He was John; some, that He was Elias; and others, that He was one of the old <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note034263"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;9:7-8</a></span> Now, whosoever of all these He might have been, He certainly was not raised up for the purpose of announcing another god after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>.

Or else,  if there was not the same grandeur, it follows that He is now inferior to the Creator. For <em>He</em>, not for one day, but during forty years, not on the inferior aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, supported the lives  of not five thousand, but of six hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings. However, such was the greatness <em>of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a></em>, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant;  and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Sarepta was multiplied  by the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> throughout the period of the famine.

Accordingly, when Peter, who had been an eye-<a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and had compared it with the ancient precedents, and had discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one day come to pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord's inquiry, <q>Whom do you say that I am?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034275"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;9:20</a></span> in the words, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> he could not but have perceived that He was that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, beside whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of none else in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and whom he was now surveying  in His wonderful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it. <span class="stiki" id="note034277"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;9:21</a></span> For if Peter was unable to acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator's <em>Christ</em>, while He commanded them <q>to tell no man that saying,</q> surely  He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged which Peter had drawn. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of that,  you say; but as Peter's conclusion was a wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> disseminated. It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and be slain, and be raised again the third day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034280"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;9:22</a></span> Now, inasmuch as these <em>sufferings</em> were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place ), so by this application of them to His own case  does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing silence (on the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake, that reason being the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of His undergoing these sufferings. <q>Whosoever,</q> says He, <q>will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034283"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;9:24</a></span> Surely  it is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>  who uttered this sentence.

Where is that novelty, which you pretend  in a doctrine which possesses these ancient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>? But all the predictions have been fulfilled  concerning <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> which were to happen, and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>See,</q> says Isaiah, <q>how the righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034290"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;57:i</a></span> When does this more frequently happen than in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,  no common casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me; one who returns <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <q>For whosoever,</q> says He, <q>shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034292"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;9:26</a></span> Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion  of such a shame as this. His whole course  was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, declaiming  with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace  of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.  But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed  into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh in the womb of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, although a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; never grew from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids  of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; was never deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called <em>f&oelig;tus</em>  after such shaping; was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb;  was never shed forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, immediately to inaugurate the light  of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;  never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> and honey;  nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling clothes;  nor afterwards did he ever wallow  in his own uncleanness, in his mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually  a boy; by slow degrees  a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.  But he was revealed  from heaven, full-grown at once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal he was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from the curse of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, the real endurance  of which he escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, <q>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.</q> But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;  <q>made</q> by the Father <q>a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q>  <q>a worm and no man, a reproach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and despised of the people;</q>  seeing that it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that <q>with His stripes we should be healed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034315"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;53:5</a></span> that by His humiliation our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> should be established. And <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> did He <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Himself  for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock, might with similar <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> give satisfaction to God for the shamelessness of his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in not being ashamed of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?  Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 22. The Same Conclusion Supported by the Transfiguration. Marcion Inconsistent in Associating with Christ in Glory Two Such Eminent Servants of the Creator as Moses and Elijah. St. Peter's Ignorance Accounted for on Montanist Principle.</h2>

<p>You ought to be very much ashamed of yourself on this account too, for permitting him to appear on the retired mountain in the company of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, <span class="stiki" id="note034319"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;9:28-36</a></span> whom he had come to destroy. This, to be sure,  was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: <q>This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, hear Him</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034321"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;9:35</a></span> &mdash; <em>Him</em>, that is, not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all  others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough  as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way  how he demonstrates them to be aliens,  even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>),  and revealed them just as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>! But what could so well befit the Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers? &mdash; to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?&mdash; to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?&mdash; to share His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; even with those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder  of His people, the other afterwards the reformer  thereof; one the initiator of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the other the consummator  of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here</q> (good: that evidently means to be where <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias are); <q>and let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and one for Elias. But he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what he said.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034331"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;9:33</a></span> How <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not? Was his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> the result of simple <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? Or was it on the principle which we maintain  in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>,  that to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> or rapture  is incident. For when a man is rapt in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, especially when he beholds the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,  because he is overshadowed with the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.  Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture  of Peter. For how could he have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, except (by being) in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>? People could not have had their images, or <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>? And therefore, because it was in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he had said. But if, on the other hand,  he was thus <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, <q>Whom they thought Him to be,</q> meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, <q>You are the Christ;</q> because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> here because of his previous erroneous opinion,  then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation  he, in fact, here described. He selects from His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. <q>In the mouth of three witnesses,</q> says He, <q>shall every word be established.</q>  He withdraws to a mountain. In the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with visible <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and His voice. It was only right that the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> should be attested  on such an elevated spot  as that whereon the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> had been composed;  under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, indeed, he  had brought down his own clouds there, because he had himself forced his way through the Creator's heaven;  or else it was only a precarious cloud,  as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the former)  occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, <q>You are my Son, today have I begotten you.</q>  By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, <q>Who is there among you that fears God? Let him hear the voice of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q>  When therefore He here presents Him with the words, <q>This is my (beloved) Son,</q> this clause is of course understood, <q>whom I have promised.</q> For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, <q>This is He,</q> it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose  that He should utter His voice in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, <q>This is my son,</q> concerning whom you have given us no previous information,  any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>? <q>Hear Him,</q> therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, since it was as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that He had to be regarded by the people. <q>A <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,</q> says <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons</q> (that is, of course, after a carnal descent ); <q>unto Him shall you hearken, as unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034354"><a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;18:15</a></span> <q>Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  shall be cut off from among his people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034356"><a href="../bible/deu018.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy&nbsp;18:19</a></span> So also Isaiah: <q>Who is there among you that fears God? Let him hear the voice of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034357"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;50:10</a></span> This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,  He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, <q>This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, hear Him.</q> Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> <q>hearing</q> from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias to  Christ, it is still not from another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to another Christ; but from  the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. <q>Not an ambassador, nor an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but He Himself,</q> says Isaiah, <q>shall save them;</q>  for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The Father gave to the Son new <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,  after that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias had been exhibited along with Him in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and had then been dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> information the fact that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias had a share in even the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But we have the entire structure  of this same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some  of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> says, <q>O Lord, I have heard Your speech, and was afraid.</q> What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, hear Him? <q>I considered your works, and was astonished.</q> When could this have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what he was saying? <q>In the midst of the two You shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></q>&mdash; even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias.  These likewise did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches.  For these are they of whom he says, <q>They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</q> And again Habakkuk says, <q>His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> covered the heavens</q> (that is, with that cloud), <q>and His splendour shall be like the light&mdash; even the light, wherewith His very raiment glistened.</q> And if we would make mention of  the promise to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, we shall find it accomplished here. For when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> desired to see the Lord, saying, <q>If therefore I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, manifest Yourself to me, that I may see You distinctly,</q>  the sight which he desired to have was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> was to occur. Respecting the <em>face</em> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, he had already heard, <q>No man shall see me, and live.</q> <q>This thing,</q> said He, <q>which you have spoken, will I do unto you.</q> Then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, <q>Show me Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> And the Lord, with like reference to the future, replied, <q>I will pass before you in my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> etc. Then at the last He says, <q>And then you shall see my back.</q>  Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold, but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which was to be revealed in the latter days.  He had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, <q>If there shall be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> among you, I will make myself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my manner to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; with <em>him</em> will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently</q> (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), <q>and not in dark speeches.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034371"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse6">Numbers&nbsp;12:6-8</a></span> Now, although <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> has denied  that he is here represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood <q>mouth to mouth,</q> he must also have stood <q>face to face</q> <em>with him</em>, to use his words,  not far from him, in His very <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash; not to say,  in His presence. And with this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> he went away enlightened from Christ, just as he used to do from the Creator; as <em>then</em> to dazzle the eyes of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, so <em>now</em> to smite those of the blinded <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, who has failed to see how this argument also makes against him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Impossible that Marcion's Christ Should Reprove the Faithless Generation. Such Loving Consideration for Infants as the True Christ Was Apt to Show, Also Impossible for the Other. On the Three Different Characters Confronted and Instructed by Christ in Samaria.</h2>

<p>I take on myself the character  of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Let <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ stand forth, and exclaim, <q>O faithless generation!  how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034377"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;9:41</a></span> He will immediately have to submit to this remonstrance from me: <q>Whoever you are, O stranger,  first tell us who you are, from whom you come, and what right you have over us. Thus far, all you possess  belongs to the Creator. Of course, if you come from Him, and are acting for Him, we will bear your reproof. But if you come from some other god, I should wish you to tell us what you have ever committed to us belonging to yourself,  which it was our duty to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, seeing that you are upbraiding us with 'faithlessness,' who have never yet revealed to us your own self. How long ago  did you begin to treat with us, that you should be complaining of the delay? On what points have you borne with us, that you should adduce  your patience? Like &AElig;sop's ass, you are just come from the well,  and are filling every place with your braying.</q> I assume, besides,  the person of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, against whom he has inveighed:  <q>O perverse nation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you?</q> This outburst of his I might, of course, retort upon him most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> in such words as these: <q>Whoever you are, O stranger, first tell us who you are, from whom you come, what right you have over us. Thus far, I suppose, you belong to the Creator, and so we have followed you, recognising in you all things which are His. Now, if you come from Him, we will bear your reproof. If, however, you are acting for another, prythee tell us what you have ever conferred upon us that is simply your own, which it had become our duty to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, seeing that you reproach us with 'faithlessness,' although up to this moment you show us no credentials. How long since did you begin to plead with us, that you are charging us with delay? Wherein have you borne with us, that you should even boast of your patience? The ass has only just arrived from &AElig;sop's well, and he is already braying.</q> Now who would not thus have rebutted the unfairness of the rebuke, if he had supposed its author to belong to him who had had no right as yet to complain? Except that not even He  would have inveighed against them, if He had not dwelt among them of old in the law and by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and with mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and many mercies, and had always experienced them to be <q>faithless.</q> But, behold, Christ takes  infants, and teaches how all ought to be like them, if they ever wish to be greater. <span class="stiki" id="note034388"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;9:47-48</a></span> The Creator, on the contrary,  let loose bears against children, in order to avenge His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elisha, who had been mocked by them. <span class="stiki" id="note034390"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse23">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:23-24</a></span> This antithesis is impudent enough, since it throws together  things so different as infants  and children, &mdash; an age still innocent, and one already capable of discretion&mdash; able to mock, if not to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>. As therefore God is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He spared not impious children, exacting as He does <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for every time of life, and especially, of course, from youth. And as God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, He so loves infants as to have blessed the midwives in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when they protected the infants of the Hebrews  which were in peril from <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> command. <span class="stiki" id="note034395"><a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse15">Exodus&nbsp;2:15-21</a></span> Christ therefore shares this kindness with the Creator. As indeed for <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god, who is an enemy to marriage, how can he possibly seem to be a lover of little children, which are simply the issue of marriage? He who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the seed must needs also detest the fruit. Yea, he ought to be deemed more ruthless than the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.  For whereas <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> forbade infants to be brought up, <em>he</em> will not allow them even to be born, depriving them of their ten months' <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the womb. And how much more credible it is, that kindness to little children should be attributed to Him who blessed matrimony for the procreation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and in such benediction included also the promise of connubial fruit itself, the first of which is that of infancy!  The Creator, at the request of Elias, inflicts the blow  of fire from heaven in the case of that <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> (of Baalzebub). <span class="stiki" id="note034399"><a href="../bible/2ki001.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;1:9-12</a></span> I recognise herein the severity of the Judge.

And, of course, him whom He rejected He condemned to the loss of not following the Saviour.  For as He calls to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> him whom He does not reject, or him whom He voluntarily invites, so does He consign to perdition him whom He rejects.

<h2>Chapter 24. On the Mission of the Seventy Disciples, and Christ's Charge to Them. Precedents Drawn from the Old Testament. Absurdity of Supposing that Marcion's Christ Could Have Given the Power of Treading on Serpents and Scorpions.</h2>

<p>He chose also seventy other missionaries  besides the twelve. Now why, if the twelve followed the number of the twelve fountains of Elim,  should not the seventy correspond to the like number of the palms of that place?  Whatever be the <em>Antitheses</em> of the comparison, it is a diversity in the causes, not in the powers, which has mainly produced them. But if one does not keep in view the diversity of the <em>causes</em>,  he is very apt to infer a difference of <em>powers</em>.  When the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the Creator brought them forth laden with their spoils of gold and silver vessels, and with loads besides of raiment and unleavened dough;  whereas Christ commanded His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not to carry even a staff  for their journey. The former were thrust forth into a desert, but the latter were sent into cities. Consider the difference presented in the occasions,  and you will understand how it was one and the same power which arranged the mission  of His people according to their poverty in the one case, and their plenty in the other. He cut down  their supplies when they could be replenished through the cities, just as He had accumulated  them when exposed to the scantiness of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Even shoes He forbade them to carry. For it was He under whose very protection the people wore not out a shoe, <span class="stiki" id="note034426"><a href="../bible/deu029.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;29:5</a></span> even in the wilderness for the space of so many years. <q>No one,</q> says He, <q>shall you salute by the way.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034427"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;10:4</a></span> What a destroyer of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, forsooth, is Christ, seeing it is from them that He received his precept also! When Elisha sent on his servant Gehazi before him to raise the Shunammite's son from death, I rather think he gave him these instructions:  <q>Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not;  and if any salute you, answer him not again.</q>  For what is a wayside blessing but a mutual salutation as men meet? So also the Lord commands: <q>Into whatsoever house they enter, let them say, Peace be to it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034431"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;10:5</a></span> Herein He follows the very same example. For Elisha enjoined upon his servant the same salutation when he met the Shunammite; he was to say to her: <q>Peace to your husband, peace to your child.</q>  Such will be rather our <em>Antitheses</em>; they compare Christ with, instead of sundering Him from, the Creator. <q>The labourer is worthy of his hire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034433"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;10:7</a></span> Who could better pronounce such a sentence than the Judge? For to decide that the workman deserves his wages, is in itself a judicial act. There is no award which consists not in a process of judgment. The law of the Creator on this point also presents us with a corroboration, for He judges that labouring oxen are as labourers worthy of their hire: <q>You shall not muzzle,</q> says He, <q>the ox when he treads out the grain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034434"><a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;25:4</a></span> Now, who is so good to man  as He who is also merciful to cattle? Now, when Christ pronounced labourers to be worthy of their hire, He, in fact, exonerated from blame that precept of the Creator about depriving the Egyptians of their gold and silver vessels.  For they who had built for the Egyptians their houses and cities, were surely workmen worthy of their hire, and were not instructed in a fraudulent act, but only set to claim compensation for their hire, which they were unable in any other way to exact from their masters.  That the kingdom of God was neither new nor unheard of, He in this way affirmed, while at the same time He bids them announce that it was near at hand. <span class="stiki" id="note034438"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;10:9</a></span> Now it is that which was once far off, which can be properly said to have become near. If, however, a thing had never <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previous to its becoming near, it could never have been said to have approached, because it had never <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> at a distance. Everything which is new and unknown is also sudden.  Everything which is sudden, then, first receives the accident of time  when it is announced, for it then first puts on appearance of form.  Besides it will be impossible for a thing either to have been tardy  all the while it remained unannounced,  or to have approached  from the time it shall begin to be announced.</p>

<p>He likewise adds, that they should say to such as would not receive them: <q>Notwithstanding be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034445"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;10:11</a></span> If He does not enjoin this by way of a commination, the injunction is a most useless one. For what mattered it to them that the kingdom was at hand, unless its approach was accompanied with judgment?&mdash; even for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of such as received the announcement thereof. How, if there can be a threat without its accomplishment, can you have in a threatening god, one that executes also, and in both, one that is a judicial being?  So, again, He commands that the dust be shaken off against them, as a testimony&mdash;the very particles of their ground which might cleave  to the sandal, not to mention  any other sort of communication with them. <span class="stiki" id="note034449"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;10:11</a></span> But if their churlishness  and inhospitality were to receive no vengeance from Him, for what purpose does He premise a testimony, which surely forbodes some threats? Furthermore, when the Creator also, in the book of Deuteronomy, forbids the reception of the Ammonites and the Moabites into the church,  because, when His people came from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, they fraudulently withheld provisions from them with inhumanity and inhospitality, <span class="stiki" id="note034452"><a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy&nbsp;23:3</a></span> it will be manifest that the prohibition of intercourse descended to Christ from Him. The form of it which He uses&mdash; <q>He that despises you, despises me</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034453"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;10:16</a></span> &mdash; the Creator had also addressed to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>Not against you have they murmured, but against me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034454"><a href="../bible/num014.htm#verse27">Numbers&nbsp;14:27</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, indeed, was as much an apostle as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The authority of both offices will have to be equally divided, as it proceeds from one and the same Lord, (the God) of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Who is He that shall bestow <q>the power of treading on serpents and scorpions?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034455"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;10:19</a></span> Shall it be He who is the Lord of all living creatures or he who is not god over a single lizard? Happily the Creator has promised by Isaiah to give this power even to little children, of putting their hand in the cockatrice den and on the hole of the young asps without at all receiving hurt. <span class="stiki" id="note034456"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;11:8-9</a></span> And, indeed, we are aware (without doing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the literal sense of the passage, since even these noxious animals have actually been unable to do hurt where there has been <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>) that under the figure of scorpions and serpents are portended <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, whose very prince is described  by the name of serpent, dragon, and every other most conspicuous beast in the power of the Creator.  This power the Creator conferred first of all upon His Christ, even as the ninetieth Psalm says to Him: <q>Upon the asp and the basilisk shall You tread; the lion and the dragon shall You trample under foot.</q>  So also Isaiah: <q>In that day the Lord God shall draw His sacred, great, and strong sword</q> (even His Christ) <q>against that dragon, that great and tortuous serpent; and He shall slay him in that day.</q>  But when the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>The way shall be called a clean and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> way; over it the unclean thing shall not pass, nor shall be there any unclean way; but the dispersed shall pass over it, and they shall not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> therein; no lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon; it shall not be found there,</q>  he points out the way of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by which we shall reach to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and then to this way of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he promises this utter crippling  and subjugation of all noxious animals. Lastly, you may discover the suitable times of the promise, if you read what precedes the passage: <q>Be strong, you weak hands and you feeble knees: then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be articulate.</q>  When, therefore, He proclaimed the benefits of His cures, then also did He put the scorpions and the serpents under the feet of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>&mdash; even He who had first received this power from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in order to bestow it upon others and then manifested it forth conformably to the order of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Christ Thanks the Father for Revealing to Babes What He Had Concealed from the Wise. This Concealment Judiciously Effected by the Creator. Other Points in St. Luke's Chap. X. Shown to Be Only Possible to the Creator's Christ.</h2>

<p>Who shall be invoked as the Lord of heaven, that does not first show Himself  to have been the maker thereof? For He says, <q>I thank you, (O Father,) and own You, Lord of heaven, because those things which had been hidden from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, You have revealed unto babes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034466"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;10:21</a></span> What things are these? And whose? And by whom hidden? And by whom revealed? If it was by <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god that they were hidden and revealed, it was an extremely iniquitous proceeding;  for nothing at all had he ever produced  in which anything could have been hidden&mdash; no prophecies, no <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, no visions, no evidences  of things, or words, or names, obscured by allegories and figures, or cloudy enigmas, but he had concealed the greatness even of himself, which he was with all his might revealing by his Christ. Now in what respect had the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> done wrong,  that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be hidden from them, when their wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> had been insufficient to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him? No way had been provided by himself,  by any declaration of his works, or any vestiges whereby they might become  wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. However, if they had even failed in any duty towards a god whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, suppose him now at last to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> still they ought not to have found a jealous god in him who is introduced as unlike the Creator. Therefore, since he had neither provided any materials in which he could have hidden anything, nor had any offenders from whom he could have hidden himself: since, again, even if he had had any, he ought not to have hidden himself from them, he will not now be himself the revealer, who was not previously the concealer; so neither will any be the Lord of heaven nor the Father of Christ but He in whom all these attributes consistently meet.  For He conceals by His preparatory apparatus of prophetic obscurity, the understanding of which is open to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (for <q>if you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not understand</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034474"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;7:9</a></span>); and He had offenders in those wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> ones who would not seek after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although He was to be discovered in His so many and mighty works, <span class="stiki" id="note034475"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;1:20-23</a></span> or who rashly philosophized about Him, and thereby furnished to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> their arts;  and lastly, He is a jealous God. Accordingly,  that which Christ thanks God for doing, He long ago  announced by Isaiah: <q>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> will I hide.</q>  So in another passage He intimates both that He has concealed, and that He will also reveal: <q>I will give unto them treasures that have been hidden, and secret ones will I discover to them.</q>  And again: <q>Who else shall scatter the tokens of ventriloquists,  and the devices of those who divine out of their own heart; turning wise men backward, and making their counsels foolish?</q>  Now, if He has designated His Christ as an enlightener of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, saying, <q>I have set you for a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>;</q>  and if we understand these to be meant in the word <em>babes</em> <span class="stiki" id="note034484"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;10:21</a></span> &mdash; as having been once dwarfs in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and infants in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and even now also babes in their lowliness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; we shall of course more easily understand how He who had once hidden <q>these things,</q> and promised a revelation of them through Christ, was the same God as He who had now revealed them unto babes. Else, if it was <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god who revealed the things which had been formerly hidden by the Creator, it follows  that he did the Creator's work by setting forth His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.  But he did it, say you, for His destruction, that he might refute them.  Therefore he ought to have refuted them to those from whom the Creator had hidden them, even the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. For if he had a kind intention in what he did, the gift of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was due to those from whom the Creator had detained it, instead of the <em>babes</em>, to whom the Creator had grudged no gift. But after all, it is, I presume, the edification    rather than the demolition  of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which we have thus far found effected in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <q>All things,</q> He says, <q>are delivered unto me of my Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034490"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> You may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, if He is the Christ of the Creator to whom all things belong; because the Creator has not delivered to a Son who is less than Himself all things, which He created by  Him, that is to say, by His Word. If, on the contrary, he is the notorious stranger,  what are the <q> <em>all things</em></q> which have been delivered to him by the Father? Are they the Creator's? Then the things which the Father delivered to the Son are good, and the Creator is therefore good, since all His <q>things</q> are good; whereas he  is no longer good who has invaded another's good (domains) to deliver it to his son, thus teaching <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>  of another's goods. Surely he must be a most mendacious being, who had no other means of enriching his son than by helping himself to another's property! Or else,  if nothing of the Creator's has been delivered to him by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by what right  does he claim for himself (authority over) man? Or again, if man has been delivered to him, and man alone, then man is not <q>all things.</q> But Scripture clearly says that a transfer of <em>all things</em> has been made to the Son. If, however, you should interpret this <q> <em>all</em></q> of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, that is, <em>all nations</em>, then the delivery of even <em>these</em> to the Son is within the purpose of the Creator:  <q>I will give You the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession.</q>  If, indeed, he has some things of his own, the whole of which he might give to his son, along with the <em>man</em> of the Creator, then show some one thing of them all, as a sample, that I may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; lest I should have as much reason not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all things belong to him, of whom I see nothing, as I have ground for believing that even the things which I see not are His, to whom belongs the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which I see. But <q>no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> who the Father is, but the Son; and who the Son is, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034499"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> And so it was an unknown god that Christ preached! And other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, too, prop themselves up by this passage; alleging in opposition to it that the Creator was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, both to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by familiar intercourse, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by nature. Well, how is it He Himself testifies that He was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? <q>But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and my people does not consider me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034500"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> nor to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: <q>For, behold,</q> says He, <q>of the nations I have no man.</q>  Therefore He reckoned them <q>as the drop of a bucket,</q>  while <q>Sion He left as a look-out  in a vineyard.</q>  See, then, whether there be not here a confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> word, when he rebukes that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of man toward God which continued to the days of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. For it was on this account that he inserted the clause that the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by him to whom the Son has revealed Him, because it was even He who was announced as set by the Father to be a light to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who of course required to be enlightened concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as well as to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, even by imparting to it a fuller <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Arguments, therefore, will be of no use for belief in the rival god which may be suitable  for the Creator, because it is only such as are unfit for the Creator which will be able to advance belief in His rival. If you look also into the next words, <q>Blessed are the eyes which see the things which you see, for I tell you that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have not seen the things which you see,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034506"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;10:23-24</a></span> you will find that they follow from the sense above, that no man indeed had come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God as he ought to have done,  since even the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had not seen the things which were being seen under Christ. Now if He had not been my Christ, He would not have made any mention of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in this passage. For what was there to wonder at, if they had not seen the things of a god who had been unknown to them, and was only revealed a long time after them? What blessedness, however, could theirs have been, who were then seeing what others were naturally  unable to see, since it was of things which they had never predicted that they had not obtained the sight;  if it were not because they might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>  have seen the things pertaining to their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which they had even predicted, but which they at the same time  had not seen? This, however, will be the blessedness of others, even of such as were seeing the things which others had only foretold. We shall by and by show, nay, we have already shown, that in Christ those things were seen which had been foretold, but yet had been hidden from the very <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who foretold them, in order that they might be hidden also from the wise and the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, a certain doctor of the law comes to the Lord and asks, <q>What shall I do to inherit <em><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></em> life?</q> In the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> gospel life only is mentioned, without the attribute <em><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></em>; so that the lawyer seems to have consulted Christ simply about the life which the Creator in the law promises to prolong,  and the Lord to have therefore answered him according to the law, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your strength,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034513"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;10:27</a></span> since the question was concerning the conditions of <em>mere</em> life. But the lawyer of course <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> very well in what way the life which the law meant  was to be obtained, so that his question could have had no relation to the life whose rules he was himself in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of teaching. But seeing that even the dead were now raised by Christ, and being himself excited to the hope of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life by these examples of a restored  one, he would lose no more time in merely looking on (at the wonderful things which had made him) so high in hope.  He therefore consulted him about the attainment of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Accordingly, the Lord, being Himself the same,  and introducing no new precept other than that which relates above all others  to (man's) entire <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, even including the present and the future life,  places before him  the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>  of the law&mdash; that he should in every possible way <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord his God. If, indeed, it were only about a lengthened life, such as is at the Creator's disposal, that he inquired and Christ answered, and not about the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, which is at the disposal of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god, how is he to obtain the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> one? Surely not in the same manner as the prolonged life. For in proportion to the difference of the reward must be supposed to be also the diversity of the services. Therefore your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>,  will not obtain his <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life in consequence of loving your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the same way as the man who loves the Creator will secure the lengthened life. But how happens it that, if He is to be loved who promises the prolonged life, He is not much more to be loved who offers the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life? Therefore both one and the other life will be at the disposal of one and the same Lord; because one and the same discipline is to be followed  for one and the other life. What the Creator teaches to be loved, that must He necessarily maintain  also by Christ,  for that rule holds good here, which prescribes that greater things ought to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> of Him who has first lesser <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> to show, than of him for whom no preceding smaller presumptions have secured a claim to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in things of higher import. It matters not  then, whether the word <em><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></em> has been interpolated by us.  It is enough for me, that the Christ who invited men to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>&mdash; not the lengthened&mdash; life, when consulted about the temporal life which he was destroying, did not choose to exhort the man rather to that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life which he was introducing. Pray, what would the Creator's Christ have done, if He who had made man for loving the Creator did not belong to the Creator? I suppose He would have said that the Creator was not to be loved!</p>

<p>When in a certain place he had been <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to that Father above, <span class="stiki" id="note034528"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;11:1</a></span> looking up with insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His rough and cruel nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning&mdash; just as it was by Him contrived that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross  at Jerusalem&mdash; one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to him and said, <q>Master, teach us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, as John also taught his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q> This he said, forsooth, because he thought that different <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were required for different gods! Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, before he had learned whom he was to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, let me tell you  that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, to whom John's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also used to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, this <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly  would not have taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before He had given him the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to Him whom the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> had already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. In short, you may discover in the import  of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, <q>Father?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034533"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;11:2</a></span> To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?  Of whom can I ask for His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;  or of Him <q>who makes His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spirits,</q> and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters. <span class="stiki" id="note034536"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> Whose kingdom shall I wish to come&mdash; his, of whom I never heard as the king of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily <span class="stiki" id="note034537"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;11:3</a></span> bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;  or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>?  Who shall forgive me my trespasses? <span class="stiki" id="note034540"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;11:4</a></span> He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>? He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand condemned  the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> tempter? If any one, with such a form,  invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; he only blasphemes.  In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me? <span class="stiki" id="note034544"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;11:9</a></span> Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health  and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.  In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),  he could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,  was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude  represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.  Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age  and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet  seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which was then knocked at by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, <q>because of his importunity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034553"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;11:8</a></span> <em>Importunate</em>, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).  Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as <q>Father.</q> It is even He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails&mdash; not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion. <span class="stiki" id="note034555"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;11:11-13</a></span> It will, however, appertain to Him not to give <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, at whose command  is also the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> spirit. When He cast out the <q><a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> which was dumb</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034557"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;11:14</a></span> (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah), <span class="stiki" id="note034558"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;29:18</a></span> and having been charged with casting out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, He said, <q>If I by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, by whom do your sons cast them out?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034559"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;11:19</a></span> By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did&mdash; that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, <q>If I by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, etc., by whom your sons?</q>&mdash; as if He would reproach them with having the power of <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>&mdash;you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that <q><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> cannot be divided against himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034560"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;11:18</a></span> So that it was not by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> that even they were casting out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: <q>But if I with the finger of God cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034561"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;11:20</a></span> For the magicians who stood before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and resisted <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> called the power of the Creator <q> <em>the finger of God</em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034562"><a href="../bible/exo008.htm#verse19">Exodus&nbsp;8:19</a></span> It was the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it was a sign  that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,  He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under  whom it had received this appellation. <em>His</em> kingdom, therefore, had come near to them, whose power was called His <q>finger.</q> Well, therefore, did He connect  with the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of <q>the strong man armed,</q> whom <q>a stronger man still overcame,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034567"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;11:21-22</a></span> the prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom He had already called <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not that the Creator had been subdued by another god. Besides,  how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god could possibly seem to have overcome as <q>the stronger than He,</q> if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution  to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?  <q>A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, 'Blessed is the womb that bare You, and the paps which You have sucked;' but the Lord said, 'Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and keep it.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034571"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;11:27-28</a></span> Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, while preferring those who heard and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> God.  His mother, however, was not here present with Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son by birth.  On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time transferred, as He had done before,  the <q>blessedness</q> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> from the womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a real mother) He could not have transferred it.</p>

<p>I prefer elsewhere refuting  the faults which the Marcionites find in the Creator. It is here enough that they are also found in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  Behold how unequal, inconsistent, and capricious he is! Teaching one thing and doing another, he enjoins <q>giving to every one that seeks;</q> and yet he himself refuses to give to those <q>who seek a sign.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034577"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;11:29</a></span> For a vast age he hides his own light from men, and yet says that a candle must not be hidden, but affirms that it ought to be set upon a candlestick, that it may give light to all. <span class="stiki" id="note034578"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;11:33</a></span> He forbids cursing <em>again</em>, and cursing much more of course; and yet he heaps his <em>woe</em> upon the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and doctors of the law.  Who so closely resembles my God as His own Christ? We have often already laid it down for certain,  that He could not have been branded  as the destroyer of the law if He had promulged another god. Therefore even the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, who invited Him to dinner in the passage before us,  expressed some surprise  in His presence that He had not washed before He sat down to meat, in accordance with the law, since it was the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the law that He was proclaiming.  Jesus also interpreted the law to him when He told him that they <q>made clean the outside of the cup and the platter, whereas their inward part was full of ravening and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> <em>This He said</em>, to signify that by the cleansing of vessels was to be understood before God the purification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, inasmuch as it was about a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not about an unwashed vessel, that even this <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> had been treating in His presence. He therefore said: <q>You wash the outside of the cup,</q> that is, the flesh, <q>but you do not cleanse your inside part,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034585"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;11:39</a></span> that is, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; adding: <q>Did not He that made the outside,</q> that is, the flesh, <q>also make the inward part,</q> that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?&mdash; by which assertion He expressly declared that to the same God belongs the cleansing of a man's external and internal nature, both alike being in the power of Him who prefers mercy not only to man's washing,  but even to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.  For He subjoins the command: <q>Give what you possess as <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and all things shall be clean unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034588"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;11:41</a></span> Even if another god could have enjoined mercy, he could not have done so previous to his becoming <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Furthermore, it is in this passage evident that they  were not reproved concerning their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but concerning a point of His instruction to them, when He prescribed to them figuratively the cleansing of their vessels, but really the works of merciful dispositions. In like manner, He upbraids them for tithing paltry herbs,  but at the same time <q>passing over hospitality  and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034592"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;11:42</a></span> The vocation and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but Him by whose law of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> they used to offer their rue and mint? For the whole point of the rebuke lay in this, that they cared about small matters in His service of course, to whom they failed to exhibit their weightier duties when He commanded them: <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your strength, the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has called you out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034593"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:5</a></span> Besides, time enough had not yet passed to admit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> requiring so premature&mdash; nay, as yet so distasteful &mdash; a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards a new and recent, not to say a hardly yet developed,  deity. When, again, He upbraids those who caught at the uppermost places and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of public salutations, He only follows out the Creator's course,  who calls ambitious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of this character <q>rulers of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034597"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;1:10</a></span> who forbids us <q>to put confidence even in princes,</q>  and pronounces him to be altogether wretched who places his confidence in man. But whoever  aims at high position, because he would <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the officious attentions  of other people, (in every such case,) inasmuch as He forbade such attentions (in the shape) of placing hope and confidence in man, He at the same time  censured all who were ambitious of high positions. He also inveighs against the doctors of the law themselves, because they were <q>lading men with burdens grievous to be borne, which they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their own;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034602"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;11:46</a></span> but not as if He made a mock of  the burdens of the law with any feeling of detestation towards it. For how could He have felt aversion to the law, who used with so much earnestness to upbraid them for passing over its weightier matters, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>&mdash; giving, hospitality,  and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God? Nor, indeed, was it only these great things (which He recognized), but even  the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of rue and the cleansing of cups. But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, He would rather have deemed them excusable for being unable to carry burdens which could not be borne. What, then, are the burdens which He censures?  None but those which they were accumulating of their own accord, when they taught for commandments the doctrines of men; for the sake of private advantage joining house to house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; cajoling  the people, loving gifts, pursuing rewards, robbing the poor of the rights of judgment, that they might have the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> for a prey and the fatherless for a spoil.  Of these Isaiah also says, <q>Woe unto them that are strong in Jerusalem!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034609"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;28:14</a></span> and again, <q>They that demand you shall rule over you.</q>  And who did this more than the lawyers?  Now, if these offended Christ, it was as belonging to Him that they offended Him. He would have aimed no blow at the teachers of an alien law. But why is a <q>woe</q> pronounced against them for <q>building the sepulchres of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> whom their fathers had killed?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034612"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;11:47</a></span> They rather deserved praise, because by such an act of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> they seemed to show that they did not allow the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of their fathers. Was it not because (Christ) was jealous  of such a disposition as the Marcionites denounce,  visiting the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the fathers upon the children unto the fourth generation? What <q>key,</q> indeed, was it which these lawyers had, <span class="stiki" id="note034615"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse52">Luke&nbsp;11:52</a></span> but the interpretation of the law? Into the perception of this they neither entered themselves, even because they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> (for <q>unless you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you shall not understand</q>); nor did they permit others to enter, because they preferred to teach them for commandments even the doctrines of men. When, therefore, He reproached those who did not themselves enter in, and also shut the door against others, must He be regarded as a disparager of the law, or as a supporter of it? If a disparager, those who were hindering the law ought to have been pleased; if a supporter, He is no longer an enemy of the law.  But all these imprecations He uttered in order to tarnish the Creator as a cruel Being,  against whom such as offended were destined to have a <q>woe.</q> And who would not rather have feared to provoke a cruel Being,  by withdrawing allegiance  from Him? Therefore the more He represented the Creator to be an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, the more earnestly would He teach that He ought to be served. Thus would it behoove the Creator's Christ to act.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Examples from the Old Testament, Balaam, Moses, and Hezekiah, to Show How Completely the Instruction and Conduct of Christ  Are in Keeping with the Will and Purpose of the Creator.</h2>

<p>Justly, therefore, was the hypocrisy of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> displeasing to Him, loving God as they did with their lips, but not with their heart. <q>Beware,</q> He says to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, which is hypocrisy,</q> not the proclamation of the Creator. The Son <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> those who refused <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>  to the Father; nor does He wish His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to show such a disposition towards <em>Him</em>&mdash; not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> against. It is the example of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of unbelief, because (while holding the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, <q>There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034622"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;12:2</a></span> in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god. When He remarks also on their murmurs and taunts, in saying of Him, <q>This man casts out devils only through <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>,</q> <em>He means</em> that all these imputations would come forth to the light of day, and be in the mouths of men in consequence of the promulgation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. He then turns to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with these words, <q>I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034623"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;12:4</a></span> They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, <q>See how the just man is taken away, and no man lays it to heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034624"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;57:1</a></span> <q>But I will show you whom you shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him who, after He has killed, has power to cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a></q> (meaning, of course, the Creator); <q>yea, I say unto you, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034625"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;12:5</a></span> Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offense being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected  whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very <em>God</em> for whom He procures this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, this absence of offense, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: <q>For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034627"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;12:8</a></span> Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain  before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confessing Him: <q>Every one that denies me before men shall be denied before God</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034629"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;12:9</a></span> &mdash; by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed <em>God</em>. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will also deny the denier of Himself. Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> after his violent death,  it is the denier to whom everything will become fearful after his natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he will plainly have to suffer from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Creator's <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. After deterring <em>His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a></em> from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>: <q>Whosoever shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034631"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;12:10</a></span> Now, if both the remission and the retention of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> savour of a judicial <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who is not to be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Now, since it is Christ who averts <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> from the Creator, I am at a loss to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what manner His adversary  could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure  over the severity of Him who will not forgive <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and will kill even to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When <q>brought before magistrates,</q> and examined, He forbids them <q>to take thought how they shall answer;</q> <q>for,</q> says He, <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034634"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;12:11-12</a></span> If such an injunction  as this comes from the Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, with whom he was commencing <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, was at the same moment  filled with the Spirit. Instead of the curse which he had come to pronounce, he uttered the blessing which the Spirit at that very hour inspired him with; having previously declared to the king's messengers, and then to the king himself, that he could only speak forth that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should put into his mouth. <span class="stiki" id="note034637"><a href="../bible/num022.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xxii.-xxiv</a></span> The novel doctrines of the new Christ are such as the Creator's servants initiated long before! But see how clear a difference there is between the example of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> voluntarily interferes with brothers  who were quarrelling, and chides the offender: <q>Wherefore do you smite your fellow?</q> He is, however, rejected by him: <q>Who made you a prince or a judge over us?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034640"><a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;2:13-14</a></span> Christ, on the contrary, when requested by a certain man to compose a strife between him and his brother about dividing an inheritance, refused His assistance, although in so honest a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Well, then, my <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is better than your Christ, aiming as he did at the peace of brethren, <em>and</em> obviating their wrong. But <em>of course the case must be different with Christ</em>, for he is the Christ of the simply good and non-judicial god. <q>Who,</q> says he, <q>made me a judge over you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034641"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;12:13-14</a></span> No other word of excuse was he able to find, without using  that with which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, man and impious brother had rejected  the defender of probity and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>! In short, he approved of the excuse, although a bad one, by his use of it; and of the act, although a bad one, by his refusal to make peace between brothers. Or rather, would He not show His resentment  at the rejection of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> with such a word? And therefore did He not wish in a similar case of contentious brothers, to confound them with the recollection of so harsh a word? Clearly so. For He had Himself been present in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who heard such a rejection&mdash; even He, the Spirit of the Creator.  I think that we have already, in another passage,  sufficiently shown that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of riches is condemned by our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>who puts down the mighty from their throne, and exalts the poor from the dunghill.</q>  From Him, therefore, will proceed the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the rich man, who flattered himself about the increase of his fields, and to Whom God said: <q>You fool, this night shall they require your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of you; then whose shall those things be which you have provided?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034648"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;12:16-20</a></span> It was just in the like manner that the king <em>Hezekiah</em> heard from Isaiah the sad doom of his kingdom, when he gloried, before the envoys of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>,  in his treasures and the deposits of his precious things. <span class="stiki" id="note034650"><a href="../bible/isa039.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;xxxix</a></span> </p>

<p>Who would be unwilling that we should distress ourselves  about sustenance for our life, or clothing for our body, <span class="stiki" id="note034652"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;12:22-28</a></span> but He who has provided these things already for man; and who, therefore, while distributing them to us, prohibits all anxiety respecting them as an outrage  against his liberality?&mdash; who has adapted the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <q>life</q> itself to a condition <q>better than meat,</q> and has fashioned the material of <q>the body,</q> so as to make it <q>more than raiment;</q> whose <q>ravens, too, neither sow nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and are yet fed</q> by Himself; whose <q>lilies and grass also toil not, nor spin, and yet are clothed</q> by Him; whose <q>Solomon, moreover, was transcendent in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and yet was not arrayed like</q> the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> flower.  Besides, nothing can be more abrupt than that one God should be distributing His bounty, while the other should bid us take no thought about (so kindly a) distribution&mdash; and that, too, with the intention of derogating (from his liberality). Whether, indeed, it is as depreciating the Creator that he does not wish such trifles to be thought of, concerning which neither the crows nor the lilies labour, because, forsooth, they come spontaneously to hand  by reason of their very worthlessness,  will appear a little further on. Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being <q>of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034657"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;12:28</a></span> What <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Does He mean that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed,  and whom they were in process of learning as well as they could; or that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, <q>For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034659"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;12:30</a></span> even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom He remarked that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were quite wanting in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. When He further adds, <q>But your Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that you have need of these things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034660"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;12:30</a></span> I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that food and raiment are necessary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he really affirmed that they are <em>good</em>. For nothing that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer  which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that <em><a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ</em> himself promises them? <span class="stiki" id="note034662"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;12:31</a></span> Is he liberal with another's property?  <q>Seek,</q> says he, <q>the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and <em>all</em> these things shall be added unto you</q>&mdash; by himself, of course. But if <em>by himself</em>, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by <em>the Creator</em>, whose all things are, then who  is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are <q>additions</q> to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;  and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality  of its <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, the perfect equalization  of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.  We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought <q>to have our loins girded:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034669"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;12:35</a></span> in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; <q>to have our lights burning,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034670"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;12:35</a></span> that is, our minds kindled by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and resplendent with the works of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And thus <q>to wait for our Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034671"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;12:36</a></span> that is, Christ. Whence <q>returning?</q> If <q>from the wedding,</q> He is <em>the Christ</em> of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the nuptial bed. The <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that <q>thief, whose hour, if the father of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> had only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034672"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;12:39</a></span> How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he  rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.  Again, when He indicates to us that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is <q>the thief,</q> whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, he would never have been broken in upon  by him, He warns us <q>to be ready,</q> for this reason, because <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the hour when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall come</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034676"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;11:40</a></span> &mdash; not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim  the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>,</q> that he may give us some presage  of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired &mdash; that in <em>as</em> far as He insists on the Creator as an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in <em>so</em> far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> <q>unto them, or even to all,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034680"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;12:41</a></span> He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, the similitude of stewards.  That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware <span class="stiki" id="note034682"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;12:41-46</a></span> &mdash; even that <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,  or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god&mdash;as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since their separation will be from those who shall attain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers?  Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> shall attain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of retribution can I understand by Him who shall <q>beat His servants with stripes,</q> either <q>few or many,</q> and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable  for me to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, but Him who remunerates?

Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof.

He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, <q>The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034695"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse53">Luke&nbsp;12:53</a></span> Since this battle among the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>  was sung by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> trumpet in the very words, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that Micah <span class="stiki" id="note034697"><a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse6">Micah&nbsp;7:6</a></span> must have predicted it to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ!

The same God who had taught them to act as He commanded them,  was now requiring that they should act of their own accord.  He who had sown the precept, was now pressing to an abundant harvest from it. But how absurd, that he should now be commanding them to judge righteously, who was destroying God the righteous Judge!

<h2>Chapter 30. Parables of the Mustard-Seed, and of the Leaven. Transition to the Solemn Exclusion Which Will Ensue When the Master of the House Has Shut the Door. This Judicial Exclusion Will Be Administered by Christ, Who is Shown Thereby to Possess the Attribute of the Creator.</h2>

<p>When the question was again raised concerning a cure performed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, how did He discuss it: <q>Does not each of you on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> loose his ass or his ox from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034709"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;13:15</a></span> When, therefore, He did a work according to the condition prescribed by the law, He affirmed, instead of breaking, the law, which commanded that no work should be done, except what might be done for any living being;  <em>and if for any one</em>, then how much more for a <em><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a></em> life? In the case of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, it is allowed that I  everywhere require a congruity. <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> says He, <q>is like a grain of mustard-seed which a man took and cast into his garden.</q> Who must be understood as meant by the <em>man</em>? Surely Christ, because (although <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a>) he was called <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</q> He received from the Father the seed of the kingdom, that is, the word of the gospel, and sowed it in his garden&mdash; in the world, of course &mdash; in man at the present day, for instance.  Now, whereas it is said, <q> <em>in his garden</em>,</q> but neither the world nor man is his property, but the Creator's, therefore He who sowed seed in His own ground is shown to be the Creator. Else, if, to evade this snare,  they should choose to transfer the person of <em>the man</em> from Christ to any person who receives the seed of the kingdom and sows it in the garden of his own heart, not even this meaning  would suit any other than the Creator. For how happens it, if the kingdom belong to the most lenient god, that it is closely followed up by a fervent judgment, the severity of which brings weeping?  With regard, indeed, to the following similitude, I have my fears lest it should somehow  presage the kingdom of the rival god! For He compared it, not to the unleavened bread which the Creator is more familiar with, but to <em>leaven</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note034718"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;13:20-21</a></span> Now this is a capital conjecture for men who are begging for arguments. I must, however, on my side, dispel one fond conceit by another,  and contend with even <em>leaven</em> is suitable for the kingdom of the Creator, because after it comes <em>the oven</em>, or, if you please,  the furnace of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. How often has He already displayed Himself as a Judge, and in the Judge the Creator? How often, indeed, has He repelled, and in the repulse condemned? In the present passage, for instance, He says, <q>When once the master of the house is risen up;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034721"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;13:25</a></span> but in what sense except that in which Isaiah said, <q>When He arises to shake terribly the earth?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034722"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;2:19</a></span> <q>And has shut to the door,</q> thereby shutting out the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, of course; and when these knock, He will answer, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not whence you are;</q> and when they recount how <q>they have eaten and drunk in His presence,</q> He will further say to them, <q>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034723"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;13:25-28</a></span> But where? Outside, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, when they shall have been excluded with the door shut on them by Him. There will therefore be punishment inflicted by Him who excludes for punishment, when they shall behold the righteous entering the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, but themselves detained without. By whom detained outside? If by the Creator, who shall be <em>within</em> receiving the righteous into the kingdom? The good God. What, therefore, is the Creator about,  that He should detain outside for punishment those whom His adversary shut out, when He ought rather to have kindly received them, if they must come into His hands,  for the greater irritation of His rival? But when about to exclude the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, he must, of course, either be aware that the Creator would detain them for punishment, or not be aware. Consequently either the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will be detained <em>by the Creator</em> against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the excluder, in which case he will be inferior to the Creator, submitting to Him unwillingly; or else, if the process is carried out with his will, then he himself has judicially determined its execution; and then he who is the very originator of the Creator's <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, will not prove to be one whit better than the Creator. Now, if these ideas be incompatible with reason&mdash; of one being supposed to punish, and the other to liberate&mdash; then to one only power will appertain both the judgment and the kingdom and while they both belong to one, He who executes judgment can be none else than <em>the Christ</em> of the Creator.</p>

The Absurdity of the Marcionite Interpretation.</h2>

<p>What kind of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> does He bid should be invited to a dinner or a supper? <span class="stiki" id="note034726"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;14:12-14</a></span> Precisely such as he had pointed out by Isaiah: <q>Deal your bread to the hungry man; and the beggars&mdash; even such as have no home&mdash; bring in to your house,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034727"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;58:7</a></span> because, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, they are <q>unable to recompense</q> your act of humanity. Now, since Christ forbids the recompense to be expected now, but promises it <q>at the resurrection,</q> this is the very plan  of the Creator, who dislikes those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> gifts and follow after reward. Consider also to which deity  is better suited the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of him who issued invitations: <q>A certain man made a great supper, and bade many.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034730"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;14:16</a></span> The preparation for the supper is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a figure of the abundant provision  of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. I first remark, that strangers, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unconnected by ties of relationship, are not usually invited to a supper; but that members of the household and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are more frequently the favoured guests. To the Creator, then, it belonged to give the invitation, to whom also appertained those who were to be invited&mdash; whether considered as <em>men</em>, through their descent from Adam, or as <em><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>, by reason of their fathers; not to him who possessed no claim to them either by nature or prerogative. My next remark is,  if He issues the invitations who has prepared the supper, then, in this sense the supper is the Creator's, who sent to warn the guests. These had been indeed previously invited by the fathers, but were to be admonished by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. <em>It certainly is not the feast of him</em> who never sent a messenger to warn&mdash; who never did a thing before towards issuing an invitation, but came down himself on a sudden&mdash; only then  beginning to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, when already  giving his invitation; only then inviting, when already compelling to his banquet; appointing one and the same hour both for the supper and the invitation. But when invited, they excuse themselves. <span class="stiki" id="note034735"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;14:18</a></span> And fairly enough, if the invitation came from the other god, because it was so sudden; if, however, the excuse was not a fair one, then the invitation was not a sudden one. Now, if the invitation was not a sudden one, it must have been given by the Creator&mdash; even by Him of old time, whose call they had at last refused. They first refused it when they said to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, <q>Make us gods, which shall go before us;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034736"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;32:1</a></span> and again, afterwards, when <q>they heard indeed with the ear, but did not understand</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034737"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;6:10</a></span> their calling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In a manner most germane  to this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, He said by Jeremiah: <q>Obey my voice, and I will be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you shall be my people; and you shall walk in all my ways, which I have commanded you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034739"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:23</a></span> This is the invitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>But,</q> says He, <q>they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034740"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse24">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:24</a></span> This is the refusal of the people. <q>They departed, and walked every one in the imagination of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034741"><a href="../bible/jer011.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;11:8</a></span> <q>I have bought a field&mdash; and I have bought some oxen&mdash; and I have married a wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034742"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;14:18-20</a></span> And still He urges them: <q>I have sent unto you all my servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, rising early even before daylight.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is here meant, the admonisher of the guests. <q>Yet my people hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034744"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse26">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:26</a></span> This was reported to the Master of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Then He was moved (He did well to be moved; for, as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> denies emotion to his god, He must be therefore my God), and commanded them to invite out of <q>the streets and lanes of the city.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034745"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;14:21</a></span> Let us see whether this is not the same in purport as His words by Jeremiah: <q>Have I been a wilderness to the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, or a land left uncultivated?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034746"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse31">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:31</a></span> That is to say: <q>Then have I none whom I may call to me; have I no place whence I may bring them?</q> <q>Since my people have said, We will come no more unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034747"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse31">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:31</a></span> Therefore He sent out to call others, but from the same city. <span class="stiki" id="note034748"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;14:23</a></span> My third remark is this,  that although the place abounded with people, He yet commanded that they gather men from the highways and the hedges. In other words, we are now gathered out of the Gentile strangers; with that jealous resentment, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, which He expressed in Deuteronomy: <q>I will hide my face from them, and I will show them what shall happen in the last days  (how that others shall possess their place); for they are a froward generation, children in whom is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They have moved me to jealousy by that which is no god, and they have provoked me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people: I will provoke them to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> with a foolish nation</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034751"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse20">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:20-21</a></span> &mdash; even with us, whose hope the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> still entertain.  But this hope the Lord says they should not realize;  <q>Sion being left as a cottage  in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034755"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;1:8</a></span> since the nation rejected the latest invitation to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. (Now, I ask,) after going through all this course of the Creator's dispensation and prophecies, what there is in it which can possibly be assigned to him who has done all his work at one hasty stroke,  and possesses neither the Creator's  course nor His dispensation in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>? Or, again in what will consist his first invitation,  and what his admonition  at the second stage? Some at first would surely decline; others afterwards must have accepted.  But now he comes to invite both parties promiscuously out of the city,  out of the hedges,  contrary to the drift  of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>. It is impossible for him now to condemn as scorners of his invitation  those whom he has never yet invited, and whom he is approaching with so much earnestness. If, however, he condemns them beforehand as about to reject his call, then beforehand he also predicts  the election of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in their stead. Certainly  he means to come the second time for the very purpose of preaching to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. But even if he does mean to come again, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> it will not be with the intention of any longer inviting guests, but of giving to them their places. Meanwhile, you who interpret the call to this supper as an invitation to a heavenly banquet of spiritual satiety and pleasure, must remember that the earthly promises also of wine and oil and grain, and even of the city, are equally employed by the Creator as figures of spiritual things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. A Sort of Sorites, as the Logicians Call It, to Show that the Parables of the Lost Sheep and the Lost Drachma Have No Suitable Application to the Christ of Marcion.</h2>

<p>Who sought after the lost sheep and the lost piece of silver? <span class="stiki" id="note034767"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;15:1-10</a></span> Was it not the loser? But who was the loser? Was it not he who once possessed  them? Who, then, was that? Was it not he to whom they belonged?  Since, then, <em>man</em> is the property of none other than the Creator, He possessed Him who owned him; He lost him who once possessed him; He sought him who lost him; He found him who sought him; He rejoiced who found him. Therefore the purport  of neither <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> has anything whatever to do with him  to whom belongs neither the sheep nor the piece of silver, that is to say, <em>man</em>. For he lost him not, because he possessed him not; and he sought him not, because he lost him not; and he found him not, because he sought him not; and he rejoiced not, because he found him not. Therefore, to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over the sinner's repentance&mdash; that is, at the recovery of lost man&mdash; is the attribute of Him who long ago professed that He would rather that the sinner should repent and not die.</p>

One Only God, the Creator, by His Own Will Changed the Dispensations. No New God Had a Hand in the Change.</h2>

<p>What the two masters are who, He says, cannot be served, <span class="stiki" id="note034772"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;16:13</a></span> on the ground that while one is pleased  the other must needs be displeased,  He Himself makes clear, when He mentions God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>. Then, if you have no interpreter by you, you may learn again from Himself what He would have understood by <em><a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a></em>.  For when advising us to provide for ourselves the help of friends in worldly affairs, after the example of that steward who, when removed from his office,  relieves his lord's debtors by lessening their debts with a view to their recompensing him with their help, He said, <q>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the <em><a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a></em> of unrighteousness,</q> that is to say, of money, even as the steward had done. Now we are all of us aware that money is the instigator  of unrighteousness, and the lord of the whole world. Therefore, when he saw the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> doing servile worship  to it, He hurled  this sentence against them, <q>You cannot serve God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034780"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;16:13</a></span> Then the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who were <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> of riches, derided Him, when they understood that by <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> He meant money. Let no one think that under the word <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> the Creator was meant, and that Christ called them off from the service of the Creator. What <em>folly</em>! Rather learn therefrom that one God was pointed out by Christ. For they were two masters whom He named, God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>&mdash; the Creator and money. You cannot indeed serve God&mdash; Him, of course whom they seemed to serve&mdash; and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> to whom they preferred to devote themselves.  If, however, he was giving himself out as another <em>god</em>, it would not be two masters, but three, that he had pointed out. For the Creator was a master, and much more of a master, to be sure,  than <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, and more to be adored, as being more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> our Master. Now, how was it likely that He who had called <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> a master, and had associated him with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should say nothing of Him who was really the Master of even these, that is, the Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting Him did He concede that service might be rendered to <em>Him</em>, since it was to Himself alone and to <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> that He said service could not be (simultaneously) rendered? When, therefore, He lays down the position that God is one, since He would have been sure to mention  the Creator if He were Himself a rival  to Him, He did (virtually) name the Creator, when He refrained from insisting  that He was Master alone, without a rival god. Accordingly, this will throw light upon the sense in which it was said, <q>If you have not been faithful in the unrighteous <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, who will commit to your trust the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034786"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;16:11</a></span> <q>In the unrighteous <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>,</q> that is to say, in unrighteous riches, not in the Creator; for even <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> allows Him to be righteous: <q>And if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give to you that which is mine?</q>  For whatever is unrighteous ought to be foreign to the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But in what way was the Creator foreign to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, seeing that He was the proper God of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation? Forasmuch then as the words, <q>Who will entrust to you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> riches?</q> and, <q>Who will give you that which is mine?</q> are only suitable to the Creator and not to <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, He could not have uttered them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. He could only seem to have spoken them in this sense, if, when remarking  their unfaithfulness to the Creator and not to <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, He had drawn some distinctions between the Creator (in his manner of mentioning Him) and the rival god&mdash; how that the latter would not commit his own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to those who were unfaithful to the Creator. How then can he possibly seem to belong to another god, if He be not set forth, with the express intention of being separated  from the very thing which is in question. But when the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> <q>justified themselves before men,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034790"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;16:15</a></span> and placed their hope of reward in man, He censured them in the sense in which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah said, <q>Cursed is the man that trusts in man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034791"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5</a></span> Since the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> went on to say, <q>But the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> your hearts,</q>  he magnified the power of that God who declared Himself to be as a lamp, <q>searching the reins and the heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034793"><a href="../bible/jer020.htm#verse12">Jeremiah&nbsp;20:12</a></span> When He strikes at <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in the words: <q>That which is highly esteemed among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is abomination in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034794"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;16:15</a></span> He recalls Isaiah: <q>For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and lofty, and upon every one that is arrogant and lifted up, and they shall be brought low.</q>  I can now make out why <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god was for so long an age concealed. He was, I suppose, waiting until he had learned all these things from the Creator. He continued his pupillage up to the time of John, and then proceeded immediately to announce the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, saying: <q>The law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were until John; since that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034796"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;16:16</a></span> Just as if we also did not recognise in John a certain limit placed between the old dispensation and the new, at which <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> ceased and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> began&mdash; without, however, supposing that it was by the power of another god that there came about a cessation  of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the commencement of that gospel in which is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, Christ Himself. For although, as we have shown, the Creator foretold that the old state of things would pass away and a new state would succeed, yet, inasmuch as John is shown to be both the forerunner and the preparer of the ways of that Lord who was to introduce the gospel and publish the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, it follows from the very fact that John has come, that Christ must be that very Being who was to follow His harbinger John. So that, if the old course has ceased and the new has begun, with John intervening between them, there will be nothing wonderful in it, because it happens according to the purpose of the Creator; so that you may get a better <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for the kingdom of God from any quarter, however anomalous,  than from the conceit that the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> ended in John, and a new state of things began after him. <q>More easily, therefore, may heaven and earth pass away&mdash; as also the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; than that one tittle of the Lord's words should fail.</q>  <q>For,</q> as says Isaiah: <q>the word of our God shall stand for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034800"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;40:8</a></span> Since even <em>then</em> by Isaiah it was Christ, the Word and Spirit  of the Creator, who <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> described John as <q>the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034802"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;40:3</a></span> and as about to come for the purpose of terminating thenceforth the course of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; by their fulfilment and not their extinction, and in order that the kingdom of God might be announced by Christ, He therefore purposely added the assurance that the elements would more easily pass away than His words fail; affirming, as He did, the further fact, that what He had said concerning John had not fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>But Christ prohibits <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, saying, <q>Whosoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and whosoever marries her that is put away from her husband, also commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034803"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;16:18</a></span> In order to forbid <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, He makes it unlawful to marry a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that has been put away. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: <q>When a man has taken a wife, and has lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he has found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034804"><a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;24:1</a></span> You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel&mdash; between <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Christ?  To be sure there is!  But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.  There, while prohibiting <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> says He, <q>because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034808"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;19:8</a></span> &mdash; for this reason, indeed, because He who had <q>made them male and female</q> had likewise said, <q>They two shall become one flesh; what therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034809"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;19:4,&nbsp;6</a></span> Now, by this answer of His (to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>), He both sanctioned the provision of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose  the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, and yet at the same time represented  the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated  than abolished the enactment of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>; the case supposed being, that a man <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife for the express purpose of  marrying another. His words are: <q>Whosoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and whosoever marries her that is put away from her husband, also commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034814"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;16:18</a></span> &mdash; <q>put away,</q> that is, for the reason wherefore a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-<a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,  therefore, while matrimony is undissolved, is to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Since, therefore, His prohibition of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,  when there is an absence of the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why He gave His prohibition. In very deed  His teaching is not contrary to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whose precept He partially  defends, I will not  say confirms. If, however, you deny that <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side  destroy marriage, not uniting man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, nor admitting to the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,  unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>,  if his wife commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,  does not permit <q>the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034824"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:15</a></span> Divorce, therefore, when <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> deserved,  has even in Christ a defender. So that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Matthew he says, <q>Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication, causes her to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034826"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;5:32</a></span> He also is deemed equally guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, who marries a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in another passage enacting that he who had married after <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife. <span class="stiki" id="note034827"><a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse28">Deuteronomy&nbsp;22:28-29</a></span> Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> shall be permanent, how much rather shall a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>You shall not forsake the wife of your youth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034828"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse15">Malachi&nbsp;2:15</a></span> Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> and in forbidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have  now to show whence the Lord derived this decision  of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance  by any suddenly devised proposal of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,  when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,  seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband), <span class="stiki" id="note034834"><a href="../bible/deu025.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;25:5-6</a></span> and was in consequence cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and finally, by the same <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, was even <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure  against <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> in the form of unlawful marriages and of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>; who had been impelled thereto by his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law&mdash; for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> could not be lawful on that very account;  and who, when the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the rich man  tormented in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and the poor man resting in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom. <span class="stiki" id="note034838"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;16:19-31</a></span> For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally  fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.  It sets forth in bold outline  the end of both of them, the <q>torments</q> of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and the <q>comfort</q> of John, that even now <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> might hear that warning: <q>They have there <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, let them hear them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034842"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;16:29</a></span> <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life  for those who have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; while he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> itself which dazzles  his sight expressly distinguishes between <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. <q>Hell</q> (I take it) means one thing, and <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom</q> another. <q>A great gulf</q> is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have <q>lifted up his eyes,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034845"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;16:23</a></span> and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children, even from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (since he is <q>the father of many nations,</q> which must be classed among his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>), and of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as that wherewithal he himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without the yoke of the law and the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. This region, therefore, I call <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,  and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with the <q>full recompense of their reward.</q>  This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of <q>those stories towards heaven</q>  which Christ <q>builds</q>&mdash; of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, <q>Who shall declare unto you <em>the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> place</em>, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walks in righteousness, speaks of the straight path, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and iniquity?</q>  Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> shall be even as the stars of heaven, by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,  without any injury to that promise, that by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>  of both judgments? If so, you have here, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, during your present lifetime, a warning that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> declare one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> rest with Him, the one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says <em><a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a></em>, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but Christ; Hear Him <em>is the command</em>.  This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> enough. For the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had by that time sufficiently heard <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For even Peter would not have been able  to say, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034854"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;9:20</a></span> unless he had beforehand heard and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them <em>hear</em>  <em>Him</em>, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.  Down in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, however, it was said concerning them: <q>They have <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; let them hear them!</q>&mdash; even those who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them or at least did not sincerely  <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of luxury, announced indeed by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but decreed by that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raises up the poor from dunghills.  Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions <em>of reward and punishment</em>, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,  but only a difference in the actual matters  before us.</p>

<p>Then, turning to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He says: <q>Woe unto him through whom offenses come! It were better for him if he had not been born, or if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034860"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;17:1-2</a></span> that is, one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Judge, then, what the sort of punishment is which He so severely threatens. For it is no stranger who is to avenge the offense done to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Recognise also in Him the Judge, and one too, who expresses Himself on the safety of His followers with the same tenderness as that which the Creator long ago exhibited: <q>He that touches you touches the apple of my eye.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034861"><a href="../bible/zec002.htm#verse8">Zechariah&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Such identity of care proceeds from one and the same Being. A trespassing brother He will have rebuked. <span class="stiki" id="note034862"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;17:3</a></span> If one failed in this duty of reproof, he in fact <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, either because out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> he wished his brother to continue in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or else spared him from mistaken friendship,  although possessing the injunction in Leviticus: <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your brother in your heart; your neighbor you shall seriously rebuke, and on his account shall not contract <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  Nor is it to be wondered at, if <em>He</em> thus teaches who forbids your refusing to bring back even your brother's cattle, if you find them astray in the road; much more should you bring back your erring brother to himself. He commands you to forgive your brother, should he trespass against you even <q>seven times.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034865"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;17:4</a></span> But that surely, is a small matter; for with the Creator there is a larger <em><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></em>, when He sets no limits to forgiveness, indefinitely charging you <q>not to bear any <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> against your brother,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034866"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse18">Leviticus&nbsp;19:18</a></span> and to give not merely to him who asks, but even to him who does not ask. For His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is, not that you should forgive  an offense, but forget it. The law about <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> had a profound meaning as respects  the forms of the disease itself, and of the inspection by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.  The interpretation of this sense it will be our task to ascertain. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> labour, however, is to object to us the strictness  of the law, with the view of maintaining that here also Christ is its enemy&mdash; forestalling  its enactments even in His cure of the ten <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>. These He simply commanded to show themselves to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; <q>and as they went, He cleansed them</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034872"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;17:11-19</a></span> &mdash; without a touch, and without a word, by His silent power and simple will. Well, but what necessity was there for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who had been once for all announced as the healer of our sicknesses and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Himself such by His acts,  to busy Himself with inquiries  into the qualities <em>and details</em> of cures; or for the Creator to be summoned to the scrutiny of the law in the person of Christ? If any part of this healing was effected by Him in a way different from the law, He <em>yet</em> Himself did it to perfection; for surely the Lord may by Himself, or by His Son, produce after one manner, and after another manner by His servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, those <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of His power and might especially, which (as excelling in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and strength, because they are His own acts) rightly enough leave in the distance behind them the works which are done by His servants. But enough has been already said on this point in a former passage.  Now, although He said in a preceding chapter,  that <q>there were many <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the days of Eliseus the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian,</q> yet of course the mere number proves nothing towards a difference in the gods, as tending to the abasement  of the Creator in curing only one, and the pre-eminence of Him who healed ten. For who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that many might have been cured by Him who cured one more easily than ten by him who had never healed one before? But His main purpose in this declaration was to strike at the unbelief or the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in that (although there were many <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> among them, and a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was not wanting to them) not one had been moved even by so conspicuous an example to betake himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who was working in His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Forasmuch, then, as He was Himself the veritable  High Priest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He inspected them according to the hidden purport of the law, which signified that Christ was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> distinguisher and extinguisher of the defilements of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. However, what was obviously required by the law He commanded should be done: <q>Go,</q> said He, <q>show yourselves to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034879"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;17:14</a></span> Yet why this, if He meant to cleanse them first? Was it as a despiser of the law, in order to prove to them that, having been cured already on the road, the law was now nothing to them, nor even the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>? Well, the matter must of course pass as it best may,  if anybody supposes that Christ had such views as these!  But there are certainly better interpretations to be found of the passage, and more deserving of belief: how that they were cleansed on this account, because  they were <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, and went as the law required, when they were commanded to go to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and it is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who observed the law could have found a cure from a god that was destroying the law. Why, however, did He not give such a command to the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> who first returned?  Because Elisha did not in the case of Naaman the Syrian, and yet was not on that account less the Creator's agent? This is a sufficient answer. But the believer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that there is a profounder reason. Consider, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> motives.  The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was performed in the district of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, to which country also belonged one of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note034885"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;17:17</a></span> <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, however, had revolted from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, carrying with it the disaffected nine tribes,  which, having been alienated  by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ahijah,  <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a> settled in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. Besides, the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> were always pleased with the mountains and the wells of their ancestors. Thus, in the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, when conversing with the Lord at the well, says, <q>No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>  You are greater,</q> etc.; and again, <q>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; but you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</q>  Accordingly, He who said, <q>Woe unto them that trust in the mountain of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034891"><a href="../bible/amo006.htm#verse1">Amos&nbsp;6:1</a></span> vouchsafing now to restore that very region, purposely requests the men <q>to go and show themselves to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>,</q> because these were to be found only there where the temple was; submitting  the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> to the Jew, inasmuch as <q><a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034893"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;4:22</a></span> whether to the Israelite or the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, indeed, wholly appertained the promised Christ,  in order that men might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that at Jerusalem were both the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the temple; that there also was the womb  of religion, and its <em>living</em> fountain, not its <em>mere</em> <q>well.</q>  Seeing, therefore, that they recognised  the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that at Jerusalem the law was to be fulfilled, He healed them, whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was to come  of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <span class="stiki" id="note034899"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;17:19</a></span> without the ceremony of the law. Whence also, astonished that one only out of the ten was thankful for his release to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, He does not command him to offer a gift according to the law, because he had already paid his tribute of gratitude when <q>he <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God</q>; <span class="stiki" id="note034900"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;17:15</a></span> for thus did the Lord will that the law's requirement should be interpreted. And yet who was the God to whom the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> gave thanks, because thus far not even had an Israelite heard of another god? Who else but He by whom all had hitherto been healed through Christ? And therefore it was said to him, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has made you whole,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034901"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;17:19</a></span> because he had discovered that it was his duty to render the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> oblation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>&mdash; even thanksgiving&mdash; in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> temple, and before His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> High Priest <em>Jesus</em> Christ. But it is impossible either that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> should seem to have inquired of the Lord about the coming of the kingdom of the rival god, when no other god has ever yet been announced by Christ; or that He should have answered them concerning the kingdom of any other god than Him of whom they were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of asking Him. <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> He says, <q>comes not with observation; neither do they say, Lo here! Or, lo there! For, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034902"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;17:20-21</a></span> Now, who will not interpret the words <q> <em>within you</em></q> to mean <em>in your hand, within your power</em>, if you hear, and do the commandment of God? If, however, the kingdom of God lies in His commandment, set before your mind <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> on the other side, according to our <em>antitheses</em>, and you will find the self-same view of the case.  <q>The commandment is not a lofty one,  neither is it far off from you. It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?' nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?' But the word is very near unto you, in your mouth, and in your heart, and in your hands, to do it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034905"><a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy&nbsp;30:11-13</a></span> This means, <q>Neither in this place nor that place is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; for, behold, it is within you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034906"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;17:21</a></span> And if the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, in their audacity, should contend that the Lord did not give an answer about His own kingdom, but only about the Creator's kingdom, concerning which they had inquired, then the following words are against them. For He tells them that <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must suffer many things, and be rejected,</q> before His coming, <span class="stiki" id="note034907"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;17:25</a></span> at which His kingdom will be really  revealed. In this statement He shows that it was His own kingdom which His answer to them had contemplated, and which was now awaiting His own sufferings and rejection. But having to be rejected and afterwards to be acknowledged, and taken up  and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, He borrowed the very word <q>rejected</q> from the passage, where, under the figure of <em>a stone</em>, His twofold manifestation was celebrated by David&mdash; the first in rejection, the second in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: <q>The stone,</q> says He, <q>which the builders rejected, has become the head-stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing.</q>  Now it would be idle, if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that God had predicted the humiliation, or even the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, of any <em>Christ</em> at all, that He could have signed His <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> for any but Him whom He had foretold under the figure of a <em>stone</em>, and a <em>rock</em>, and a <em>mountain</em>.  If, however, He speaks of His own coming, why does He compare it with the days of Noe and of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note034912"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;17:26-30</a></span> which were dark and terrible&mdash; a mild and gentle God as He is? Why does He bid us <q>remember <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034913"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;17:32</a></span> who despised the Creator's command, and was punished for her contempt, if He does not come with judgment to avenge the infraction of His precepts? If He really does punish, like the Creator,  if He is my Judge, He ought not to have adduced examples for the purpose of instructing me from Him whom He yet destroys, that <em>He</em>  might not seem to be my instructor. But if He does not even here speak of His own coming, but of the coming of the Hebrew Christ,  let us still wait in expectation that He will vouchsafe to us some <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of His own advent; meanwhile we will continue to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is none other than He whom He reminds us of in every passage.</p>

<p>When He recommends perseverance and earnestness in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, He sets before us the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the judge who was compelled to listen to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, owing to the earnestness and importunity of her requests. <span class="stiki" id="note034917"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;18:1-8</a></span> He show us that it is God the judge whom we must importune with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and not Himself, if He is not Himself the judge. But He added, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would avenge His own elect.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034918"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;18:7-8</a></span> Since, then, He who judges will also Himself be the avenger, He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the Creator is on that account the specially good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  whom He represented as the avenger of His own elect, who cry day and night to Him. And yet, when He introduces <em>to our view</em> the Creator's temple, and describes two men worshipping therein with diverse feelings&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> in humility&mdash; and shows us how they accordingly went down to their homes, one rejected,  the other justified, <span class="stiki" id="note034921"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;18:10-14</a></span> He surely, by thus teaching us the proper discipline of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, has determined that that God must be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to from whom men were to receive this discipline of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>&mdash; whether condemnatory of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, or justifying in humility.  I do not find from Christ any temple, any suppliants, any sentence (of approval or condemnation) belonging to any other god than the Creator. Him does He enjoin us to worship in humility, as the lifter-up of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, not in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, because He brings down  the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. What other god has He manifested to me to receive my supplications? With what formula of worship, with what hope (shall I approach him?) I trow, none. For the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which He has taught us suits, as we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>,  none but the Creator. It is, of course, another matter if He does not wish to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to, because He is the supremely and spontaneously good God! But who is this good God? There is, He says, <q>none but one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034925"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;18:19</a></span> It is not as if He had shown us that one of two gods was the supremely good; but He expressly asserts that there is one only good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the only good, because He is the only God. Now, undoubtedly,  He is the good God who <q>sends rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034927"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> sustaining and nourishing and assisting even Marcionites themselves! When afterwards <q>a certain man asked him, 'Good Master, what shall I do to inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life?'</q> (Jesus) inquired whether he <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a></em> (that is, in other words, whether he <em>kept</em>) the commandments of the Creator, in order to testify  that it was by the Creator's precepts that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life is acquired. <span class="stiki" id="note034929"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;18:18-20</a></span> Then, when he affirmed that from his youth up he had kept all the principal commandments, (Jesus) said to him: <q>One thing you yet lack: sell all that you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034930"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;18:21-22</a></span> Well now, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and all you who are companions in misery, and associates in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>  with that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, what will you dare say to this? Did Christ rescind the forementioned commandments: <q>Do not kill, Do not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, Do not steal, Do not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, Honour your father and your mother?</q> Or did He both keep them, and then add  what was wanting to them? This very precept, however, about giving to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, was very largely  diffused through the pages of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. This vainglorious observer of the commandments was therefore convicted  of holding money in much higher estimation (than charity). This verity of the gospel then stands unimpaired: <q>I am not come to destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but rather to fulfil them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034935"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> He also dissipated other doubts, when He declared that the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the Good belonged to one and the same being, at whose disposal were also the everlasting life and the treasure in heaven and Himself too&mdash; whose commandments He both maintained and augmented with His own supplementary precepts. He may likewise be discovered in the following passage of Micah, saying: <q>He has showed you, O man, what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and what does the Lord require of you, but to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> mercy, and to be ready to follow the Lord your God?</q>  Now Christ is the man who tells us what is <em>good</em>, even the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the law. <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> says He, <q>the commandments.</q> <q>To do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a></q>&mdash; <q>Sell all that you have;</q> <q>to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> mercy</q>&mdash; <q>Give to the poor:</q> <q>and to be ready to walk with God</q>&mdash; <q>And come,</q> says He, <q>follow me.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation was from its beginning so carefully divided into tribes and clans, and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and houses, that no man could very well have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his descent&mdash; even from the recent assessments of Augustus, which were still probably extant at this time.  But the Jesus of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> (although there could be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of a person's having been born, who was seen to be a man), as being unborn, could not, of course, have possessed any public testimonial  of his descent, but was to be regarded as one of that obscure class of whom nothing was in any way <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Why then did the blind man, on hearing that He was passing by, exclaim, <q>Jesus, You Son of David, have mercy on me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034940"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;18:38</a></span> unless he was considered, in no uncertain manner,  to be the Son of David (in other words, to belong to David's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>) through his mother and his brethren, who at some time or other had been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him by public notoriety? <q>Those, however, who went before rebuked the blind man, that he should hold his peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034942"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;18:39</a></span> And properly enough; because he was very noisy, not because he was wrong about the son of David. Else you must show me, that those who rebuked him were aware that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not the Son of David, in order that they may be supposed to have had this reason for imposing silence on the blind man. But even if you could show me this, still (the blind man) would more readily have presumed that they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, than that the Lord could possibly have permitted an untrue exclamation about Himself. But the Lord <q>stood patient.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034943"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;18:40</a></span> Yes; but not as confirming the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, for, on the contrary, He rather displayed the Creator. Surely He could not have first removed this man's blindness, in order that he might afterwards cease to regard Him as the Son of David! However,  that you may not <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>  His patience, nor fasten on Him any charge of dissimulation, nor deny Him to be the Son of David, He very pointedly confirmed the exclamation of the blind man&mdash; both by the actual gift of healing, and by bearing testimony to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> say Christ, <q>has made you whole.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034946"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;18:42</a></span> What would you have the blind man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to have been? That Jesus was descended from that (alien) god (of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>), to subvert the Creator and overthrow the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? That He was not the destined offshoot from the root of Jesse, and the fruit of David's loins, the restorer  also of the blind? But I apprehend there were at that time no such stone-blind <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, that an opinion like this could have constituted the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the blind man, and have induced him to confide in the mere <em>name</em>,  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Son of David. He, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all this of Himself,  and wished others to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it also, endowed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this man&mdash; although it was already gifted with a better sight, and although it was in possession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light&mdash; with the external vision likewise, in order that we too might learn the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and at the same time find its recompense. Whosoever wishes to see Jesus the Son of David must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him; through the Virgin's birth.  He who will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this will not hear from Him the salutation, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you.</q> And so he will remain blind, falling into <em>Antithesis</em> after <em>Antithesis</em>, which mutually destroy each other,  just as <q>the blind man leads the blind down into the ditch.</q>  For (here is one of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> <em>Antitheses</em>): whereas David in old time, in the capture of Sion, was offended by the blind who opposed his admission (into the stronghold) &mdash; in which respect (I should rather say) that they were a type of people equally blind,  who in after-times would not admit Christ to be the son of David&mdash; so, on the contrary, Christ succoured the blind man, to show by this act that He was not David's son, and how different in disposition He was, kind to the blind, while David ordered them to be slain.  If all this were so, why did <em><a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a></em> allege that the blind man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was of so worthless  a stamp? The fact is,  the Son of David so acted,  that the <em>Antithesis</em> must lose its point by its own absurdity.  Those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who offended David were blind, and the man who now presents himself as a suppliant to David's son is afflicted with the same infirmity.  Therefore the Son of David was appeased with some sort of satisfaction by the blind man when He restored him to sight, and added His approval of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which had led him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that he must win to his help  the Son of David by earnest entreaty. But, after all, I suspect that it was the audacity (of the old Jebusites) which offended David, and not their malady.</p>

<p><q>Salvation comes to the house</q> of Zacch&aelig;us  even. <span class="stiki" id="note034962"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;19:9</a></span> For what reason? Was it because he also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that Christ came by <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>? But the blind man's cry was still sounding in the ears of all: <q>Jesus, You Son of David, have mercy on me.</q> And <q>all the people gave praise unto God</q>&mdash; not <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a>, but David's. Now, although Zacch&aelig;us was probably a Gentile,  he yet from his intercourse with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had obtained a smattering  of their Scriptures, and, more than this, had, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, fulfilled the precepts of Isaiah: <q>Deal your bread,</q> said the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>to the hungry, and bring the poor that are cast out into your house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034965"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;58:7</a></span> This he did in the best possible way, by receiving the Lord, and entertaining Him in his house. <q>When you see the naked cover him.</q>  This he promised to do, in an equally satisfactory way, when he offered the half of his goods for all works of mercy.  So also <q>he loosened the bands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, undid the heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free, and broke every yoke,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034968"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;58:6</a></span> when he said, <q>If I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034969"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;19:8</a></span> Therefore the Lord said, <q>This day is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> come to this house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034970"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;19:9</a></span> Thus did He give His testimony, that the precepts of the Creator spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> tended to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  But when He adds, <q>For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has come to seek and to save that which was lost,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034972"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span> my present contention is not whether <em>He</em> had come to save what was lost, <em>to whom</em> it had once belonged, and <em>from whom</em> what He came to save had fallen away; but I approach a different question. <em>Man</em>, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of it, is here the subject of consideration. Now, since he consists of two parts,  body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the point to be inquired into is, in which of these two man would seem to have been lost? If in his body, then it is his body, not his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is lost. What, however, is lost, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> saves. The body,  therefore, has the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. If, (on the other hand,) it is in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that man is lost, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is designed for the lost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and the body which is not lost is safe. If, (to take the only other supposition,) man is wholly lost, in both his natures, then it necessarily follows that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is appointed for the entire man; and then the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is shivered to pieces,  who say that there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the flesh. And this affords a confirmation that Christ belongs to the Creator, who followed the Creator in promising the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole man. The <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> also of the (ten) servants, who received their several recompenses according to the manner in which they had increased their lord's money by trading  proves Him to be a God of judgment&mdash; even a God who, in strict account,  not only bestows <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but also takes away what a man seems to have.  Else, if it is the Creator whom He has here delineated as the <q>austere man,</q> who <q>takes up what he laid not down, and reaps what he did not sow,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034979"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;19:22</a></span> my instructor even here is He, (whoever He may be,) to whom belongs the money He teaches me fruitfully to expend. </p>

<p>Christ <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <q>the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, whence it was.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034981"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;20:4</a></span> Then why did He ask them, as if He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not? He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> would not give Him an answer; then why did He ask in vain? Was it that He might judge them out of their own mouth, or their own heart? Suppose you refer these points to an excuse of the Creator, or to <em>His</em> comparison with Christ; then consider what would have happened if the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> had replied to His question. Suppose their answer to have been, that John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was <q>of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> they would have been immediately <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note034982"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;20:6</a></span> Some <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, in rivalry to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, would have stood up  and said: O most excellent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; how different are his ways from the Creator's! <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that men would rush down headlong over it, He placed them actually  on the very precipice. For thus do men treat of the Creator respecting His law of the tree.  But John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was <q>from heaven.</q> <q>Why, therefore,</q> asks Christ, <q>did you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034986"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;20:5</a></span> He therefore who had wished men to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> John, purposing to censure  them because they had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him, belonged to Him whose sacrament John was administering. But, at any rate,  when He actually met their refusal to say what they thought, with such reprisals as, <q>Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034989"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;20:8</a></span> He returned <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>! <q>Render unto C&aelig;sar the things which be C&aelig;sar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034990"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;20:25</a></span> What will be <q>the things which are God's?</q> Such things as are like C&aelig;sar's <em>denarius</em>&mdash; that is to say, His image and similitude. That, therefore, which he commands to be <q>rendered unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> the Creator, is <em>man</em>, who has been stamped with His image, likeness, name, and substance.  Let <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god look after his own mint.  Christ bids the <em>denarius</em> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> imprint to be rendered to His C&aelig;sar, (His C&aelig;sar I say,) not the C&aelig;sar of a strange god.  The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however, must be confessed, this god has not a <em>denarius</em> to call his own! In every question the just and proper rule is, that the meaning of the answer ought to be adapted to the proposed inquiry. But it is nothing short of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to return an answer altogether different from the question submitted to you. God forbid, then, that we should expect from Christ  conduct which would be unfit even to an ordinary man! The <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who said there was no resurrection, in a discussion on that subject, had proposed to the Lord a case of law touching a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who, in accordance with the legal prescription, had been married to seven brothers who had died one after the other. The question therefore was, to which husband must she be reckoned to belong in the resurrection? <span class="stiki" id="note034995"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;20:27-33</a></span> This, (observe,) was the gist of the inquiry, this was the sum and substance of the dispute. And to it Christ was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return a direct answer. He had nobody to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; that it should seem advisable  for Him either to evade their questions, or to make them the occasion of indirectly mooting  a subject which He was not in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of teaching publicly at any other time. He therefore gave His answer, that <q>the children of this world marry.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034998"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;20:34</a></span> You see how pertinent it was to the case in point. Because the question concerned the next world, and He was going to declare that no one marries there, He opens the way by laying down the principles that here, where there is death, there is also marriage. <q>But they whom God shall account worthy of the possession of that world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; forasmuch as they cannot die any more, since they become equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, being made the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the resurrection.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note034999"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;20:35-36</a></span> If, then, the meaning of the answer must not turn on any other point than on the proposed question, and since the question proposed is fully understood from this sense of the answer,  then the Lord's reply admits of no other interpretation than that by which the question is clearly understood.  You have both the time in which marriage is permitted, and the time in which it is said to be unsuitable, laid before you, not on their own account, but in consequence of an inquiry about the resurrection. You have likewise a confirmation of the resurrection itself, and the whole question which the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> mooted, who asked no question about another god, nor inquired about the proper law of marriage. Now, if you make Christ answer questions which were not submitted to Him, you, in fact, represent Him as having been unable to solve the points on which He was really consulted, and entrapped of course by the cunning of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>. I shall now proceed, by way of supererogation,  and after the rule (I have laid down about questions and answers),  to deal with the arguments which have any consistency in them.  They procured then a copy of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, and made short work with its text, by reading it thus:  <q>Those whom <em>the god of that world</em> shall account worthy.</q> They add the phrase <q> <em>of that world</em></q> to the word <q> <em>god</em>,</q> whereby they make another god <q>the god of that world;</q> whereas the passage ought to be read thus: <q>Those whom God shall account worthy of the possession of that world</q> (removing the distinguishing phrase <q> <em>of this world</em></q> to the end of the clause,  in other words, <q>Those whom God shall account worthy of obtaining and rising to that world.</q> For the question submitted to Christ had nothing to do with <em>the god</em>, but only with <em>the state</em>, of that world. It was: <q>Whose wife should this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be in that world after the resurrection?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035007"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;20:33</a></span> They thus subvert His answer respecting the essential question of marriage, and apply His words, <q>The children of this world marry and are given in marriage,</q> as if they referred to the Creator's men, and His permission to them to marry; while they themselves whom the god of that world&mdash; that is, the rival god&mdash; accounted worthy of the resurrection, do not marry even here, because they are not children of this world. But the fact is, that, having been consulted about marriage in <em>that</em> world, not in this present one, He had simply declared the non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of that to which the question related. They, indeed, who had caught the very force of His voice, and pronunciation, and expression, discovered no other sense than what had reference to the matter of the question. Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> exclaimed, <q>Master, You have well said.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035008"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;20:39</a></span> For He had affirmed the resurrection, by describing the form  thereof in opposition to the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>. Now, He did not reject the attestation of those who had assumed His answer to bear this meaning. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> thought Christ was David's Son, whereas (David) himself calls Him Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note035010"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;20:41-44</a></span> what relation has this to Christ? David did not literally confute  an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, yet David asserted the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when he more prominently affirmed that He was his Lord than his Son,&mdash; an attribute which was hardly suitable to the destroyer of the Creator. But how consistent is the interpretation on our side of the question! For He, who had been a little while ago invoked by the blind man as <q>the Son of David,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035012"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;18:38</a></span> then made no remark on the subject, not having the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> in His presence; whereas He now purposely moots the point before them, and <em>that</em> of His own accord, <span class="stiki" id="note035013"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;20:41</a></span> in order that He might show Himself whom the blind man, following the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, had simply declared to be the Son of David, to be also his Lord. He thus honoured the blind man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which had acknowledged His Sonship to David; but at the same time He struck a blow at the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, which prevented them from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He was also (David's) Lord. Whatever had relation to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Creator's Christ, no other would thus guard and maintain  but Himself the Creator's Christ.</p>

<p>As touching the propriety of His names, it has already been seen  that both of them  are suitable to Him who was the first both to announce His <em>Christ</em> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and to give Him the further name  of <em>Jesus</em>. The impudence, therefore, of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ will be evident, when he says that many will come in his name, whereas this name does not at all belong to <em>him</em>, since he is not the Christ and Jesus of the Creator, to whom these names do properly appertain; and more especially when he prohibits those to be received whose very equal in imposture he is, inasmuch as he (equally with them ) comes in a name which belongs to another&mdash; unless it was his business to warn off from a mendaciously assumed name the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (of One) who, by reason of His name being properly given to Him, possessed also the verity thereof.

Christ, however, comes in His own name. What will you do, then, when He Himself comes who is the very Proprietor of these names, the Creator's Christ and Jesus? Will you reject Him? But how iniquitous, how <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and disrespectful to the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you should not receive Him who comes in His own name, when you have received another in His name! Now, let us see what are the signs which He ascribes to the times. <q>Wars,</q> I observe, <q>and kingdom against kingdom, and nation against nation, and pestilence, and famines, and earthquakes, and fearful sights, and great signs from heaven</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035021"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;21:9-11</a></span> &mdash; all which things are suitable for a severe and terrible God. Now, when He goes on to say that <q>all these things must needs come to pass,</q>  what does He represent Himself to be? The Destroyer, or the Defender of the Creator? For He affirms that these appointments of His must fully come to pass; but surely as the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He would have frustrated rather than advanced events so sad and terrible, if they had not been His own (decrees). <q>But before all these,</q> He foretells that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and sufferings were to come upon them, which indeed were <q>to turn for a testimony to them,</q> and for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  Hear what is predicted in Zechariah: <q>The Lord of hosts  shall protect them; and they shall devour them, and subdue them with sling-stones; and they shall drink their blood like wine, and they shall fill the bowls as it were of the altar. And the Lord shall save them in that day, even His people, like sheep; because as sacred stones they roll,</q>  etc. And that you may not suppose that these predictions refer to such sufferings as await them from so many <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with strangers,  consider the nature (of the sufferings). In a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which were to be waged with legitimate arms, no one would think of enumerating stones as weapons, which are better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in popular crowds and unarmed tumults. Nobody measures the copious streams of blood which flow in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> by bowlfuls, nor limits it to what is shed upon a single altar. No one gives the name of sheep to those who fall in battle with arms in hand, and while repelling force with force, but only to those who are slain, yielding themselves up in their own place of duty and with patience, rather than fighting in self-defence. In short, as he says, <q>they roll as sacred stones,</q> and not like soldiers fight. Stones are they, even foundation stones, upon which we are ourselves edified&mdash; <q>built,</q> as St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>upon the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035027"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse20">Ephesians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> who, like <q><a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> stones,</q> were rolled up and down exposed to the attack of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And therefore in this passage He forbids men <q>to meditate before what they answer</q> when brought before tribunals, <span class="stiki" id="note035028"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;21:12-14</a></span> even as once He suggested to Balaam the message which he had not thought of, <span class="stiki" id="note035029"><a href="../bible/num022.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xxii.-xxiv</a></span> nay, contrary to what he had thought; and promised <q>a mouth</q> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when he pleaded in excuse the slowness of his speech, <span class="stiki" id="note035030"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;4:10-12</a></span> and that wisdom which, by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, He showed to be irresistible: <q>One shall say, I am the Lord's, and shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe himself by the name of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035031"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;44:5</a></span> Now, what plea is wiser and more irresistible than the simple and open  confession made in a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, who <q>prevails with God</q>&mdash; which is what <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q> means?  Now, one cannot wonder that He forbade <q>premeditation,</q> who actually Himself received from the Father the ability of uttering words in season: <q>The Lord has given to me the tongue of the learned, that I should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to speak a word in season (to him that is weary);</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035034"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;50:4</a></span> except that <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> introduces to us a Christ who is not subject to the Father. That <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> from one's nearest friends are predicted, and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to His name, <span class="stiki" id="note035035"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;21:16-17</a></span> I need not again refer to.

<p>That <q>the very powers also of heaven have to be shaken,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035042"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;21:26</a></span> you may find in Joel: <q>And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth&mdash; blood and fire, and pillars of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035043"><a href="../bible/joe003.htm#verse30">Joel&nbsp;3:30-31</a></span> In Habakkuk also you have this statement: <q>With rivers shall the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see you, and be in pangs.

Since, therefore, these descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those of the great catastrophes, on the other&mdash; both in the predictions of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the declarations of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any distinction between them, as if the catastrophes could be referred to the Creator, as the terrible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being such as the good god (of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>) ought not to permit, much less expect&mdash; while the promises should be ascribed to the good god, being such as the Creator, in His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the said god, could not have predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they differ in no respect from the promises of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, He will be a match in the freeness of His gifts with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have been promised by your Christ than by my <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. (If you examine) the whole passage of this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> Scripture, from the inquiry of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>  down to the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the fig-tree <span class="stiki" id="note035056"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;21:33</a></span> you will find the sense in its connection suit in every point the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, so that it consistently ascribes to Him both the sorrows and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate them from Him in either respect. For as much, then, as there is but one <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow that to that one <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> belong both the judgments upon the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is (the advent) of <em>my Christ</em>, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you will have it that it is the coming of <em>your Christ</em>, then, when you ascribe to him the blessings which are to be the result of his advent, you are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to impute to him likewise the infliction of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which precede his appearance. For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which precede, and the blessings which immediately follow, the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, are both alike indissolubly connected with that event. Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make either the Creator a most beneficent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or else your own god terrible in his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>: <q>Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that summer is at hand. So likewise you, when you see these things come to pass, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the kingdom of God is very near.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035057"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;21:29-31</a></span> Now, if the fructification of the common trees  be an antecedent sign of the approach of summer, so in like manner do the great conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that kingdom which they precede. But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it is the sign; and to everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If, therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, therefore He did not destroy the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He further declares, <q>that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035059"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;21:33</a></span> What things, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, are these? Are they the things which the Creator made? Then the elements will tractably endure the accomplishment of their Maker's dispensation. If, however, they emanate from your excellent god, I much <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether  the heaven and earth will peaceably allow the completion of things which their Creator's enemy has determined! If the Creator quietly submits to this, then He is no <q>jealous God.</q> But let heaven and earth pass away, since their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And so Isaiah predicted that it should. <span class="stiki" id="note035061"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;40:8</a></span> Let the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also be warned, <q>lest their hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and cares of this world; and so that day come upon them unawares, like a snare</q> &mdash; if indeed they should forget God amidst the abundance and occupation of the world. Like this will be found the admonition of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>&mdash;so that He who delivers from <q>the snare</q> of that day is none other than He who so long before addressed to men the same admonition. <span class="stiki" id="note035063"><a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;8:12-14</a></span> Some places there were in Jerusalem where to teach; other places outside Jerusalem whither to retire <span class="stiki" id="note035064"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;21:37</a></span> &mdash; <q>in the day-time He was teaching in the temple;</q> just as He had foretold by Hosea: <q>In my house did they find me, and there did I speak with them.</q>  <q>But at night He went out to the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>.</q> For thus had Zechariah pointed out: <q>And His feet shall stand in that day on the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035066"><a href="../bible/zec014.htm#verse4">Zechariah&nbsp;14:4</a></span> Fit hours for an audience there also were. <q>Early in the morning</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035067"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;21:38</a></span> must they resort to Him, who (having said by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, <q>The Lord gives me the tongue of the learned</q>) added, <q>He has appointed me the morning, and has also given me an ear to hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035068"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;50:4</a></span> Now if this is to <em>destroy</em> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,  what will it be to <em>fulfil</em> them?</p>

<p>In like manner does He also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the very time it behooved Him to suffer, since the law prefigures His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. Accordingly, of all the festal days of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> He chose the passover. <span class="stiki" id="note035070"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm">Luke&nbsp;22:i</a></span> In this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had declared that there was a sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>:  <q>It is the Lord's passover.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035072"><a href="../bible/lev023.htm#verse5">Leviticus&nbsp;23:5</a></span> How earnestly, therefore, does He manifest the bent of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: <q>With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035073"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;22:15</a></span> What a destroyer of the law was this, who actually longed to keep its passover! Could it be that He was so fond of Jewish lamb?  But was it not because He had to be <q>led like a lamb to the slaughter; and because, as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so was He not to open His mouth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035075"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> that He so profoundly wished to accomplish the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of His own redeeming blood? He might also have been betrayed by any stranger, did I not find that even here too He fulfilled a Psalm: <q>He who ate bread with me has lifted up  his heel against me.</q>  And without a price might He have been betrayed. For what need of a traitor was there in the case of one who offered Himself to the people openly, and might quite as easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have been well enough for another Christ, but would not have been suitable in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written, <q>The righteous one did they sell for silver.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035078"><a href="../bible/amo002.htm#verse6">Amos&nbsp;2:6</a></span> The very amount and the destination  of the money, which on Judas' remorse was recalled <em>from its first purpose of a fee</em>,  and appropriated to the purchase of a potter's field, as narrated in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Matthew, were clearly foretold by Jeremiah:  <q>And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued  and gave them for the potter's field.</q> When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it <em>His own</em> feast; for it would have been unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then, having taken the bread and given it to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He made it His own body, by saying, <q>This is my body,</q>  that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body.  An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> might say,) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us. It would contribute very well to the support of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> theory of a phantom body,  that bread should have been crucified! But why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible thing, say) a melon,  which <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand how ancient was this figure of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who said Himself by Jeremiah: <q>I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that  they devised a device against me, saying, <em>Let us cast the tree upon His bread</em>,</q>  which means, of course, the cross upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He always did, upon the ancient prophecies,  He declared plainly enough what He meant by the <em>bread</em>, when He called the bread His own body. He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the <em>new</em> testament to be sealed <q>in His blood,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035090"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;22:20</a></span> affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not <em>a body</em> of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of the flesh, we get a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the body, and a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the flesh from the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, <q>Who is this that comes from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in His apparel, in the greatness of his might? Why are your garments red, and your raiment as his who comes from the treading of the full winepress?</q>  The prophetic Spirit contemplates the Lord as if He were already on His way to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, clad in His fleshly nature; and as He was to suffer therein, He represents the bleeding condition of His flesh under the metaphor of garments dyed in red, as if reddened in the treading and crushing process of the wine-press, from which the labourers descend reddened with the wine-juice, like men stained in blood. Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell this, when (in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch,  saying, <q>He washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035093"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;49:11</a></span> &mdash; in His garments and clothes the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine. Thus did He now consecrate His blood in wine, who then (by the patriarch) used the figure of wine to describe His blood.</p>

<p><q>Woe,</q> says He, <q>to that man by whom the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is betrayed!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035094"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;22:22</a></span> Now it is certain that in this <em>woe</em> must be understood the imprecation and threat of an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and incensed Master, unless Judas was to escape with impunity after so vast a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If he were meant to escape with impunity, the <em><q>woe</q></em> was an idle word; if not, he was of course to be punished by Him against whom he had committed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of treachery. Now, if He knowingly permitted the man, whom He  deliberately elected to be one of His companions, to plunge into so great a crime, you must no longer use an argument against the Creator in Adam's case, which may now recoil on your own God:  either that he was <em><a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a></em>, and had no foresight to hinder the future sinner;  or that he was <em>unable</em> to hinder him, even if he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>;  or else that he was <em>unwilling</em>, even if he had the foreknowledge and the ability; and so deserved the stigma of maliciousness, in having permitted the man of his own choice to perish in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. I advise you therefore (willingly) to acknowledge the Creator in that god of yours, rather than against your will to be assimilating your excellent god to Him. For in the case of Peter,  too, he gives you <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that he is a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he destined the apostle, after his presumptuous protestations of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, to a flat denial of him, rather than <em>prevent his fall</em>.  The Christ of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was destined, moreover, to be betrayed with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note035101"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;22:47-49</a></span> for He was the Son indeed of Him who was <q>honoured <em>with the lips</em></q> by the people. <span class="stiki" id="note035102"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> When led before the council, He is asked whether He is the Christ. <span class="stiki" id="note035103"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse66">Luke&nbsp;22:66-67</a></span> Of what Christ could the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have inquired  but their own? Why, therefore, did He not, even at that moment, declare to them the rival (Christ)? You reply, In order that He might be able to suffer. In other words, that this most excellent god might plunge men into crime, whom he was still keeping in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But even if he had told them, he would yet have to suffer. For he said, <q>If I tell you, you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035105"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse67">Luke&nbsp;22:67</a></span> And refusing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, they would have continued to insist on his death. And would he not even more probably still have had to suffer, if had announced himself as sent by the rival god, and as being, therefore, the enemy of the Creator? It was not, then, in order that He might suffer, that He at that critical moment refrained from proclaiming  Himself the other <em>Christ</em>, but because they wanted to extort a confession from His mouth, which they did not mean to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> even if He had given it to them, whereas it was their bounden duty to have acknowledged Him in consequence of His works, which were fulfilling their Scriptures. It was thus plainly His course to keep Himself at that moment unrevealed,  because a spontaneous recognition was due to Him. But yet for all this, He with a solemn gesture  says, <q>Hereafter shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> sit on the right hand of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035109"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse69">Luke&nbsp;22:69</a></span> For it was on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Daniel that He intimated to them that He was <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035110"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13</a></span> and of David's Psalm, that He would <q>sit at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Accordingly, after He had said this, and so suggested a comparison of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, a ray of light did seem to show them whom He would have them understand Him to be; for they say: <q>Are you then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035112"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse70">Luke&nbsp;22:70</a></span> Of what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but of Him whom alone they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>? Of what God but of Him whom they remembered in the Psalm as having said to His Son, <q>Sit on my right hand?</q> Then He answered, <q>You say that I am;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035113"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse70">Luke&nbsp;22:70</a></span> as if He meant: It is <em>you</em> who say this&mdash; not I. But at the same time He allowed Himself to be all that they had said, in this their second question.  By what means, however, are you going to prove to us that they pronounced the sentence <q> <em>Ergo tu filius Dei es</em></q> interrogatively, and not affirmatively?  Just as, (on the one hand,) because He had shown them in an indirect manner,  by passages of Scripture, that they ought to regard Him as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, they therefore meant their own words, <q>You are then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> to be taken in a like (indirect) sense,  as much as to say, <q>You do not wish to say this of yourself plainly,</q>  so, (on the other hand,) He likewise answered them, <q>You say that I am,</q> in a sense equally free from <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, even affirmatively;  and so completely was His statement to this effect, that they insisted on accepting that sense which His statement indicated. </p>

<p>For when He was brought before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, they proceeded to urge Him with the serious charge , of declaring Himself to be <em>Christ the King</em>;  that is, undoubtedly, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who was to sit at God's right hand. They would, however, have burdened Him  with some other title, if they had been uncertain whether He had called Himself <em>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>&mdash; if He had not pronounced the words, <q>You say that I am,</q> so as (to admit) that He was that which they said He was. Likewise, when Pirate asked Him, <q>Are you Christ (the King)?</q> He answered, as He had before (to the Jewish council)  <q>You say that I am</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035125"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;23:3</a></span> in order that He might not seem to have been driven by a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his power to give him a fuller answer. <q>And so the Lord has stood on His trial.</q>  And he placed His people on their trial. The Lord Himself comes to a trial with <q>the elders and rulers of the people,</q> as Isaiah predicted.  And then He fulfilled all that had been written of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. At that time <q>the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> raged, and the people imagined vain things; the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ.</q>  The <em><a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a></em> were <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and the Romans; the <em>people</em> were the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; the <em>kings</em> were represented in <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and the <em>rulers</em> in the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. When, indeed, He was sent to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> gratuitously  by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note035130"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;23:7</a></span> the words of Hosea were accomplished, for he had prophesied of Christ: <q>And they shall carry Him bound as a present to the king.</q>  <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was <q>exceeding glad</q> when he saw Jesus, but he heard not a word from Him. <span class="stiki" id="note035132"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;23:8-9</a></span> For, <q>as a lamb before the shearer is dumb, so He opened not His mouth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035133"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> because <q>the Lord had given to Him a disciplined tongue, that he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how and when it behooved Him to speak</q> &mdash; even that <q>tongue which clove to His jaws,</q> as the Psalm  said it should, through His not speaking. Then Barabbas, the most abandoned criminal, is released, as if he were the innocent man; while the most righteous Christ is delivered to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, as if he were the murderer. <span class="stiki" id="note035136"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;23:25</a></span> Moreover two malefactors are crucified around Him, in order that He might be reckoned among the transgressors.  Although His raiment was, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, parted among the soldiers, and partly distributed by lot, yet <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> has erased it all (from his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>),  for he had his eye upon the Psalm: <q>They parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</q>  You may as well take away the cross itself! But even then the Psalm is not silent concerning it: <q>They pierced my hands and my feet.</q>  Indeed, the details of the whole event are therein read: <q>Dogs compassed me about; the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> enclosed me around. All that looked upon me laughed me to scorn; they did shoot out their lips and shake their heads, (saying,) He hoped in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let Him deliver Him.</q>  Of what use now is (your tampering with) the testimony of His garments? If you take it as a booty for your false Christ, still all the Psalm (compensates) the vesture of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  But, behold, the very elements are shaken. For their Lord was suffering. If, however, it was their enemy to whom all this injury was done, the heaven would have gleamed with light, the sun would have been even more radiant, and the day would have prolonged its course <span class="stiki" id="note035143"><a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse13">Joshua&nbsp;10:13</a></span> &mdash; gladly gazing at <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> Christ suspended on his gibbet! These <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>  would still have been suitable for me, even if they had not been the subject of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Isaiah says: <q>I will clothe the heavens with blackness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035145"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;50:3</a></span> This will be the day, concerning which Amos also writes: And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, that the sun shall go down at noon and the earth shall be dark in the clear day. <span class="stiki" id="note035146"><a href="../bible/amo008.htm#verse9">Amos&nbsp;8:9</a></span> (At noon)  the veil of the temple was rent <span class="stiki" id="note035148"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse45">Luke&nbsp;23:45</a></span> by the escape of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note035149"><a href="../bible/eze011.htm#verse22">Ezekiel&nbsp;11:22-23</a></span> which <q>left the daughter of Sion as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035150"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;1:8</a></span> With what constancy has He also, in <a href="../bible/psa029.htm">Psalm xxx.</a>, laboured to present to us the very Christ!

Having said this, He gave up the ghost. <span class="stiki" id="note035152"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span> Who? Did the spirit  give itself up; or the flesh the spirit? But the spirit could not have breathed itself out. That which breathes is one thing, that which is breathed is another. If the spirit is breathed it must needs be breathed by another. If, however, there had been nothing there but spirit, it would be said to have <em>departed</em> rather than <em>expired</em>.  What, however, breathes out spirit but the flesh, which both <em>breathes</em> the spirit while it has it, and <em>breathes it out</em> when it loses it? Indeed, if it was not flesh (upon the cross), but a phantom  of flesh (and  a phantom is but spirit, and  so the spirit breathed its own self out, and departed as it did so), no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the phantom departed, when the spirit which was the phantom departed: and so the phantom and the spirit disappeared together, and were nowhere to be seen.  Nothing therefore remained upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, nothing hung there, after <q>the giving up of the ghost;</q>  there was nothing to beg of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, nothing to take down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, nothing to wrap in the linen, nothing to lay in the new sepulchre.  Still it was not <em>nothing</em>  that was there. What was there, then? If a phantom Christ was yet there. If Christ had departed, He had taken away the phantom also. The only shift left to the impudence of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, is to admit that what remained there was the phantom of a phantom! But what if Joseph <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was a body which he treated with so much <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>?  That same Joseph <q>who had not consented</q> with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their crime? <span class="stiki" id="note035163"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse51">Luke&nbsp;23:51</a></span> The <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> man who walked not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful.</q> </p>

<p>It was very meet that the man who buried the Lord should thus be noticed in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and thenceforth be <q>blessed;</q>  since <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> does not omit the (<a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>) office of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who resorted before day-break to the sepulchre with the spices which they had prepared.  <span class="stiki" id="note035166"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;24:1</a></span> For of this incident it is said by Hosea: <q>To seek my face they will watch till day-light, saying unto me, Come, and let us return to the Lord: for He has taken away, and He will heal us; He has smitten, and He will bind us up; after two days will He revive us: in the third day He will raise us up.</q>  For who can refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these words often revolved  in the thought of those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> between the sorrow of that desertion with which at present they seemed to themselves to have been smitten by the Lord, and the hope of the resurrection itself, by which they rightly supposed that all would be restored to them? But when <q>they found not the body (of the Lord Jesus),</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035169"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;24:3</a></span> <q>His sepulture was removed from the midst of them,</q>  according to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah. <q>Two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> however, appeared there.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035171"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;24:4</a></span> For just so many honorary companions  were required by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which usually prescribes <q> <em>two witnesses</em>.</q>  Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, returning from the sepulchre, and from this vision of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, were foreseen by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, when he says, <q>Come, you <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who return from the vision;</q>  that is, <q>come,</q> to report the resurrection of the Lord. It was well, however, that the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was so persistent, in order that to the last we might consistently maintain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> revealed Himself to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as none other than the Christ of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For as two of them were taking a walk, and when the Lord had joined their company, without its appearing that it was He, and while He dissembled His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what had just taken place, <span class="stiki" id="note035175"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;24:13-19</a></span> they say: <q>But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035176"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;24:21</a></span> &mdash; meaning their own, that is, the Creator's Christ. So far had He been from declaring Himself to them as another Christ! They could not, however, deem Him to be the Christ of the Creator; nor, if He was so deemed by them, could He have tolerated this opinion concerning Himself, unless He were really He whom He was supposed to be. Otherwise He would actually be the author of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and the prevaricator of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, contrary to the character of the good God. But at no time even after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> did He reveal Himself to them as any other than what, on their own showing, they had always thought Him to be. He pointedly  reproached them: <q>O fools, and slow of heart in not believing that which He spoke unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035178"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;24:25</a></span> By saying this, He proves that He does not belong to the rival god, but to the same God. For the same thing was said by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: <q>Remember how He spoke unto you when He was yet in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, saying, The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must be delivered up, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035179"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;24:6-7</a></span> <q> <em>Must</em> be delivered up;</q> and why, except that it was so written by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Creator? He therefore upbraided them, because they were offended solely at His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and because they <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the resurrection which had been reported to them by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, whereby (they showed that) they had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him to have been the very same as they had thought Him to be. Wishing, therefore, to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by them in this wise, He declared Himself to be just what they had deemed Him to be&mdash; the Creator's Christ, the Redeemer of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. But as touching the reality of His body, what can be plainer? When they were doubting whether He were not a phantom&mdash; nay, were supposing that He was one&mdash; He says to them, <q>Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? See  my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; for a spirit has not bones, as you see me have.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035181"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;24:37-39</a></span> Now <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> was unwilling to expunge from his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> some statements which even made against him&mdash; I suspect, on purpose, to have it in his power from the passages which he did not suppress, when he could have done so, either to deny that he had expunged anything, or else to justify his suppressions, if he made any. But he spares only such passages as he can subvert quite as well by explaining them away as by expunging them from the text. Thus, in the passage before us, he would have the words, <q>A spirit has not bones, as you see me have,</q> so transposed, as to mean, <q>A spirit, such as you see me to be, has not bones;</q> that is to say, it is not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a spirit to have bones. But what need of so tortuous a construction, when He might have simply said, <q>A spirit has not bones, even as you observe that I have not?</q> Why, moreover, does He offer His hands and His feet for their examination&mdash; limbs which consist of bones&mdash; if He had no bones? Why, too, does He add, <q>Know that it is I myself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note035182"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;24:39</a></span> when they had before <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him to be corporeal? Else, if He were altogether a phantom, why did He upbraid them for supposing Him to be a phantom? But while they still <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, He asked them for some meat, <span class="stiki" id="note035183"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;24:41</a></span> for the express purpose of showing them that He had teeth. </p>

<p>And now, as I would venture to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,  we have accomplished our undertaking. We have set forth <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as none other than the Christ of the Creator. Our <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> we have drawn from His doctrines, maxims,  affections, feelings, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, sufferings, and even resurrection&mdash; as foretold by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.  Even to the last He taught us (the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His mission), when He sent forth His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to preach His gospel <q>among all nations;</q>  for He thus fulfilled the psalm: <q>Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.</q>  <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, I pity you; your labour has been in vain. For the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who appears in your <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is mine.</p>
