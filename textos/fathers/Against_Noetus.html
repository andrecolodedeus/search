<h1>Against Noetus</h1>

<p></p>

<p>1. Some others are secretly introducing another doctrine, who have become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of one Noetus, who was a native of Smyrna,  (and) lived not very long ago.  This person was greatly puffed up and inflated with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, being inspired by the conceit of a strange spirit. He alleged that Christ was the Father Himself, and that the Father Himself was born, and suffered, and died. You see what <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of heart and what a strange inflated spirit had insinuated themselves into him. From his other actions, then, the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is already given us that he spoke not with a pure spirit; for he who blasphemes against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is cast out from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> inheritance. He alleged that he was himself <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was his brother.  When the blessed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> heard this, they summoned him before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and examined him. But he denied at first that he held such opinions. Afterwards, however, taking shelter among some, and having gathered round him some others who had embraced the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, he wished thereafter to uphold his dogma openly as correct. And the blessed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> called him again before them, and examined him. But he stood out against them, saying, <q>What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, then, am I doing in glorifying Christ? </q>And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> replied to him, <q>We too <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Son suffered even as He suffered, and died even as He died, and rose again on the third day, and is at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and comes to judge the living and the dead. And these things which we have learned we allege.</q> Then, after examining him, they expelled him from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And he was carried to such a pitch of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, that he established a school.</p>

<p>2. Now they seek to exhibit the foundation for their dogma by citing the word in the law, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers: you shall have no other gods beside me; </q> and again in another passage, <q>I am the first,</q> He says, <q>and the last; and beside me there is none other.</q> Thus they say they prove that God is one. And then they answer in this manner: <q>If therefore I acknowledge Christ to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is the Father Himself, if He is indeed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and Christ suffered, being Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and consequently the Father suffered, for He was the Father Himself.</q> But the case stands not thus; for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> do not set forth the matter in this manner. But they make use also of other testimonies, and say, Thus it is written: <q>This is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of Him. He has found out all the way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and has given it unto Jacob His servant (son), and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved. Afterward did He show Himself upon earth, and conversed with men.</q> You see, then, he says, that this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the only One, and who afterwards did show Himself, and con-versed with men. And in another place he says, <q><a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has laboured; and the merchandise of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto you, (and they shall be slaves to you); and they shall come after you bound with manacles, and they shall fall down unto you, because God is in you; and they shall make supplication unto you: and there is no God beside you. For You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not; God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour.</q> Do you see, he says, how the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> proclaim one God? And as this is clearly exhibited, and these passages are testimonies to it, I am under necessity, he says, since one is acknowledged, to make this One the subject of suffering. For Christ was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and suffered on account of us, being Himself the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He might be able also to save us. And we cannot express ourselves otherwise, he says; for the apostle also acknowledges one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he says, <q>Whose are the fathers, (and) of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</q></p>

<p>3. In this way, then, they choose to set forth these things, and they make use only of one class of passages; just in the same one-sided manner that Theodotus employed when he sought to prove that Christ was a mere man. But neither has the one party nor the other understood the matter rightly, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves confute their senselessness, and attest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. See, brethren, what a rash and audacious dogma they have introduced, when they say without shame, the Father is Himself Christ, Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Himself was born, Himself suffered, Himself raised Himself. But it is not so. The Scriptures speak what is right; but Noetus is of a different mind from them. Yet, though Noetus does not understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are not at once to be repudiated. For who will not say that there is one God? Yet he will not on that account deny the economy (i.e., the number and disposition of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the Trinity). The proper way, therefore, to deal with the question is first of all to refute the interpretation put upon these passages by these men, and then to explain their real meaning. For it is right, in the first place, to expound the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the Father is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, <q>of whom is every <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>,</q> <q>by whom are all things, of whom are all things, and we in Him.</q></p>

<p>4. Let us, as I said, see how he is confuted, and then let us set forth the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now he quotes the words, <q><a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has laboured, and the merchandise of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> and the Sabeans,</q> and so forth on to the words, <q>For You are the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour.</q> And these words he cites without understanding what precedes them. For whenever they wish to attempt anything underhand, they mutilate the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. But let him quote the passage as a whole, and he will discover the reason kept in view in writing it. For we have the beginning of the section a little above; and we ought, of course, to commence there in showing to whom and about whom the passage speaks. For above, the beginning of the section stands thus: <q>Ask me concerning my sons and my daughters, and concerning the work of my hands, command me. I have made the earth, and man upon it: I with my hand have established the heaven; I have commanded all the stars. I have raised him up, and all his ways are straight. He shall build my city, and he shall turn back the captivity; not for price nor reward, said the Lord of hosts. Thus said the Lord of hosts, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has laboured, and the merchandise of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto you, and they shall be slaves to you: and they shall come after you bound with manacles, and they shall fall down unto you; and they shall make supplication unto you, because God is in you; and there is no God beside you. For You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not; the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>,</q> <q>In you, therefore,</q> says he, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is.</q> But in whom is God except in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, the Father's Word, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the economy? And again, exhibiting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> regarding Him, he points to the fact of His being in the flesh when He says, <q>I have raised Him up in righteousness, and all His ways are straight.</q> For what is this? Of whom does the Father thus testify? It is of the Son that the Father says, <q>I have raised Him up in righteousness.</q> And that the Father did raise up His Son in righteousness, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, saying, <q>But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwells in you.</q> Behold, the word spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is thus made good, <q>I have raised Him up in righteousness.</q> And in saying, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in you,</q> he referred to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the economy, because when the Word was made incarnate and became man, the Father was in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, while the Son was living among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. This, therefore, was signified, brethren, that in reality the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the economy by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the Virgin was this Word, constituting yet one Son to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And it is not simply that I say this, but He Himself attests it who came down from heaven; for He speaks thus: <q>No man has ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> which is in heaven.</q> What then can he seek beside what is thus written? Will he say, forsooth, that flesh was in heaven? Yet there is the flesh which was presented by the Father's Word as an offering,&mdash; the flesh that came by the Spirit and the Virgin, (and was) demonstrated to be the perfect <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. It is evident, therefore, that He offered Himself to the Father. And before this there was no flesh in heaven. Who, then, was in heaven but the Word unincarnate, who was dispatched to show that He was upon earth and was also in heaven? For He was Word, He was Spirit, He was Power. The same took to Himself the name common and current among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and was called from the beginning the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> on account of what He was to be, although He was not yet man, as Daniel testifies when he says, <q>I saw, and behold one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came on the clouds of heaven.</q> Rightly, then, did he say that He who was in heaven was called from the beginning by this name, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, as being that from the beginning.</p>

<p>5. But what is meant, says he, in the other passage: <q>This is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of Him? </q> That said he rightly. For in comparison of the Father who shall be accounted of? But he says: <q>This is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of Him. He has found out all the way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and has given it unto Jacob His servant, and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved.</q> He says well. For who is Jacob His servant, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved, but He of whom He cries, saying, <q>This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased: hear Him? </q> Having received, then, all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the perfect <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Jacob, afterward did show Himself upon earth, and conversed with men. And who, again, is meant by <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> but <em>a man who sees God?</em> and there is no one who sees God except the Son alone, the perfect man who alone declares the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father. For John also says, <q>No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has declared  Him.</q>  And again: <q>He who came down from heaven testifies what He has heard and seen.</q>  This, then, is He to whom the Father has given all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, who did show Himself upon earth, and conversed with men.</p>

<p>6. Let us look next at the apostle's word: <q>Whose are the fathers, of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</q>  This word declares the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> rightly and clearly. He who is over all is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for thus He speaks boldly, <q>All things are delivered unto me of my Father.</q>  He who is over all, God blessed, has been born; and having been made man, He is (yet) God for ever. For to this effect John also has said, <q>Which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</q>  And well has he named Christ the Almighty. For in this he has said only what Christ testifies of Himself. For Christ gave this testimony, and said, <q>All things are delivered unto me of my Father; </q>  and Christ rules all things, and has been appointed  Almighty by the Father. And in like manner <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, in setting forth the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that all things are delivered unto Him, said, <q>Christ the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>; afterwards they that are Christ's at His coming. Then comes the end, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the Father; when He shall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power. For He must reign, till He has put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For all things are put under Him. But when He says, All things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted which did put all things under Him. Then shall He also Himself be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.</q>  If, therefore, all things are put under Him with the exception of Him who put them under Him, He is Lord of all, and the Father is Lord of Him, that in all there might be manifested one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom all things are made subject together with Christ, to whom the Father has made all things subject, with the exception of Himself. And this, indeed, is said by Christ Himself, as when in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> He confessed Him to be His Father and His God. For He speaks thus: <q>I go to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</q>  If then, Noetus ventures to say that He is the Father Himself, to what father will he say Christ goes away according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? But if he will have us abandon the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and give credence to his senselessness, he expends his labour in vain; for <q>we ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> God rather than men.</q> </p>

<p>7. If, again, he allege His own word when He said, <q>I and the Father are one,</q>  let him attend to the fact, and understand that He did not say, <q>I and the Father <em>am one</em>, but <em>are one</em>.</q>  For the word <em>are</em>  is not said of one person, but it refers to <em>two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a></em>, and one power.  He has Himself made this clear, when He spoke to His Father concerning the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which You gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and You in me, that they may be made perfect in one; that the world may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You have sent me.</q>  What have the Noetians to say to these things? Are all one body in respect of substance, or is it that we become one in the power and disposition of unity of mind?  In the same manner the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who was sent and was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of those who are in the world, confessed that He was in the Father in power and disposition. For the Son is the one mind of the Father. We who have the Father's mind <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> so (in Him); but they who have it not have denied the Son. And if, again, they choose to allege the fact that Philip inquired about the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, <q>Show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and it suffices us,</q> to whom the Lord made answer in these terms: <q>Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father. Do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in me? </q>  and if they choose to maintain that their dogma is ratified by this passage, as if He owned Himself to be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is decidedly against them, and that they are confuted by this very word. For though Christ had spoken of Himself, and showed Himself among all as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, they had not yet recognised Him to be such, neither had they been able to apprehend or contemplate His real power. And Philip, not having been able to receive this, as far as it was possible to see it, requested to behold the Father. To whom then the Lord said, <q>Philip, have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me? He that has seen me has seen the Father.</q> By which He means, If you have seen me, you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father through me. For through the image, which is like (the original), the Father is made readily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But if you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the image, which is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, how do you seek to see the Father? And that this is the case is made clear by the rest of the chapter, which signifies that the Son who <q>has been set forth  was sent from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,  and goes to the Father.</q> </p>

<p>8. Many other passages, or rather all of them, attest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. A man, therefore, even though he will it not, is compelled to acknowledge <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, and Christ Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, became man, to whom also the Father made all things subject, Himself excepted, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and that these, therefore, are three. But if he desires to learn how it is shown still that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that His power  is one. As far as regards the power, therefore, God is one. But as far as regards the economy there is a threefold manifestation, as shall be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> afterwards when we give account of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine. In these things, however, which are thus set forth by us, we are at one. For there is one God in whom we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but unoriginated, impassible, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, doing all things as He wills, in the way He wills, and when He wills. What, then, will this Noetus, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>  nothing of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, dare to say to these things? And now, as Noetus has been confuted, let us turn to the exhibition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, that we may establish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, against which all these mighty <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>  have arisen without being able to state anything to the purpose.</p>

<p>9. There is, brethren, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of whom we gain from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and from no other source. For just as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he wishes to be skilled in the wisdom of this world, will find himself unable to get at it in any other way than by mastering the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, so all of us who wish to practise <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> will be unable to learn its practice from any other quarter than the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Whatever things, then, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> declare, at these let us took; and whatsoever things they teach, these let us learn; and as the Father wills our belief to be, let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and as He wills the Son to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, let us glorify Him; and as He wills the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be bestowed, let us receive Him. Not according to our own will, nor according to our own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nor yet as using violently those things which are given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but even as He has chosen to teach them by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, so let us discern them.</p>

<p>10. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, subsisting alone, and having nothing contemporaneous with Himself, determined to create the world. And conceiving the world in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and willing and uttering the word, He made it; and straightway it appeared, formed as it had pleased Him. For us, then, it is sufficient simply to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there was nothing contemporaneous with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Beside Him there was nothing; but  He, while existing alone, yet <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in plurality.  For He was neither without reason, nor wisdom, nor power, nor counsel  And all things were in Him, and He was the All. When He willed, and as He willed,  He manifested His word in the times determined by Him, and by Him He made all things. When He wills, He does; and when He thinks, He executes; and when He speaks, He manifests; when He fashions, He contrives in wisdom. For all things that are made He forms by reason and wisdom&mdash; creating them in reason, and arranging them in wisdom. He made them, then, as He pleased, for He was God. And as the Author, and fellow-Counsellor, and Framer  of the things that are in formation, He begot  the Word; and as He bears this Word in Himself, and that, too, as (yet) invisible to the world which is created, He makes Him visible; (and) uttering the voice first, and begetting Him as Light of Light,  He set Him forth to the world as its Lord, (and) His own mind;  and whereas He was visible formerly to Himself alone, and invisible to the world which is made, He makes Him visible in order that the world might see Him in His manifestation, and be capable of being saved.</p>

<p>11. And thus there appeared another beside Himself. But when I say <em>another</em>,  I do not mean that there are two Gods, but that it is only as light of light, or as water from a fountain, or as a ray from the sun. For there is but one power, which is from the All;  and the Father is the All, from whom comes this Power, the Word. And this is the mind  which came forth into the world, and was manifested as the Son  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things, then, are by Him, and He alone is of the Father. Who then adduces a multitude of gods brought in, time after time? For all are shut up, however unwillingly, to admit this fact, that the All runs up into one. If, then, all things run up into one, even according to <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, and all their fooleries, they are also reduced, however unwillingly, to this position, that they must acknowledge that the One is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things. Thus, then, these too, though they wish it not, fall in with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and admit that one God made all things according to His good pleasure. And He gave the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and in giving them, He made them speak by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in order that, being gifted with the inspiration of the Father's power, they might declare the Father's counsel and will.</p>

<p>12. Acting then in these (<a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>), the Word spoke of Himself. For already He became His own herald, and showed that the Word would be manifested among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And for this reason He cried thus: <q>I am made manifest to them that sought me not; I am found of them that asked not for me.</q>  And who is He that is made manifest but the Word of the Father?&mdash; whom the Father sent, and in whom He showed to men the power proceeding from Him. Thus, then, was the Word made manifest, even as the blessed John says. For he sums up the things that were said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and shows that this is the Word, by whom all things were made. For he speaks to this effect: <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.</q>  And beneath He says, <q>The world was made by Him, and the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not; He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.</q>  If, then, said he, the world was made by Him, according to the word of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made,</q>  then this is the Word that was also made manifest. We accordingly see the Word incarnate, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father by Him, and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, (and) we worship the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Let us then look at the testimony of Scripture. with respect to the announcement of the future manifestation of the Word.</p>

<p>13. Now Jeremiah says, <q>Who has stood in the counsel  of the Lord, and has perceived His Word? </q>  But the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> alone is visible, while the word of man is audible. When he speaks of seeing the Word, I must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this visible (Word) has been sent. And there was none other (sent) but the Word. And that He was sent Peter testifies, when he says to the centurion Cornelius: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Word unto the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. This is the God who is Lord of all.</q>  If, then, the Word is sent by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the will  of the Father is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>14. These things then, brethren, are declared by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. And the blessed John, in the testimony of his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, gives us an account of this economy (disposition) and acknowledges this Word as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he says, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> If, then, the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what follows? Would one say that he speaks of two Gods?  I shall not indeed speak of two Gods, but of one; of two Persons however, and of a third economy (disposition), viz., the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the Father indeed is One, but there are two Persons, because there is also the Son; and then there is the third, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The Father decrees, the Word executes, and the Son is manifested, through whom the Father is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on. The economy  of harmony is led back to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for God is One. It is the Father who commands,  and the Son who obeys, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who gives understanding:  the Father who is <em>above all</em>,  and the Son who is <em>through all</em>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who is <em>in all</em>. And we cannot otherwise think of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  but by believing in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> (or gloried in) the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but gave Him not thanks, for they did not recognise the Son. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> recognised the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but not in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; wherefore they also denied Him.  The Father's Word, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the economy (disposition) and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to wit, that the Father seeks to be worshipped in none other way than this, gave this charge to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after He rose from the dead: <q>Go and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  And by this He showed, that whosoever omitted any one of these, failed in glorifying God perfectly. For it is through this Trinity that the Father is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. For the Father willed, the Son did, the Spirit manifested. The whole Scriptures, then, proclaim this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>15. But some one will say to me, You adduce a thing strange to me, when you call the Son the Word. For John indeed speaks of the Word, but it is by a figure of speech. <em>Nay, it is by no figure of speech</em>.  For while thus presenting this Word that was from the beginning, and has now been sent forth, he said below in the Apocalypse, <q>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him (was) Faithful and True; and in righteousness He does judge and make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. And His eyes (were) as flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns; and He had a name written that no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> but He Himself. And He (was) clothed in a vesture dipped in blood: and His name is called the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.</q>  See then, brethren, how the vesture sprinkled with blood denoted in <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> the flesh, through which the impassible <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> came under suffering, as also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> testify to me. For thus speaks the blessed Micah: <q>The house of Jacob provoked the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. These are their pursuits. Are not His words good with them, and do they walk rightly? And they have risen up in enmity against His countenance of peace, and they have stripped off His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q>  That means His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> in the flesh. And in like manner also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> says, <q>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be shown in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</q>  What Son of His own, then, did God send through the flesh but the Word,  whom He addressed as Son because He was to become such (or be begotten) in the future? And He takes the common name for tender affection among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in being called the Son. For neither was the Word, prior to <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and when by Himself,  yet perfect Son, although He was perfect Word, only-begotten. Nor could the flesh subsist by itself apart from the Word, because it has its subsistence  in the Word.  Thus, then, one perfect <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was manifested.</p>

<p>16. And these indeed are testimonies bearing on the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Word; and there are also very many others. But let us also look at the subject in hand&mdash;namely, the question, brethren, that in reality the Father's power, which is the Word, came down from heaven, and not the Father Himself. For thus He speaks: <q>I came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and have come.</q>  Now what subject is meant in this sentence, <q>I came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>  but just the Word? And what is it that is begotten of Him, but just the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,  that is to say, the Word? But you will say to me, How is He begotten? In your own case you can give no explanation of the way in which you were begotten, although you see every day the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> according to man; neither can you tell with accuracy the economy in His case.  For you have it not in your power to acquaint yourself with the practised and indescribable art  (method) of the Maker, but only to see, and understand, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that man is God's work. Moreover, you are asking an account of the generation of the Word, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father in His good pleasure begot as He willed. Is it not enough for you to learn that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the world, but do you also venture to ask whence He made it? Is it not enough for you to learn that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has been manifested to you for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but do you also inquire curiously how He was begotten after the Spirit? No more than two,  in truth, have been put in trust to give the account of His generation after the flesh; and are you then so bold as to seek the account (of His generation) after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which the Father keeps with Himself, intending to reveal it then to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones and those worthy of seeing His face? Rest satisfied with the word spoken by Christ, viz., <q>That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,</q>  just as, speaking by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the generation of the Word, He shows the fact that He is begotten, but reserves the question of the manner and means, to reveal it only in the time determined by Himself. For He speaks thus: <q>From the womb, before the morning star, I have begotten You.</q> </p>

<p>17. These testimonies are sufficient for the believing who study <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the unbelieving credit no testimony.  For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, indeed, in the person of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, has testified to this, saying, <q>And who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report? </q>  Therefore let us not prove ourselves unbelieving, lest the word spoken be fulfilled in us. Let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> then, dear  brethren, according to the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> came down from heaven, (and entered) into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin Mary, in order that, taking the flesh from her, and assuming also a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, by which I mean a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and becoming thus all that man is with the exception of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He might save fallen man, and confer <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> on men who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His name. In all, therefore, the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is demonstrated to us, to wit, that the Father is One, whose word is present (with Him), by whom He made all things; whom also, as we have said above, the Father sent forth in later times for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men. This (Word) was preached by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as destined to come into the world. And even as He was preached then, in the same manner also did He come and manifest Himself, being by the Virgin and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> made a new man; for in that He had the heavenly (nature) of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the Word and the earthly (nature), as taking to Himself the flesh from the old <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by the medium of the Virgin, He now, coming forth into the world, was manifested as God in a body, coming forth too as a perfect man. For it was not in mere appearance or by conversion,  but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that He became man.</p>

<p>18.  Thus then, too, though demonstrated as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He does not refuse the conditions proper to Him as man,  since He hungers and toils and thirsts in weariness, and flees in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in trouble. And He who as God has a sleepless nature, slumbers on a pillow. And He who for this end came into the world, begs off from the cup of suffering. And in an agony He sweats blood, and is strengthened by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who Himself strengthens those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and taught men to despise death by His work.  And He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what manner of man Judas was, is betrayed by Judas. And He, who formerly was honoured by him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is contemned by <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>.  And He is set at nought by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who is Himself to judge the whole earth. And He is scourged by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, who took upon Himself our infirmities. And by the soldiers He is mocked, at whose behest stand thousands of thousands and myriads of myriads of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and archangels. And He who fixed the heavens like a vault is fastened to the cross by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And He who is inseparable from the Father cries to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and commends to Him His spirit; and bowing His head, He gives up the ghost, who said, <q>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again; </q>  and because He was not overmastered by death, as being Himself Life, He said this: <q>I lay it down of myself.</q>  And He who gives life bountifully to all, has His side pierced with a spear. And He who raises the dead is wrapped in linen and laid in a sepulchre, and on the third day He is raised again by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, though Himself the Resurrection and the Life. For all these things has He finished for us, who for our sakes was made as we are. For <q>Himself has borne our infirmities, and carried our diseases; and for our sakes He was afflicted,</q>  as Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has said. This is He who was hymned by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and seen by the shepherds, and waited for by Simeon, and witnessed to by Anna. This is He who was inquired after by the wise men, and indicated by the star; He who was engaged in His Father's house, and pointed to by John, and witnessed to by the Father from above in the voice, <q>This is my beloved Son; hear Him.</q>  He is crowned victor against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.  This is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, who was invited to the marriage-feast in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>, and turned the water into wine, and rebuked the sea when agitated by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the winds, and walked on the deep as on dry land, and caused the blind man from birth to see, and raised Lazarus to life after he had been dead four days, and did many mighty works, and forgave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and conferred power on the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and had blood and water flowing from His sacred side when pierced with the spear. For His sake the sun is darkened, the day has no light, the rocks are shattered, the veil is rent, the foundations of the earth are shaken, the graves are opened, and the dead are raised, and the rulers are ashamed when they see the Director of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> upon the cross closing His eye and giving up the ghost. Creation saw, and was troubled; and, unable to bear the sight of His exceeding <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, shrouded itself in darkness.  This (is He who) breathes upon the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and gives them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and comes in among them when the doors are shut, and is taken up by a cloud into the heavens while the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> gaze at Him, and is set down on the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and comes again as the Judge of the living and the dead. This is the God who for our sakes became man, to whom also the Father has put all things in subjection. To Him be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the power, with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church both now and ever, and even for evermore. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
