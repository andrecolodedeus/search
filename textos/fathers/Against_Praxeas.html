<h1>Against Praxeas</h1>


<p>In Which He Defends, in all Essential Points, the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity. </p>

<h2 class="chapter1">Chapter 1. Satan's Wiles Against the Truth. How They Take the Form of the Praxean Heresy. Account of the Publication of This Heresy</h2>

<p>In various ways has the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rivalled and resisted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Sometimes his aim has been to destroy the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by defending it. He maintains that there is one only Lord, the Almighty Creator of the world, in order that out of this <em>doctrine of the</em> unity he may fabricate a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He says that the Father Himself came down into the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed was Himself <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Here the <em>old</em> serpent has fallen out with himself, since, when he tempted Christ after John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he approached Him as <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> surely intimating that God had a Son, even on the testimony of the very Scriptures, out of which he was at the moment forging his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: <q>If you are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037768"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;4:3</a></span> Again: <q>If you are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, cast yourself down from hence;  for it is written, He shall give His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge concerning you</q>&mdash; referring no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, to the Father&mdash; <q>and in their hands they shall bear you up, that you hurt not your foot against a stone.</q>  Or perhaps, after all, he was only reproaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> with a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, saying in fact: <q>Away with Matthew; away with Luke! <em>Why heed their words</em>? In spite of them, <em>I declare</em> that it was God Himself that I approached; it was the Almighty Himself that I tempted face to face; and it was for no other purpose than to tempt Him that I approached Him. If, on the contrary, it had been <em>only</em> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, most likely I should never have condescended to deal with Him.</q> However, he is himself a liar from the beginning, <span class="stiki" id="note037771"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> and whatever man he instigates in his own way; as, for instance, Praxeas. For <em>he</em> was the first to import into Rome from Asia this kind of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pravity, a man in other respects of restless disposition, and above all inflated with the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of confessorship simply and solely because he had to bear for a short time the annoyance of a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; on which occasion, even <q>if he had given his body to be burned, it would have profited him nothing,</q> not having the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note037772"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> whose very gifts he has resisted and destroyed. For after the Bishop of Rome  had acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetic</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, Prisca, and Maximilla, and, in consequence of the acknowledgment, had bestowed his peace  on the churches of Asia and Phrygia, <em>he</em>, by importunately urging false accusations against the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> themselves and their churches, and insisting on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> predecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the pacific letter which he had issued, as well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging the <em>said</em> gifts. By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: he drove away <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and he brought in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father. Praxeas' tares had been moreover sown, and had produced their fruit here also,  while many were asleep in their simplicity of doctrine; but these tares actually seemed to have been plucked up, having been discovered and exposed by him whose agency God was pleased to employ. Indeed, <em>Praxeas</em> had deliberately resumed his old (<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>) <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, teaching it after his renunciation of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and there is his own handwriting in evidence remaining among the carnally-minded,  in whose society the transaction then took place; afterwards nothing was heard of him. We indeed, on our part, subsequently withdrew from the carnally-minded on our acknowledgment and maintenance of the Paraclete.  But the tares <em>of Praxeas</em> had then everywhere shaken out their seed, which having lain hid for some while, with its vitality concealed under a mask, has now broken out with fresh life. But again shall it be rooted up, if the Lord will, even now; but if not now, in the day when all bundles of tares shall be gathered together, and along with every other stumbling-block shall be burnt up with unquenchable fire. <span class="stiki" id="note037778"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;13:30</a></span> </p>

<h2 class="chapter2">Chapter 2. The Catholic Doctrine of the Trinity and Unity, Sometimes Called the Divine Economy, or Dispensation of the Personal Relations of the Godhead</h2>

<p>In the course of time, then, the Father forsooth was born, and the Father suffered, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, the Lord Almighty, whom in their preaching they declare to be <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. We, however, as we indeed always have done (and more especially since we have been better instructed by the Paraclete, who leads men indeed into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>), <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but under the following dispensation, or <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, as it is called, that this one only God has also a Son, His Word, who proceeded  from Himself, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made. Him <em>we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></em> to have been sent by the Father into the Virgin, and to have been born of her&mdash; being both Man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and to have been called by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; <em>we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></em> Him to have suffered, died, and been buried, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and, after He had been raised again by the Father and taken back to heaven, to be sitting at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>and</em> that He will come to judge the quick and the dead; who sent also from heaven from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, according to His own promise, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Paraclete,  the sanctifier of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. That this rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has come down to us from the beginning of the gospel, even before any of the older <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, much more before Praxeas, <em>a pretender</em> of yesterday, will be apparent both from the lateness of date  which marks all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and also from the absolutely novel character of our new-fangled Praxeas. In this principle also we must henceforth find a presumption of equal force against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> whatsoever&mdash; that whatever is first is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whereas that is spurious which is later in date.  But keeping this prescriptive rule inviolate, still some opportunity must be given for reviewing (the statements of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>), with a view to the instruction and protection of various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; were it only that it may not seem that each perversion <em>of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em> is condemned without examination, and simply prejudged;  especially in the case of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which supposes itself to possess the pure <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in thinking that one cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in One Only God in any other way than by saying that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are the very selfsame Person. As if in this way also one were not All, in that All are of One, by unity (that is) of substance; while the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the dispensation  is still guarded, which distributes the Unity into a Trinity, placing in their order  the three <em>Persons</em>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: three, however, not in condition,  but in degree;  not in substance, but in form; not in power, but in aspect;  yet of one substance, and of one condition, and of one power, inasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, from whom these degrees and forms and aspects are reckoned, under the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.  How they are susceptible of number without division, will be shown as our treatise proceeds.</p>

<h2 class="chapter3">Chapter 3. Sundry Popular Fears and Prejudices. The Doctrine of the Trinity in Unity Rescued from These Misapprehensions</h2>

<p>The simple, indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned,) who always constitute the majority of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, are startled at the dispensation  (of the Three in One), on the ground that their very rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> withdraws them from the world's plurality of gods to the one only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not understanding that, although He is the one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He must yet be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in with His own <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> . The numerical order and distribution of the Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity; whereas the Unity which derives the Trinity out of its own self is so far from being destroyed, that it is actually supported by it. They are constantly throwing out against us that we are preachers of two gods and three gods, while they take to themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as if the Unity itself with irrational deductions did not produce <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and the Trinity rationally considered constitute the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. We, say they, maintain the <em>Monarchy</em> (or, <em>sole government</em> of God).  And so, as far as the sound goes, do even Latins (and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> ones too) pronounce the word in such a way that you would suppose their understanding of the <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x1F77;&#x03B1; (</span> or <em>Monarchy</em>) was as complete as their pronunciation of the term. Well, then Latins take pains to pronounce the <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> (or <em>Monarchy</em>), while Greeks actually refuse to understand the <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, or <em>Dispensation</em> (<em>of the Three in One</em>). As for myself, however, if I have gleaned any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of either language, I am sure that <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> (or <em>Monarchy</em>) has no other meaning than single and individual  rule; but for all that, this monarchy does not, because it is the government of one, preclude him whose government it is, either from having a son, or from having made himself actually a son to himself,  or from ministering his own monarchy by whatever agents he will. Nay more, I contend that no dominion so belongs to one only, as his own, or is in such a sense singular, or is in such a sense a monarchy, as not also to be administered through other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> most closely connected with it, and whom it has itself provided as officials to itself. If, moreover, there be a son belonging to him whose monarchy it is, it does not immediately become divided and cease to be a monarchy, if the son also be taken as a sharer in it; but it is as to its origin equally his, by whom it is communicated to the son; and being his, it is quite as much a monarchy (or <em>sole empire</em>), since it is held together by two who are so inseparable.  Therefore, inasmuch as the Divine Monarchy also is administered by so many legions and hosts of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according as it is written, <q>Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037795"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse10">Daniel&nbsp;7:10</a></span> and since it has not from this circumstance ceased to be the rule of one (so as no longer to be a monarchy), because it is administered by so many thousands of powers; how comes it to pass that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be thought to suffer division and severance in the Son and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who have the second and the third places assigned to them, and who are so closely joined with the Father in His substance, when He suffers no such (division and severance) in the multitude of so many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? Do you really suppose that Those, who are naturally members of the Father's own substance, pledges of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,  instruments of His might, nay, His power itself and the entire system of His monarchy, are the overthrow and destruction thereof? You are not right in so thinking. I prefer your exercising yourself on the meaning of the thing rather than on the sound of the word. Now you must understand the overthrow of a monarchy to be <em>this</em>, when another dominion, which has a framework and a state peculiar to itself (and is therefore a rival), is brought in over and above it: when, <em>e.g.</em>, some other god is introduced in opposition to the Creator, as in the opinions of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>; or when many gods are introduced, according to your Valentinuses and your Prodicuses. Then it amounts to an overthrow of the Monarchy, since it involves the destruction of the Creator. </p>

<h2 class="chapter4">Chapter 4. The Unity of the Godhead and the Supremacy and Sole Government of the Divine Being. The Monarchy Not at All Impaired by the Catholic Doctrine</h2>

<p>But as for me, who derive the Son from no other source but from the substance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and (represent Him) as doing nothing without the Father's will, and as having received all power from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, how can I be possibly destroying the Monarchy from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when I preserve it in the Son just as it was committed to Him by the Father? The same remark (I wish also to be formally) made by me with respect to the third degree <em>in the Godhead</em>, because I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Spirit <em>to proceed</em> from no other source than from the Father through the Son.  Look to it then, that it be not <em>you</em> rather who are destroying the Monarchy, when you overthrow the arrangement and dispensation   of it, which has been constituted in just as many names as it has pleased God <em>to employ</em>. But it remains so firm and stable in its own state, notwithstanding the introduction into it of the Trinity, that the Son actually has to restore it entire to the Father; even as the apostle says in his epistle, concerning the very end of all: <q>When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the Father; for He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037799"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:24-25</a></span> following of course the words of the Psalm: <q>Sit on my right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool.</q>  <q>When, however, all things shall be subdued to Him, (with the exception of Him who did put all things under Him,) then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037801"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:27-28</a></span> We thus see that the Son is no obstacle to the Monarchy, although it is now administered by  the Son; because with the Son it is still in its own state, and with its own state will be restored to the Father by the Son. No one, therefore, will impair it, on account of admitting the Son (to it), since it is certain that it has been committed to Him by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and by and by has to be again delivered up by Him to the Father. Now, from this one passage of the epistle of the <em>inspired</em> apostle, we have been already able to show that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are two <em>separate Persons</em>, not only by the mention of their separate names as Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but also by the fact that He who delivered up the kingdom, and He to whom it is delivered up&mdash; and in like manner, He who subjected (all things), and He to whom they were subjected&mdash; must necessarily be two different Beings.</p>

<h2 class="chapter5">Chapter 5. The Evolution of the Son or Word of God from the Father by a Divine Procession. Illustrated by the Operation of the Human Thought and Consciousness</h2>

<p>But since they will have the Two to be but One, so that the Father shall be deemed to be the same as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it is only right that the whole question respecting the Son should be examined, as to whether He exists, and who He is and the mode of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Thus shall the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself  secure its own sanction  from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and the interpretations which guard  them. There are some who allege that even Genesis opens thus in Hebrew: <q>In the beginning God made for Himself a Son.</q>  As there is no ground for this, I am led to other arguments derived from God's own dispensation,  in which He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the creation of the world, up to the generation of the Son. For before all things God was alone&mdash; being in Himself and for Himself <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and space, and all things. Moreover, He was alone, because there was nothing external to Him but Himself. Yet even not then was He alone; for He had with Him that which He possessed in Himself, that is to say, His own Reason. For God is rational, and Reason was first in Him; and so all things were from Himself. This Reason is His own Thought (or Consciousness)  which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, by which term we also designate Word <em>or Discourse</em>  and therefore it is now usual with our people, owing to the mere simple interpretation of the term, to say that the Word  was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; although it would be more suitable to regard Reason as the more ancient; because God had not Word  from the beginning, but He had Reason  even before the beginning; because also Word itself consists of Reason, which it thus proves to have been the prior <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as being its own substance.  Not that this distinction is of any practical moment. For although God had not yet sent <em>out</em> His Word,  He still had Him within Himself, both in company with and included within His very Reason, as He silently planned and arranged within Himself everything which He was afterwards about to utter  through His Word. Now, while He was thus planning and arranging with His own Reason, He was actually causing that to become Word which He was dealing with in the way of Word <em>or Discourse</em>.  And that you may the more readily understand this, consider first of all, from your own self, who are made <q>in the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037817"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> for what purpose it is that you also possess reason in yourself, who are a rational creature, as being not only made by a rational Artificer, but actually animated out of His substance. Observe, then, that when you are silently conversing  with yourself, this very process is carried on within you by your reason, which meets you with a word at every movement of your thought, at every impulse of your conception. Whatever you think, there is a word; whatever you conceive, there is reason. You must needs speak it in your mind; and while you are speaking, you admit speech as an interlocutor with you, involved in which there is this very reason, whereby, while in thought you are holding converse with your word, you are (by reciprocal action) producing thought by means of that converse with your word. Thus, in a certain sense, the word is a second <em>person</em> within you, through which in thinking you utter speech, and through which also, (by reciprocity of process,) in uttering speech you generate thought. The word is itself a different thing from yourself. Now how much more fully is all this transacted in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose image and likeness even you are regarded as being, inasmuch as He has reason within Himself even while He is silent, and involved in that Reason His Word! I may therefore without rashness first lay this down (as a fixed principle) that even then before the creation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> God was not alone, since He had within Himself both Reason, and, inherent in Reason, His Word, which He made second to Himself by agitating it within Himself.</p>

<h2 class="chapter6">Chapter 6. The Word of God is Also the Wisdom of God. The Going Forth of Wisdom to Create the Universe, According to the Divine Plan</h2>

<p>This power and disposition  of the Divine Intelligence  is set forth also in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> under the name of <span class="greek">&#x03A3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, Wisdom; for what can be better entitled to the name of Wisdom  than the Reason or the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>? Listen therefore to Wisdom herself, constituted in the character of a Second Person: <q>At the first the Lord created me as the beginning of His ways, with a view to His own works, before He made the earth, before the mountains were settled; moreover, before all the hills did He beget me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037821"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22-25</a></span> that is to say, He created and generated me in His own intelligence. Then, again, observe the distinction between them implied in the companionship of Wisdom with the Lord. <q>When He prepared the heaven,</q> says <em>Wisdom</em>, <q>I was present with Him; and when He made His strong places upon the winds, which are the clouds above; and when He secured the fountains, (and all things) which are beneath the sky, I was by, arranging all things with Him; I was by, in whom He delighted; and daily, too, did I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in His presence.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037822"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;8:27-30</a></span> Now, as soon as it pleased God to put forth into their respective substances and forms the things which He had planned and ordered within Himself, in conjunction with His Wisdom's Reason and Word, He first put forth the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself, having within Him His own inseparable Reason and Wisdom, in order that all things might be made through Him through whom they had been planned and disposed, yea, and already made, so far forth as (they were) in the mind and intelligence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This, however, was still wanting to them, that they should also be openly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and kept permanently in their proper forms and substances.</p>

<h2 class="chapter7">Chapter 7. The Son by Being Designated Word and Wisdom, (According to the Imperfection of Human Thought and Language) Liable to Be Deemed a Mere Attribute. He is Shown to Be a Personal Being</h2>

<p>Then, therefore, does the Word also Himself assume His own form and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> garb,  <em>His own</em> sound and vocal utterance, when God says, <q>Let there be light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037824"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3</a></span> This is the perfect nativity of the Word, when He proceeds forth from God&mdash; <em>formed</em>  by Him first to devise and think out <em>all things</em> under the name of Wisdom&mdash; <q>The Lord created <em>or formed</em>  me as the beginning of His ways;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037827"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22</a></span> then afterward <em>begotten</em>, to carry all into effect&mdash; <q>When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him.</q>  Thus does He make Him equal to Him: for by proceeding from Himself He became His first-begotten Son, because begotten before all things; <span class="stiki" id="note037829"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> and His only-begotten also, because alone begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in a way peculiar to Himself, from the womb of His own heart&mdash; even as the Father Himself testifies: <q>My heart,</q> says He, <q>has emitted my most excellent Word.</q>  <em>The Father</em> took pleasure evermore in Him, who equally rejoiced with a reciprocal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in the Father's presence: <q>You are my Son, today have I begotten You;</q>  even before the morning star did I beget You. The Son likewise acknowledges the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, speaking in His own person, under the name of Wisdom: <q>The Lord formed Me as the beginning of His ways, with a view to His own works; before all the hills did He beget Me.</q>  For if indeed Wisdom in this passage seems to say that She was created by the Lord with a view to His works, and to accomplish His ways, yet <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is given in another Scripture that <q>all things were made by the Word, and without Him was there nothing made;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037833"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> as, again, in another place (it is said), <q>By His word were the heavens established, and all the powers thereof by His Spirit</q> &mdash; that is to say, by the Spirit (or Divine Nature) which was in the Word: <em>thus</em> is it evident that it is one and the same power which is in one place described under the name of Wisdom, and in another passage under the appellation of the Word, which was initiated for the works of God <span class="stiki" id="note037835"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22</a></span> which <q>strengthened the heavens;</q>  <q>by which all things were made,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037837"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> <q>and without which nothing was made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037838"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Nor need we dwell any longer on this point, as if it were not the very Word Himself, who is spoken of under the name both of Wisdom and of Reason, and of the entire Divine Soul and Spirit. He became also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and was begotten when He proceeded forth from Him. Do you then, (you ask,) grant that the Word is a certain substance, constructed by the Spirit and the communication of Wisdom? Certainly I do. But you will not allow Him to be really a substantive being, by having a substance of His own; in such a way that He may be regarded as an objective thing and a person, and so be able (as being constituted second to God <em>the Father</em>,) to make two, the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, God and the Word. For you will say, what is a word, but a voice and sound of the mouth, and (as the grammarians teach) air when struck against,  intelligible to the ear, but for the rest a sort of void, empty, and incorporeal thing. I, on the contrary, contend that nothing empty and void could have come forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that it is not put forth from that which is empty and void; nor could that possibly be devoid of substance which has proceeded from so great a substance, and has produced such mighty substances: for all things which were made through Him, He Himself (personally) made. How could it be, that He Himself is nothing, without whom nothing was made? How could He who is empty have made things which are solid, and He who is void have made things which are full, and He who is incorporeal have made things which have body? For although a thing may sometimes be made different from him by whom it is made, yet nothing can be made by that which is a void and empty thing. Is that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, then, a void and empty thing, which is called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who Himself is designated God? <q>The Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037840"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> It is written, <q>You shall not take God's name in vain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037841"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;20:7</a></span> This for certain is He <q>who, being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037842"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> In what form of God?

Now, even if invisible things, whatsoever they be, have both their substance and their form in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby they are visible to God alone, how much more shall that which has been sent forth from His substance not be without substance! Whatever, therefore, was the substance of the Word that I designate a Person, I claim for it the name of <em>Son</em>; and while I recognize the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, I assert His distinction as second to the Father. </p>

<h2 class="chapter8">Chapter 8. Though the Son or Word of God Emanates from the Father, He is Not, Like the Emanations of Valentinus, Separable from the Father. Nor is the Holy Ghost Separable from Either. Illustrations from Nature</h2>

<p>If any man from this shall think that I am introducing some <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B2;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x1F75;</span> &mdash; that is to say, some prolation  of one thing out of another, as <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> does when he sets forth <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> from <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, one after another&mdash; then this is my first reply to you: Truth must not therefore refrain from the use of such a term, and its reality and meaning, because <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> also employs it. The fact is, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has rather taken it from Truth, in order to mould it into its own counterfeit.  Was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> put forth or not? Here take your stand with me, and flinch not. If He was put forth, then acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine has a prolation;  and never mind <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, when in any point it mimics the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The question now is, in what sense each side uses a given thing and the word which expresses it. <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> divides and separates his prolations from their Author, and places them at so great a distance from Him, that the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father: he longs, indeed, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, but cannot; nay, he is almost swallowed up and dissolved into the rest of matter.  With us, however, the Son alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note037849"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> and has Himself unfolded <q>the Father's bosom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037850"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> He has also heard and seen all things with the Father; and what He has been commanded by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that also does He speak. <span class="stiki" id="note037851"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;8:26</a></span> And it is not His own will, but the Father's, which He has accomplished, <span class="stiki" id="note037852"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;6:38</a></span> which He had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> most intimately, even from the beginning. <q>For what man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things which be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the Spirit which is in Him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037853"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> But the Word was formed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and (if I may so express myself) the Spirit is the body of the Word. The Word, therefore, is both always in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as He says, <q>I am in the Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037854"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;14:11</a></span> and is always with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to what is written, <q>And the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037855"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and never separate from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or other than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since <q>I and the Father are one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037856"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> This will be the prolation, taught by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  the guardian of the Unity, wherein we declare that the Son is a prolation from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, without being separated from Him. For God sent forth the Word, as the Paraclete also declares, just as the root puts forth the tree, and the fountain the river, and the sun the ray.  For these are <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B2;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;</span>, <em>or emanations</em>, of the substances from which they proceed. I should not hesitate, indeed, to call the tree the son or offspring of the root, and the river of the fountain, and the ray of the sun; because every original source is a parent, and everything which issues from the origin is an offspring. Much more is (this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of) the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who has actually received as His own peculiar designation the name of <em>Son</em>. But still the tree is not severed from the root, nor the river from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun; nor, indeed, is the Word separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Following, therefore, the form of these analogies, I confess that I call God and His Word&mdash; the Father and His Son&mdash; <em>two</em>. For the root and the tree are distinctly two things, but correlatively joined; the fountain and the river are also two forms, but indivisible; so likewise the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones. Everything which proceeds from something else must needs be second to that from which it proceeds, without being on that account separated. Where, however, there is a second, there must be two; and where there is a third, there must be three. Now the Spirit indeed is third from God and the Son; just as the fruit of the tree is third from the root, or as the stream out of the river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third from the sun. Nothing, however, is alien from that original source whence it derives its own properties. In like manner the Trinity, flowing down from the Father through intertwined and connected steps, does not at all disturb the <em>Monarchy</em>,  while it at the same time guards the state of the <em>Economy</em>. </p>

<h2 class="chapter9">Chapter 9. The Catholic Rule of Faith Expounded in Some of Its Points. Especially in the Unconfused Distinction of the Several Persons of the Blessed Trinity</h2>

<p>Bear always in mind that this is the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which I profess; by it I testify that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Spirit are inseparable from each other, and so will you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what sense this is said. Now, observe, my assertion is that the Father is one, and the Son one, and the Spirit one, and that They are distinct from Each Other. This statement is taken in a wrong sense by every uneducated as well as every perversely disposed person, as if it predicated a diversity, in such a sense as to imply a separation among the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Spirit. I am, moreover, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to say this, when (extolling the <em>Monarchy</em> at the expense of the <em>Economy</em>) they contend for the identity of the Father and Son and Spirit, that it is not by way of diversity that the Son differs from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but by distribution: it is not by division that He is different, but by distinction; because the Father is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since they differ one from the other in the mode of their being.  For the Father is the entire substance, but the Son is a derivation and portion of the whole,  as He Himself acknowledges: <q>My Father is greater than I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037863"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> In the Psalm His inferiority is described as being <q>a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q>  Thus the Father is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, being greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, inasmuch as He who begets is one, and He who is begotten is another; He, too, who sends is one, and He who is sent is another; and He, again, who makes is one, and He through whom the thing is made is another. Happily the Lord Himself employs this expression of the person of the Paraclete, so as to signify not a division or severance, but a disposition (of mutual relations in the Godhead); for He says, <q>I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and He shall send you another Comforter...even the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037865"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a></span> thus making the Paraclete distinct from Himself, even as we say that the Son is also distinct from the Father; so that He showed a third degree in the Paraclete, as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the second degree is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, by reason of the order observed in the <em>Economy</em>. Besides, does not the very fact that they have the distinct names of <em>Father</em> and <em>Son</em> amount to a declaration that they are distinct in personality?  For, of course, all things will be what their names represent them to be; and what they are and ever will be, that will they be called; and the distinction indicated by the names does not at all admit of any confusion, because there is none in the things which they designate. <q>Yes is yes, and no is no; for what is more than these, comes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037867"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;5:37</a></span> </p>

<h2 class="chapter10">Chapter 10. The Very Names of Father and Son Prove the Personal Distinction of the Two. They Cannot Possibly Be Identical, Nor is Their Identity Necessary to Preserve the Divine Monarchy</h2>

<p>So it is either the Father or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the day is not the same as the night; nor is the Father the same as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in such a way that Both of them should be One, and One or the Other should be Both&mdash;an opinion which the most conceited <q>Monarchians</q> maintain. He Himself, they say, made Himself a Son to Himself.  Now a Father makes a Son, and a Son makes a Father;  and they who thus become reciprocally related out of each other to each other cannot in any way by themselves simply become so related to themselves, that the Father can make Himself a Son to Himself, and the Son render Himself a Father to Himself. And the relations which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> establishes, them does He also guard. A father must needs have a son, in order to be a father; so likewise a son, to be a son, must have a father. It is, however, one thing to have, and another thing to be. For instance, in order to be a husband, I must have a wife; I can never myself be my own wife. In like manner, in order to be a father, I have a son, for I never can be a son to myself; and in order to be a son, I have a father, it being impossible for me ever to be my own father. And it is these relations which make me (what I am), when I come to possess them: I shall then be a father, when I have a son; and a son, when I have a father. Now, if I am to be to myself any one of these relations, I no longer have what I am myself to be: neither a father, because I am to be my own father; nor a son, because I shall be my own son. Moreover, inasmuch as I ought to <em>have</em> one of these relations in order to <em>be</em> the other; so, if I am to be both together, I shall fail to be one while I possess not the other. For if I must be myself my son, who am also a father, I now cease to have a son, since I am my own son. But by reason of not having a son, since I am my own son, how can I be a father? For I ought to <em>have</em> a son, in order to be a father. Therefore I am not a son, because I have not a father, who makes a son. In like manner, if I am myself my father, who am also a son, I no longer have a father, but am myself my father. By not having a father, however, since I am my own father, how can I be a son? For I ought to have a father, in order to be a son. I cannot therefore be a father, because I have not a son, who makes a father. Now all this must be the device of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash; this excluding and severing one from the other&mdash; since by including both together in one under pretence of the <em>Monarchy</em>, he causes neither to be held and acknowledged, so that He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since indeed He has not the Son; neither is He the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since in like manner He has not the Father: for while He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He will not be the Son. In this way they hold the <em>Monarchy</em>, but they hold neither the Father nor the Son. Well, but <q>with God nothing is impossible.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037870"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;19:26</a></span> <em>True enough</em>; who can be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it? Who also can be unaware that <q>the things which are impossible with men are possible with God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037871"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;18:27</a></span> <q>The foolish things also of the world has God chosen to confound the things which are wise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037872"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:27</a></span> We have read it all. Therefore, they argue, it was not difficult for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to make Himself both a Father and a Son, contrary to the condition of things among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For a barren <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to have a child against nature was no difficulty with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor was it for a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to conceive. Of course nothing is <q>too hard for the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037873"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;18:14</a></span> But if we choose to apply this principle so extravagantly and harshly in our capricious imaginations, we may then make out God to have done anything we please, on the ground that it was not impossible for Him to do it. We must not, however, because He is able to do all things suppose that He has actually done what He has not done. But we must inquire <em>whether He has really done it</em>. God could, if He had liked, have furnished man with wings to fly with, just as He gave wings to kites. We must not, however, run to the conclusion that He did this because He was able to do it. He might also have extinguished Praxeas and all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> at once; it does not follow, however, that He did, simply because He was able. For it was necessary that there should be both kites and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; it was necessary also that the Father should be crucified.  In one sense there will be something difficult even for God&mdash; namely, that which He has not done&mdash; not because He could not, but because He would not, do it. For with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be willing is to be able, and to be unwilling is to be unable; all that He has willed, however, He has both been able to accomplish, and has displayed His ability. Since, therefore, if God had wished to make Himself a Son to Himself, He had it in His power to do so; and since, if He had it in His power, He effected <em>His purpose</em>, you will then make good your <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His power and His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> (to do even this) when you shall have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to us that He actually did it.</p>

<h2 class="chapter11">Chapter 11. The Identity of the Father and the Son, as Praxeas Held It, Shown to Be Full of Perplexity and Absurdity. Many Scriptures Quoted in Proof of the Distinction of the Divine Persons of the Trinity</h2>

<p>It will be your duty, however, to adduce your <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> as plainly as we do, when we prove that He made His Word a Son to Himself. For if He calls Him Son, and if the Son is none other than He who has proceeded from <em>the Father</em> Himself, and if the Word has proceeded from <em>the Father</em> Himself, He will then be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and not Himself from whom He proceeded. For <em>the Father</em> Himself did not proceed from Himself. Now, you who say that the Father is the same as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, do really make the same Person both to have sent forth from Himself (and at the same time to have gone out from Himself as) that Being which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If it was possible for Him to have done this, He at all events did not do it. You must bring forth the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> which I require of you&mdash; one like my own; that is, (you must prove to me) that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> show the Son and the Father to be the same, just as on our side the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are demonstrated to be distinct; I say <em>distinct</em>, but not <em>separate</em>:  for as on my part I produce the words of God Himself, <q>My heart has emitted my most excellent Word,</q>  so you in like manner ought to adduce in opposition to me some text where God has said, <q>My heart has emitted Myself as my own most excellent Word,</q> in such a sense that He is Himself both the Emitter and the Emitted, both He who sent forth and He who was sent forth, since He is both the Word and God. I bid you also observe,  that on my side I advance the passage where the Father said to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <q>You are my Son, this day have I begotten You.</q>  If you want me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, show me some other passage where it is declared, <q>The Lord said unto Himself, I am my own Son, today have I begotten myself;</q> or again, <q>Before the morning did I beget myself;</q>  and likewise, <q>I the Lord possessed Myself the beginning of my ways for my own works; before all the hills, too, did I beget myself;</q>  and whatever other passages are to the same effect. Why, moreover, could God the Lord of all things, have hesitated to speak thus of Himself, if the fact had been so? Was He afraid of not being <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, if He had in so many words declared Himself to be both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>? Of one thing He was at any rate afraid&mdash; of lying. Of Himself, too, and of His own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, was He afraid. Believing Him, therefore, to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I am sure that He declared nothing to exist in any other way than according  to His own dispensation and arrangement, and that He had arranged nothing in any other way than according to His own declaration. On your side, however, you must make Him out to be a liar, and an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a>, and a tamperer with His word, if, when He was Himself a Son to Himself, He assigned the part of His Son to be played by another, when all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> attest the clear <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of, and distinction in (the Persons of) the Trinity, and indeed furnish us with our Rule <em>of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>, that He who speaks, and He of whom He speaks, and to whom He speaks, cannot possibly seem to be One and the Same. So absurd and misleading a statement would be unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, when it was Himself to whom He was speaking, He speaks rather to another, and not to His very self. Hear, then, other utterances also of the Father concerning the Son by the mouth of Isaiah: <q>Behold my Son, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom I am well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall bring forth judgment to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037881"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;42:1</a></span> Hear also what He says to the Son: <q>Is it a great thing for You, that You should be called my Son to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the dispersed of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? I have given You for a light to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that You may be their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the end of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037882"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;49:6</a></span> Hear now also the Son's utterances respecting the Father: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach the gospel unto men.</q>  He speaks of Himself likewise to the Father in the Psalm: <q>Forsake me not until I have declared the might of Your arm to all the generation that is to come.</q>  Also to the same purport in another Psalm: <q>O Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!</q>  But almost all the Psalms which prophesy of  the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, represent the Son as conversing with the Father&mdash; that is, <em>represent</em> Christ (as speaking) to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Observe also the Spirit speaking of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in the character of  a third Person: <q>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool.</q>  Likewise in the words of Isaiah: <q>Thus says the Lord to the Lord  mine Anointed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037890"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;45:1</a></span> Likewise, in the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, He says to the Father respecting the Son: <q>Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We brought a report concerning Him, as if He were a little child, as if He were a root in a dry ground, who had no form nor comeliness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037891"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1-2</a></span> These are a few testimonies out of many; for we do not pretend to bring up all the passages of Scripture, because we have a tolerably large accumulation of them in the various heads of our subject, as we in our several chapters call them in as our witnesses in the fullness of their dignity and authority.  Still, in these few quotations the distinction of <em>Persons in</em> the Trinity is clearly set forth. For there is the Spirit Himself who speaks, and the Father to whom He speaks, and the Son of whom He speaks.  In the same manner, the other passages also establish each one of several Persons in His special character&mdash; addressed as they in some cases are to the Father or to the Son respecting the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in other cases to the Son or to the Father concerning the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and again in other instances to the (Holy) Spirit.</p>

<h2 class="chapter12">Chapter 12. Other Quotations from Holy Scripture Adduced in Proof of the Plurality of Persons in the Godhead</h2>

<p>If the number of the Trinity also offends you, as if it were not connected in the simple Unity, I ask you how it is possible for a Being who is merely and absolutely One and Singular, to speak in plural phrase, saying, <q>Let us <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">make</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in our own image, and after our own likeness;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037894"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> whereas He ought to have said, <q>Let me make man in my own image, and after my own likeness,</q> as being a unique and singular Being? In the following passage, however, <q>Behold the man has become as one of us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037895"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;3:22</a></span> He is either deceiving or amusing us in speaking plurally, if He is One only and singular. Or was it to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that He spoke, as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> interpret the passage, because these also acknowledge not the Son? Or was it because He was at once the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that He spoke to Himself in plural terms, making Himself plural on that very account? Nay, it was because He had already His Son close at His side, as a second Person, His own Word, and a third Person also, the Spirit in the Word, that He purposely adopted the plural phrase, <q>Let <em>us</em> make;</q> and, <q>in <em>our</em> image;</q> and, <q>become as one <em>of us</em>.</q> For with whom did He make man? And to whom did He make him like? (The answer must be), the Son on the one hand, who was one day to put on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and the Spirit on the other, who was to sanctify man. With these did He then speak, in the Unity of the Trinity, as with His ministers and witnesses. In the following text also He distinguishes among the Persons: <q>So God created man in His own image; in the image of God created He him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037896"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27</a></span> Why say <q>image of God?</q> Why not <q>His own image</q> merely, if He was only one who was the Maker, and if there was not also One in whose image He made man? But there was One in whose image God was making man, that is to say, Christ's image, who, being one day about to become Man (more surely and more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> so), had already caused the man to be called His image, who was then going to be formed of clay&mdash; the image and similitude of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect Man. But in respect of the previous works of the world what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>? Its first statement indeed is made, when the Son has not yet appeared: <q>And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037897"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Immediately there appears the Word, <q>that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, which lights man on his coming into the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037898"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span> and through Him also came light upon the world.  From that moment God willed creation to be effected in the Word, Christ being present and ministering unto Him: and so God created. And God said, <q>Let there be a firmament,...and God made the firmament;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037900"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;1:6-7</a></span> and God also said, <q>Let there be lights (in the firmament); and <em>so</em> God made a greater and a lesser light.</q>  But all the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things did He in like manner make, who made the former ones&mdash; I mean the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, <q>through whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037902"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Now if He too is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to John, (who says,) <q>The Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037903"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> then you have two Beings&mdash; One that commands that the thing be made, and the Other that <em>executes the order and</em> creates. In what sense, however, you ought to understand Him to be another, I have already explained, on the ground of Personality, not of Substance&mdash; in the way of distinction, not of division.  But although I must everywhere hold one only substance in three coherent and inseparable (Persons), yet I am bound to acknowledge, from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the case, that He who issues a command is different from Him who executes it. For, indeed, He would not be issuing a command if He were all the while doing the work Himself, while ordering it to be done by the second.  But still He did issue the command, although He would not have intended to command Himself if He were only one; or else He must have worked without any command, because He would not have waited to command Himself.</p>

<h2 class="chapter13">Chapter 13. The Force of Sundry Passages of Scripture Illustrated in Relation to the Plurality of Persons and Unity of Substance. There is No Polytheism Here, Since the Unity is Insisted on as a Remedy Against Polytheism</h2>

<p>Well then, you reply, if He was God who spoke, and He was also God who created, at this rate, one God spoke and another created; (and thus) two Gods are declared. If you are so venturesome and harsh, reflect a while; and that you may think the better and more deliberately, listen to the psalm in which Two are described as God: <q>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Your kingdom <em>is a sceptre of righteousness</em>. You have loved righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity: therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You <em>or made You His Christ</em>.</q>  Now, since He here speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and affirms that God is anointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He must have affirmed that Two are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by reason of the sceptre's royal power. Accordingly, Isaiah also says to the Person of Christ: <q>The Sab&aelig;ans, men of stature, shall pass over to You; and they shall follow after You, bound in fetters; and they shall worship You, because God is in You: for You are our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not; You are the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  For here too, by saying, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in You,</q> and <q>You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he sets forth Two who were God: (in the former expression <em>in You</em>, he means) in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and (in the other he means) the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. That is a still grander statement which you will find expressly made in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037908"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> There was One <q>who was,</q> and there was another <q>with whom</q> He was. But I find in Scripture the name Lord also applied to them Both: <q>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on my right hand.</q>  And Isaiah says this: <q>Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037910"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1</a></span> Now he would most certainly have said <em>Your Arm</em>, if he had not wished us to understand that the Father is Lord, and the Son also is Lord. A much more ancient testimony we have also in Genesis: <q>Then the Lord rained upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037911"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;19:24</a></span> Now, either deny that this is Scripture; or else (let me ask) what sort of man you are, that you do not think words ought to be taken and understood in the sense in which they are written, especially when they are not expressed in allegories and <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, but in determinate and simple declarations? If, indeed, you follow those who did not at the time endure the Lord when showing Himself to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, because they would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be the Lord, then (I ask you) call to mind along with them the passage where it is written, <q>I have said, You are gods, and you are children of the Most High;</q>  and again, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stands in the congregation of gods;</q>  in order that, if the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has not been afraid to designate as gods <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, who have become sons of God by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you may be sure that the same Scripture has with greater propriety conferred the name of the Lord on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and one only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Very well! You say, I shall challenge you to preach from this day forth (and that, too, on the authority of these same Scriptures) two Gods and two Lords, consistently with your views. God forbid, (is my reply). For we, who by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God possess an insight into both the times and the occasions of the Sacred Writings, especially we who are followers of the Paraclete, not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <em>teachers</em>, do indeed definitively declare that <em>Two</em> Beings are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and, with the addition of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, even <em>Three</em>, according to the principle of the <em>divine</em> economy, which introduces <em>number</em>, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely infer, be Himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been born and to have suffered, which it is not lawful to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, forasmuch as it has not been so handed down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue that the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and each is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but because in earlier times Two were actually spoken of as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He might be both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him who is both God and Lord. Now, if there were found in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> but one Personality of Him who is God and Lord, Christ would <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> enough be inadmissible to the title of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Lord: for (in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>) there was declared to be none other than One God and One Lord, and it must have followed that the Father should Himself seem to have come down (to earth), inasmuch as only One God and One Lord was ever read of (in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>), and His entire <em>Economy</em> would be involved in obscurity, which has been planned and arranged with so clear a foresight <em>in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> dispensation</em> as matter for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. As soon, however, as Christ came, and was recognised by us as the very Being who had from the beginning  caused plurality  (in the Divine Economy), being the <em>second</em> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and with the Spirit the <em>third</em>, and Himself declaring and manifesting the Father more fully (than He had ever been before), the title of Him who is God and Lord was at once restored to the Unity (of the Divine Nature), even because the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> would have to pass from the multitude of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to the One Only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that a difference might be distinctly settled between the worshippers of One God and the votaries of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>. For it was only right that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should shine in the world as <q>children of light,</q> adoring and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as <q>the light of the world.</q> Besides, if, from that perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>  which assures us that the title of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Lord is suitable both to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, we were to invoke <em>a plurality of</em> gods and lords, we should quench our torches, and we should become less courageous to endure the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> sufferings, from which an easy escape would everywhere lie open to us, as soon as we swore by <em>a plurality of</em> gods and lords, as sundry <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do, who hold more gods than One. I will therefore not speak of gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle; so that if the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father <q> <em>God</em>,</q> and invoke <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as <q> <em>Lord</em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037917"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;1:7</a></span> But when Christ alone (is mentioned), I shall be able to call Him <q> <em>God</em>,</q> as the same apostle says: <q>Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037918"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> For I should give the name of <q> <em>sun</em></q> even to a sunbeam, considered in itself; but if I were mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at once withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam. For although I make not two suns, still I shall reckon both the sun and its ray to be as much two things and two forms  of one undivided substance, as God and His Word, as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter14">Chapter 14. The Natural Invisibility of the Father, and the Visibility of the Son Witnessed in Many Passages of the Old Testament. Arguments of Their Distinctness, Thus Supplied</h2>

<p>Moreover, there comes to our aid, when we insist upon the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> as being <em>Two</em>, that regulating principle which has determined God to be invisible. When <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> desired to see the face of the Lord, saying, <q>If therefore I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, manifest Yourself unto me, that I may see You and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037920"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;33:13</a></span> <em>God</em> said, <q>You can not see my face; for there shall no man see me, and live:</q>  in other words, he who sees me shall die. Now we find that God has been seen by many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and yet that no one who saw Him died (at the sight). <em>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is</em>, they saw God according to the faculties of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but not in accordance with the full <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Godhead. For the patriarchs are said to have seen God (as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Jacob), and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (as, for instance Isaiah and Ezekiel), and yet they did not die. Either, then, they ought to have died, since they had seen Him&mdash; for (the sentence runs), <q>No man shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and live;</q> or else if they saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet did not die, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is false in stating that God said, <q>If a man see my face, he shall not live.</q> Either way, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> misleads us, when it makes God invisible, and when it produces Him to our sight. Now, then, He must be a different Being who was seen, because of one who was seen it could not be predicated that He is invisible. It will therefore follow, that by Him who is invisible we must understand the Father in the fullness of His majesty, while we recognise the Son as visible by reason of the dispensation of His derived <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>;  even as it is not permitted us to contemplate the sun, in the full amount of his substance which is in the heavens, but we can only endure with our eyes a ray, by reason of the tempered condition of this portion which is projected from him to the earth. Here some one on the other side may be disposed to contend that the Son is also invisible as being the Word, <em>and</em> as being also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>;  and, while claiming one nature for the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, to affirm that the Father is rather One and the Same <em>Person</em> with the Son. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, as we have said, maintains their difference by the distinction it makes between the Visible and the Invisible. They then go on to argue to this effect, that if it was the Son who then spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, He must mean it of Himself that His face was visible to no one, because He was Himself indeed the invisible Father in the name of the Son. And by this means they will have it that the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same, just as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are the same; (and this they maintain) because in a preceding passage, before He had refused (the sight of) His face to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> informs us that <q>the Lord spoke face to face with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, even as a man speaks unto his friend;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037924"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;33:11</a></span> just as Jacob also says, <q>I have seen God face to face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037925"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;32:30</a></span> Therefore the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same; and both being thus the same, it follows that He is invisible as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and visible as the Son. As if the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, according to our exposition of it, were inapplicable to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when the Father is set aside in His own invisibility. We declare, however, that the Son also, considered in Himself (as the Son), is invisible, in that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; but that He was visible before <em>the days of</em> His flesh, in the way that He says to <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and Miriam, <q>And if there shall be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> among you, I will make myself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>; not as with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, with whom I shall speak mouth to mouth, even <em>apparently</em>, that is to say, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not <em>enigmatically</em>,</q> that is to say, in image; <span class="stiki" id="note037926"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse6">Numbers&nbsp;12:6-8</a></span> as the apostle also expresses it, <q>Now we see through a glass, darkly (or enigmatically), but then face to face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037927"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> Since, therefore, He reserves to some future time His presence and speech face to face with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>&mdash; a promise which was afterwards fulfilled in the retirement of the mount (of transfiguration), when as we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> appeared talking with Jesus</q> &mdash; it is evident that in early times it was always in a glass, (as it were,) and an enigma, in vision and dream, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I mean the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, appeared&mdash; to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the patriarchs, as also to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> indeed himself. And even if the Lord did possibly  speak with him face to face, yet it was not as man that he could behold His face, unless indeed it was in a glass, (as it were,) and by enigma. Besides, if the Lord so spoke with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> actually discerned His face, eye to eye,  how comes it to pass that immediately afterwards, on the same occasion, he desires to see His face,  which he ought not to have desired, because he had already seen it? And how, in like manner, does the Lord also say that His face cannot be seen, because He had shown it, if indeed He really had, (as our opponents suppose). Or what is that face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the sight of which is refused, if there was one which was visible to man? <q>I have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says Jacob, <q>face to face, and my life is preserved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037932"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;22:30</a></span> There ought to be some other face which kills if it be only seen. Well, then, was the Son visible? (Certainly not, ) although He was the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except only in vision and dream, and in a glass and enigma, because the Word and Spirit (of God) cannot be seen except in an imaginary form. But, (they say,) He calls the invisible Father His face. For who is the Father? Must He not be the face of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, by reason of that authority which He obtains as the begotten of the Father? For is there not a natural propriety in saying of some personage greater (than yourself), That man is my face; he gives me his countenance? <q>My Father,</q> says <em>Christ</em>, <q>is greater than I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037934"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> Therefore the Father must be the face of the Son. For what does the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> say? <q>The Spirit of His person is Christ the Lord.</q>  As therefore Christ is the Spirit of the Father's person, there is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> reason why, in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> indeed of the unity, the Spirit of Him to whose person He belonged&mdash; that is to say, the Father&mdash; pronounced Him to be His <q>face.</q> Now this, to be sure, is an astonishing thing, that the Father can be taken to be the face of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when He is His head; for <q>the head of Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037936"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> </p>

<h2 class="chapter15">Chapter 15. New Testament Passages Quoted. They Attest the Same Truth of the Son's Visibility Contrasted with the Father's Invisibility</h2>

<p>If I fail in resolving this article (of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>) by passages which may admit of dispute  out of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, I will take out of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> a confirmation of our view, that you may not straightway attribute to the Father every possible (relation and condition) which I ascribe to the Son. Behold, then, I find both in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and in the (writings of the) <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: <q>No man has seen God at any time;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037938"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> meaning, of course, at any previous time. But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says, <q>Whom no man has seen, nor can see;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037939"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> because the man indeed would die who should see Him.  But the very same <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> testify that they had both seen and <q>handled</q> Christ. <span class="stiki" id="note037941"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Now, if Christ is Himself both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh, but was invisible before <em>His appearance in</em> the flesh; so that He who as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? <em>How, I repeat, can all this be</em>, unless it be that <em>He</em> is one, who anciently was visible only in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, even the Word who was also made flesh; while <em>He</em> is another whom no man has seen at any time, <em>being</em> none else than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> saw. <q>That,</q> says John, <q>which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037942"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who, before <em>He came in</em> the flesh, was the <q>Word in the beginning with God</q> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note037943"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1-2</a></span> and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet was He with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He is God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and being joined to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is with the Father.  <q>And we have seen His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as of the only begotten of the Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037945"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> that is, of course, (the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, even Him who was visible, and was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself <em>and</em> in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, <em>ex abundanti</em> as it were: <q>No man has seen God at any time.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037946"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:12</a></span> What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: <q> <em>Him</em> we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.</q> Well, (I must again ask,) what God does he mean? It is of course the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has Himself declared Him. <span class="stiki" id="note037947"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> He was both heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> behold; but yet he saw not the Father. <q>Have I not,</q> he says, <q>seen Jesus <em>Christ our Lord</em>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037948"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:1</a></span> Moreover, he expressly called Christ <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: <q>Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037949"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> He shows us also that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ. Of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, however, he says to Timothy: <q>Whom none among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> has seen, nor indeed can see;</q> and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: <q>Who only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and dwells in the light which no man can approach unto.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037950"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: <q>Now unto the King <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, invisible, to the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037951"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:17</a></span> so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself&mdash; mortality, accessibility&mdash; of whom <em>the apostle</em> testifies that <q>He died according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037952"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:3</a></span> and that <q>He was seen by himself last of all,</q> &mdash; by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he experienced that light. <span class="stiki" id="note037954"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;22:11</a></span> <em>A like danger to which also befell</em> Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,  had only seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, they must have died then and there: <q>For no man shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037956"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;33:20</a></span> This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary,) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two&mdash; the Visible and the Invisible. It was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because <q>the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037957"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> &mdash; <q>do</q> that is, in His mind and thought.

<h2 class="chapter16">Chapter 16. Early Manifestations of the Son of God, as Recorded in the Old Testament; Rehearsals of His Subsequent Incarnation</h2>

<p>But you must not suppose that only the works which relate to the (creation of the) world were made by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but also whatsoever since that time has been done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <q>the Father who loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and has given all things into His hand,</q>  loves Him indeed from the beginning, and from the very first has handed all things over to Him. Whence it is written, <q>From the beginning the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037962"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> to whom <q>is given by the Father all power in heaven and on earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037963"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;28:18</a></span> <q>The Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037964"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;5:22</a></span> &mdash; from the very beginning even. For when He speaks of all power and all judgment, and says that all things were made by Him, and all things have been delivered into His hand, He allows no exception (in respect) of time, because they would not be <em>all things</em> unless they were <em>the things of all time</em>. It is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, therefore, who has been from the beginning administering judgment, throwing down the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the whole world by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of waters, raining upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> fire and brimstone, as the Lord from the Lord . For He it was who at all times came down to hold converse with men, from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> on to the patriarchs and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in vision, in dream, in mirror, in dark saying; ever from the beginning laying the foundation of the course <em>of His dispensations</em>, which He meant to follow out to the very last. Thus was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon earth, being no other than the Word which was to be made flesh. But He was thus learning (or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that we might the more readily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had come down into the world, if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that in times past also something similar had been done.

<p>They more readily supposed that the Father acted in the Son's name, than that the Son acted in the Father's; although the Lord says Himself, <q>I have come in my Father's name;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037979"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;5:43</a></span> and even to the Father He declares, <q>I have manifested Your name unto these men;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037980"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;17:6</a></span> while the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> likewise says, <q>Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord,</q>  that is to say, the Son in the Father's name. And as for the Father's names, God Almighty, the Most High, the Lord of hosts, the King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the <q>One that is,</q> we say (for so much do the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> teach us) that they belonged suitably to the Son also, and that the Son came under these designations, and has always acted in them, and has thus manifested them in Himself to men. <q>All things,</q> says He, <q>which the Father has are mine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037982"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;16:15</a></span> Then why not His names also?

As to the point maintained by them, that the name of Christ belongs also to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, they shall hear (what I have to say) in the proper place. Meanwhile, let this be my immediate answer to the argument which they adduce from the Revelation of John: <q>I am the Lord which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037984"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse8">Revelation&nbsp;1:8</a></span> and from all other passages which in their opinion make the designation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> unsuitable to the Son. As if, indeed, <em>He which is to come</em> were not almighty; whereas even the Son of the Almighty is as much almighty as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter18">Chapter 18. The Designation of the One God in the Prophetic Scriptures. Intended as a Protest Against Heathen Idolatry, It Does Not Preclude the Correlative Idea of the Son of God. The Son is in the Father</h2>

<p>But what hinders them from readily perceiving this community of the Father's titles in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is the statement of Scripture, whenever it determines God to be but One; as if the selfsame Scripture had not also set forth Two both as God and Lord, as we have shown above.  Their argument is: Since we find Two and One, therefore Both are One and the Same, both Father and Son. Now the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is not in danger of requiring the aid of any one's argument, lest it should seem to be self-contradictory. It has a method of its own, both when it sets forth one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and also when it shows that there are Two, Father and Son; and is consistent with itself. It is clear that the Son is mentioned by it. For, without any detriment to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it is quite possible for it to have rightly determined that God is only One, to whom the Son belongs; since He who has a Son ceases not on that account to exist,&mdash; Himself being One only, that is, on His own account, whenever He is named without the Son. And He is named without the Son whenever He is defined as the principle (of Deity) in the character of <q>its first Person,</q> which had to be mentioned before the name of the Son; because it is the Father who is acknowledged in the first place, and after the Father the Son is named. Therefore <q>there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>,</q> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>and without Him there is none else.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037986"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;45:5</a></span> And when He Himself makes this declaration, He denies not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but says that there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Son is not different from the Father. Indeed, if you only look carefully at the contexts which follow such statements as this, you will find that they nearly always have distinct reference to the makers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and the worshippers thereof, with a view to the multitude of false gods being expelled by the unity of the Godhead, which nevertheless has a Son; and inasmuch as this Son is undivided and inseparable from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so is He to be reckoned as being in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even when He is not named. The fact is, if He had named Him expressly, He would have separated Him, saying in so many words: <q>Beside me there is none else, <em>except my Son</em>.</q> In short He would have made His Son actually another, after excepting Him from others. Suppose the sun to say, <q>I am the Sun, and there is none other besides me, except my ray,</q> would you not have remarked how useless was such a statement, as if the ray were not itself reckoned in the sun? He says, then, that there is no God besides Himself in respect of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> both of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> as well as of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; nay, even on account of our <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also, who fabricate <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> with their words, just as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> do with their hands; that is to say, they make another God and another Christ. When, therefore, He attested His own unity, the Father took care of the Son's interests, that Christ should not be supposed  to have come from another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but from Him who had already said, <q>I am God and there is none other beside me,</q>  who shows us that He is the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in company with His Son, with whom <q>He stretches out the heavens alone.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037988"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;44:24</a></span> </p>

<h2 class="chapter19">Chapter 19. The Son in Union with the Father in the Creation of All Things. This Union of the Two in Co-Operation is Not Opposed to the True Unity of God. It is Opposed Only to Praxeas' Identification Theory</h2>

<p>But this very declaration of His they will hastily pervert into an argument of His <em>singleness</em>. <q>I have,</q> says He, <q>stretched out the heaven alone.</q> Undoubtedly <em>alone</em> as regards all other powers; and He thus gives a premonitory evidence against the conjectures of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who maintain that the world was constructed by various <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and powers, who also make the Creator Himself to have been either an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or some subordinate agent sent to form external things, such as the constituent parts of the world, but who was at the same time <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <em>of the divine purpose</em>. If, now, it is in this sense that He stretches out the heavens alone, how is it that these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> assume their position so perversely, as to render inadmissible the singleness of that Wisdom which says, <q>When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037989"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;8:27</a></span> &mdash; even though the apostle asks, <q>Who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counsellor?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037990"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse34">Romans&nbsp;11:34</a></span> meaning, of course, to except that wisdom which was present with Him. <span class="stiki" id="note037991"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse30">Proverbs&nbsp;8:30</a></span> In Him, at any rate, and with Him, did (Wisdom) construct the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, He not being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what she was making. <q>Except Wisdom,</q> however, is a phrase of the same sense exactly as <q>except the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> who is Christ, <q>the Wisdom and Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037992"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> according to the apostle, who only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the mind of the Father. <q>For who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things that be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except the Spirit which is in Him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037993"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> Not, observe, <em>without</em> Him. There was therefore One who caused God to be not alone, except <q>alone</q> from all other <em>gods</em>. But (if we are to follow the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>), the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> itself will have to be rejected, because it tells us that all things were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the Word, without whom nothing was made. <span class="stiki" id="note037994"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> And if I am not mistaken, there is also another passage in which it is written: <q>By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hosts of them by His Spirit.</q>  Now this Word, the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must be the very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. So that, if (He did) all things by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He must have stretched out the heavens by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and so not have stretched them out alone, except in the sense in which He is <q>alone</q> (and apart) from all other gods. Accordingly He says, concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, immediately afterwards: <q>Who else is it that frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> mad, turning wise men backward, and making their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> foolish, and confirming the words <span class="stiki" id="note037996"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse25">Isaiah&nbsp;44:25</a></span> of His Son?</q> &mdash; as, for instance, when He said, <q>This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased; hear Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037998"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> By thus attaching the Son to Himself, He becomes His own interpreter in what sense He stretched out the heavens alone, meaning <em>alone with His Son</em>, even as He is one with His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. The utterance, therefore, will be in like manner the Son's, <q>I have stretched out the heavens alone,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037999"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;44:24</a></span> because <em>by the Word</em> were the heavens established.  Inasmuch, then, as the heaven was prepared when Wisdom was present in the Word, and since all things were made by the Word, it is quite correct to say that even the Son stretched out the heaven alone, because He alone ministered to the Father's work. It must also be He who says, <q>I am the First, and to all futurity I AM.</q>  The Word, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, was before all things. <q>In the beginning was the Word;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038002"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and in that beginning He was sent forth  by the Father. The Father, however, has no beginning, as proceeding from none; nor can He be seen, since He was not begotten. He who has always been alone could never have had order or rank. Therefore, if they have determined that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> must be regarded as one and the same, for the express purpose of vindicating the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that unity of His is preserved intact; for He is one, and yet He has a Son, who is equally with Himself comprehended in the same Scriptures. Since they are unwilling to allow that the Son is <em>a distinct Person</em>, second from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, lest, being thus second, He should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> two Gods to be spoken of, we have shown above  that Two are actually described in Scripture as God and Lord. And to prevent  their being offended at this fact, we give a reason why they are not said to be two Gods and two Lords, but that they are two as Father and Son; and this not by severance of their substance, but from the dispensation wherein we declare the Son to be undivided and inseparable from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>&mdash;distinct in degree, not in state. And although, when named apart, He is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He does not thereby constitute two Gods, but one; and that from the very circumstance that He is entitled to be called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from His union with the Father.</p>

<h2 class="chapter20">Chapter 20. The Scriptures Relied on by Praxeas to Support His Heresy But Few. They are Mentioned by Tertullian</h2>

<p>But I must take some further pains to rebut their arguments, when they make selections from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in support of their opinion, and refuse to consider the other points, which obviously maintain the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without any infraction of the unity of the Godhead, and with the full admission  of the Monarchy. For as in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Scriptures they lay hold of nothing else than, <q>I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and beside me there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038006"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;45:5</a></span> so in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> they simply keep in view the Lord's answer to Philip, <q>I and my Father are one;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038007"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> and, <q>He that has seen me has seen the Father; and I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038008"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9-10</a></span> They would have the entire revelation of both Testaments yield to these three passages, whereas the only proper course is to understand the few statements in the light of the many. But in their contention they only act on the principle of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For, inasmuch as only a few testimonies are to be found (making for them) in the general mass, they pertinaciously set off the few against the many, and assume the later against the earlier. The rule, however, which has been from the beginning established for every case, gives its prescription against the later <em>assumptions</em>, as indeed it also does against the fewer.</p>

<h2 class="chapter21">Chapter 21. In This and the Four Following Chapters It is Shown, by a Minute Analysis of St. John's Gospel, that the Father and Son are Constantly Spoken of as Distinct Persons</h2>

<p>Consider, therefore, how many passages present their prescriptive authority to you in this very <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> before this inquiry of Philip, and previous to any discussion on your part. And first of all there comes at once to hand the preamble of John to his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which shows us what He previously was who had to become flesh. <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038009"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1-3</a></span> Now, since these words may not be taken otherwise than as they are written, there is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> shown to be One who was from the beginning, and also One with whom He always was: one the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, the other God (although the Word is also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <em>God</em> regarded as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not as the Father); One through whom were all things, Another by whom were all things. But in what sense we call Him <em>Another</em> we have already often described. In that we called Him Another, we must needs imply that He is not identical&mdash; not identical indeed, yet not as if separate; <em>Other</em> by dispensation, not by division. He, therefore, <em>who</em> became flesh was not the very same as He from whom the Word came. <q>His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was beheld&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as of the only-begotten of the Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038010"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> not, (observe,) as of the Father. He <q>declared</q> (what was in) <q>the bosom of the Father alone;</q>  the Father did not <em>divulge the secrets of</em> His own bosom. For this is preceded by another statement: <q>No man has seen God at any time.</q>  Then, again, when He is designated by John (the Baptist) as <q>the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038013"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> He is not <em>described as Himself the same with Him</em> of whom He is the beloved <em>Son</em>. He is, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, ever the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but yet not He Himself of whom He is the Son. This (divine relationship) Nathan&aelig;l at once recognised in Him, <span class="stiki" id="note038014"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse49">John&nbsp;1:49</a></span> even as Peter did on another occasion: <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038015"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> And He affirmed Himself that they were quite right in their convictions; for He answered Nathan&aelig;l: <q>Because I said, I saw you under the fig-tree, therefore do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038016"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse50">John&nbsp;1:50</a></span> And in the same manner He pronounced Peter to be <q>blessed,</q> inasmuch as <q>flesh and blood had not revealed it to him</q>&mdash; that he had perceived the Father&mdash; <q>but the Father which is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038017"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;16:17</a></span> By asserting all this, He determined the distinction which is between the two Persons: that is, the Son then on earth, whom Peter had confessed to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and the Father in heaven, who had revealed to Peter the discovery which he had made, that Christ was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.

He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in the Son has everlasting life; and he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not the Son shall not see life, but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides on him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038021"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;3:35-36</a></span> Whom, indeed, did He reveal to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>?

And it was on this very account that <q>the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> sought the more intently to kill Him, not only because He broke the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, but also because He said that God was His Father, thus making Himself equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then indeed did He answer and say unto them, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for what things soever He does these also does the Son likewise. For the Father loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will also show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel. For as <em>the Father</em> raises up the dead and quickens them, even so the Son also quickens whom He will. For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father. He that honours not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, honours not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who has sent the Son. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my words, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. Verily I say unto you, that the hour is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and when they have heard it, they shall live. For as the Father has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life in Himself, so also has He given to the Son to have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life in Himself; and He has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note038026"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19-27</a></span> &mdash; that is, according to the flesh, even as He is also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> through His Spirit.  Afterwards He goes on to say: <q>But I have greater <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish&mdash; those very works bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me that the Father has sent me.

<h2 class="chapter22">Chapter 22. Sundry Passages of St. John Quoted, to Show the Distinction Between the Father and the Son. Even Praxeas' Classic Text&mdash; I and My Father are One&mdash; Shown to Be Against Him</h2>

<p>Again, whose doctrine does He announce, at which all were astonished?  Was it His own or the Father's? So, when they were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> among themselves whether He were the Christ (not as being the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of course but as the Son), He says to them <q>You are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, because I am from Him.</q>  He did not say, Because I myself am He; and, I have sent my own self: but His words are, <q>He has sent me.</q> When, likewise, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> sent men to apprehend Him, He says: <q>Yet a little while am I with you, and (then) I go unto Him that sent me.</q>  When, however, He declares that He is not alone, and uses these words, <q>but I and the Father that sent me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038043"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;8:16</a></span> does He not show that there are Two&mdash; Two, and yet inseparable? Indeed, this was the sum and substance of what He was teaching them, that they were inseparably Two; since, after citing the law when it affirms the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of two men's testimony,  He adds at once: <q>I am one who am bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of myself; and the Father (is another,) who has sent me, and bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me.</q>  Now, if He were one&mdash; being at once both the Son and the Father&mdash; He certainly would not have quoted the sanction of the law, which requires not the testimony of one, but of two. Likewise, when they asked Him where His Father was,  He answered them, that they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> neither Himself nor the Father; and in this answer He plainly told them of <em>Two</em>, whom they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of. Granted that <q>if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, they would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father also,</q>  this certainly does not imply that He was Himself both Father and Son; but that, by reason of the inseparability of the Two, it was impossible for one of them to be either acknowledged or unknown without the other. <q>He that sent me,</q> says He, <q>is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and I am telling the world those things which I have heard of Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038048"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;8:26</a></span> And the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> narrative goes on to explain in an exoteric manner, that <q>they understood not that He spoke to them concerning the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>  although they ought certainly to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the Father's words were <em>uttered</em> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because they read in Jeremiah, <q>And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038050"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:9</a></span> and again in Isaiah, <q>The Lord has given to me the tongue of learning that I should understand when to speak a word in season.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038051"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;50:4</a></span> In accordance with which, <em>Christ</em> Himself says: <q>Then shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am He and that I am saying nothing of my own self; but that, as my Father has taught me, so I speak, because He that sent me is with me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038052"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;8:28-29</a></span> This also amounts to a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they were Two, (although) undivided. Likewise, when upbraiding the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in His discussion with them, because they wished to kill Him, He said, <q>I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and you do that which you have seen with your father;</q>  <q>but now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which I have heard of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and again, <q>If God were your Father, you would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me, for I proceeded forth and came from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  (still they are not hereby separated, although He declares that He proceeded forth <em>from the Father</em>. Some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> indeed seize the opportunity afforded them in these words <em>to propound their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of His separation</em>; but His coming out from God is like the ray's procession from the sun, and the river's from the fountain, and the tree's from the seed); <q>I have not a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> my Father;</q>  again, <q>If I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> myself, my <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is nothing: it is my Father that honours me, of whom you say, that He is your God: yet you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him; and if I should say, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not, I shall be a liar like you; but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, and keep His saying.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038057"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse54">John&nbsp;8:54-55</a></span> But when He goes on to say, <q> <em>Your father</em> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad,</q>  He certainly proves that it was not the Father that appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, but the Son. In like manner He declares, in the case of the man <em>born</em> blind, <q>that He must do the works of the Father <em>which had sent Him</em>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038059"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;9:4</a></span> and after He had given the man sight, He said to him, <q>Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</q> Then, upon the man's inquiring who <em>He</em> was, He proceeded to reveal Himself to him, as that Son <em>of God</em> whom He had announced to him as the right object of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  In a later passage He declares that He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father by Him; <span class="stiki" id="note038061"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;10:15</a></span> adding that He was so wholly loved by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He was laying down His life, because He had received this commandment from the Father.  When He was asked by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> if He were the very Christ  (meaning, of course, the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for to this day the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> expect not the Father Himself, but the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it being nowhere said that the Father will come as the Christ), He said to them, <q>I am telling you, and yet you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: the works which I am doing, in my Father's name, they actually bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me.</q>  Witness of what? Of that very thing, to be sure, of which they were making inquiry&mdash; whether He were the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then, again, concerning His sheep, and (the assurance) that no man should pluck them out of His hand,  He says, <q>My Father, which gave them to me, is greater than all;</q>  adding immediately, <q>I am and my Father are one.</q>  Here, then, they take their stand, too infatuated, nay, too blind, to see in the first place that there is in this passage an intimation of Two Beings&mdash; <q> <em>I and my Father</em>;</q> then that there is a plural predicate, <q> <em>are</em>,</q> inapplicable to one person only; and lastly, that (the predicate terminates in an abstract, not a personal noun)&mdash; <q>we are one <em>thing</em></q> <em>Unum</em>, not <q>one person</q> <em>Unus</em>. For if He had said <q>one Person,</q> He might have rendered some assistance to their opinion. <em>Unus</em>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, indicates the singular number; but (here we have a case where) <q>Two</q> are still the subject in the masculine gender. He accordingly says <em>Unum</em>, a neuter term, which does not imply singularity of number, but unity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, likeness, conjunction, affection on the Father's part, who loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and submission on the Son's, who obeys the Father's will. When He says, <q>I and my Father are one</q> <em>in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a></em>&mdash; <em>Unum</em>&mdash; He shows that there are Two, whom He puts on an equality and unites in one. He therefore adds to this very statement, that He <q>had showed them many works from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> for none of which did He deserve to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note038068"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;10:32</a></span> And to prevent their thinking Him deserving of this <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, as if He had claimed to be considered as God Himself, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by having said, <q>I and my Father are One,</q> representing Himself as the Father's divine Son, and not as God Himself, He says, <q>If it is written in your law, I said, You are gods; and if the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> cannot be broken, say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, that He blasphemes, because He said, I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? If I do not the works of my Father, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me not; but if I do, even if you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, still <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in me.</q>  It must therefore be by the works that the Father is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son in the Father; and so it is by the works that we understand that the Father is one <em>with the Son</em>. All along did He therefore strenuously aim at this conclusion, that while they were of one power and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, they should still be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be Two; for otherwise, unless they were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be Two, the Son could not possibly be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at all.</p>

If either the Father spoke from heaven to the Son when He Himself was the Son on earth, or the Son <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Father when He was Himself the Son in heaven, how happens it that the Son made a request of His own very self, by asking it of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since the Son was the Father? Or, on the other hand, how is it that the Father made a promise to Himself, by making it to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since the Father was the Son? Were we even to maintain that they are two separate gods, as you are so fond of throwing out against us, it would be a more tolerable assertion than the maintenance of so versatile and changeful a God as yours! Therefore it was that in the passage before us the Lord declared to the people present: <q>Not on my own account has this voice addressed me, but for your sakes,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038083"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;12:30</a></span> that these likewise may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> both in the Father and in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, severally, in their own names and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and positions. <q>Then again, Jesus exclaims, and says, He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not on me, but on Him that sent me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038084"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;12:44</a></span> because it is through the Son that men <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, while the Father also is the authority whence springs belief in the Son. <q>And he that sees me, sees Him that sent me.</q>  How so? Even because, (as He afterwards declares,) <q>I have not spoken from myself, but the Father which sent me: He has given me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038086"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse49">John&nbsp;12:49</a></span> For <q>the Lord God has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when I ought to speak</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038087"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;50:4</a></span> the word which I actually speak. <q>Even as the Father has said unto me, so do I speak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038088"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse50">John&nbsp;12:50</a></span> Now, in what way these things were said to Him, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> and beloved <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> John <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> better than Praxeas; and therefore he adds concerning his own meaning: <q>Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was going to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Praxeas, however, would have it that it was the Father who proceeded forth from Himself, and had returned to Himself; so that what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> put into the heart of Judas was the betrayal, not of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but of the Father Himself. But for the matter of that, things have not turned out well either for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; because, even in the Son's case, the treason which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> wrought against Him contributed nothing to his advantage. It was, then, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who was in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, that was betrayed, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says afterwards: <q>Now is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him.</q>  Who is here meant by <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</q> Certainly not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the Word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who was in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>&mdash; that is in the flesh, in which Jesus had been already <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by <em>the divine</em> power and word. <q>And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says He, <q>shall also glorify Him in Himself;</q>  that is to say, the Father shall glorify the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He has Him within Himself; and even though prostrated to the earth, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, He would soon glorify Him by His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, and making Him conqueror over death.</p>

<p>But there were some who even then did not understand. For <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Thomas</a>, who was so long incredulous, said: <q>Lord, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whither You go; and how can we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the way?

If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, you would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father also: but henceforth you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, and have seen Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038092"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;14:5-7</a></span> And now we come to Philip, who, roused with the expectation of seeing the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not understanding in what sense he was to take <q>seeing the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> says: <q>Show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and it suffices us.</q>  Then the Lord answered him: <q>Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, Philip?</q>  Now whom does He say that they ought to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>?&mdash; for this is the sole point of discussion. Was it as the Father that they ought to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, or as the Son? If it was as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Praxeas must tell us how Christ, who had been so long time with them, could have possibly ever been (I will not say understood, but even) supposed to have been the Father. He is clearly defined to us in all Scriptures&mdash; in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. In this character was He anciently predicted, in this was He also declared even by Christ Himself; nay, by the very Father also, who openly confesses Him from heaven as His Son, and as His Son glorifies Him. <q>This is my beloved Son;</q> <q>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him, and I will glorify Him.</q> In this character, too, was He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and rejected by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. It was, moreover, in this character that He wished to be accepted by them whenever He named the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and gave preference to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and honoured the Father. This, then, being the case, it was not the Father whom, after His lengthened intercourse with them, they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, but it was the Son; and accordingly the Lord, while upbraiding <em>Philip</em> for not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Himself who was the object of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, wished Himself to be acknowledged indeed as that <em>Being</em> whom He had reproached them for being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of after so long a time&mdash; in a word, as the Son.

And then He also set the conjunction of the two Persons in the clearest light, in order that no wish might be entertained of seeing the Father as if He were separately visible, and that the Son might be regarded as the representative of the Father. And yet He omitted not to explain how the Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. <q>The words,</q> says He, <q>which I speak unto you, are not mine,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038107"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span> because indeed they were the Father's words; <q>but the Father that dwells in me, He does the works.</q>  It is therefore by His mighty works, and by the words of His doctrine, that the Father who dwells in the Son makes Himself visible&mdash; even by those <em>words and works</em> whereby He abides in Him, and also by Him in whom He abides; the special properties of Both the Persons being apparent from this very circumstance, that He says, <q>I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father is in me.</q>  Accordingly He adds: <q>Believe&mdash; </q> What?

<h2 class="chapter25">Chapter 25. The Paraclete, or Holy Ghost. He is Distinct from the Father and the Son as to Their Personal Existence. One and Inseparable from Them as to Their Divine Nature. Other Quotations Out of St. John's Gospel</h2>

<p>What follows Philip's question, and <em>the Lord's</em> whole treatment of it, to the end of <em>John's</em> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, continues to furnish us with statements of the same kind, distinguishing the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, with the properties of each. Then there is the Paraclete <em>or Comforter</em>, also, which He promises to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to send from heaven after He had ascended to the Father. <em>He is called</em> <q>another Comforter,</q> indeed; <span class="stiki" id="note038111"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a></span> but in what way He is <em>another</em> we have already shown,  <q>He shall receive of mine,</q> says Christ, <span class="stiki" id="note038113"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;16:14</a></span> just as <em>Christ</em> Himself received of the Father's. Thus the connection of the Father in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the Son in the Paraclete, produces three coherent Persons, <em>who are yet distinct</em> One from Another. These Three are one  <em><a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a></em>, not one <em>Person</em>,  as it is said, <q>I and my Father are One,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038116"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> in respect of unity of substance not singularity of number.

<h2 class="chapter26">Chapter 26. A Brief Reference to the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. Their Agreement with St. John, in Respect to the Distinct Personality of the Father and the Son</h2>

<p>In addition to Philip's conversation, and the Lord's reply to it, the reader will observe that we have run through John's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <em>to show</em> that many other passages of a clear purport, both before and after that chapter, are only in strict accord with that single and prominent statement, which must be interpreted agreeably to all other places, rather than in opposition to them, and indeed to its own inherent and natural sense. I will not here largely use the support of the other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, which confirm our belief by the Lord's <em>nativity</em>: it is sufficient to remark that He who had to be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is announced in express terms by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> himself as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you; therefore also the Holy Thing that shall be born of you shall be called <em>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038125"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> On this passage even they will wish to raise a cavil; but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will prevail. Of course, they say, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the power of the highest is the Most High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate  what, if it had been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, would have been written. Whom was he  so afraid of as not plainly to declare, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come upon you, and the Highest shall overshadow you?</q> Now, by saying <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a></q> (although the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> <em>is God</em>,) and by not directly naming <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he wished that portion  of the whole <em>Godhead</em> to be understood, which was about to retire into the designation of <q>the Son.</q> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> in this passage must be the same <em>as the</em> Word. For just as, when John says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038129"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> we understand the Spirit also in the mention of the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise in the name of the Spirit. For both the Spirit is the substance of the Word, and the Word is the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the Two are One (and the same).  Now John must mean <em>One</em> when he speaks of Him as <q>having been made flesh,</q> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <em>Another</em> when he announces Him as <q>about to be born,</q> if the Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is not actually He whose <em>Word</em> He is, so also the Spirit (although He is called God) is not actually He whose <em>Spirit</em> He is said to be. Nothing which belongs to something else is actually the very same thing as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a personal subject,  and so belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be such in quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it proceeds, and to whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because proceeding from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but yet is not actually the very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that which is God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although He is an actually existing thing,  yet He cannot be God Himself  (exclusively), but so far God as He is of the same substance as God Himself, and as being an actually existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will <q>the power of the Highest</q> not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an actually existing thing, as being Spirit&mdash; in the same way as the <em>wisdom</em> (of God) and the <em><a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a></em> (of God) is not God: these <em>attributes</em> are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance. Power is incidental to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but cannot itself be the Spirit.

<h2 class="chapter27">Chapter 27. The Distinction of the Father and the Son, Thus Established, He Now Proves the Distinction of the Two Natures, Which Were, Without Confusion, United in the Person of the Son. The Subterfuges of Praxeas Thus Exposed</h2>

<p>But why should I linger over matters which are so evident, when I ought to be attacking points on which they seek to obscure the plainest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>? For, confuted on all sides on the distinction between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which we maintain without destroying their inseparable union&mdash; as (by the examples) of the sun and the ray, and the fountain and the river&mdash; yet, by help of (their conceit) an indivisible number, (with issues) of two and three, they endeavour to interpret this <em>distinction</em> in a way which shall nevertheless tally with their own opinions: so that, all in one Person, they distinguish two, Father and Son, understanding the Son to be flesh, that is man, that is Jesus; and the Father to be spirit, that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Thus they, while contending that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are one and the same, do in fact begin by dividing them rather than uniting them. For if Jesus is one, and Christ is another, then the Son will be different from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because the Son is Jesus, and the Father is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Such a <em>monarchy</em> as this they learned, I suppose, in the school of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, making two&mdash; Jesus and Christ. But this conception of theirs has been, in fact, already confuted in what we have previously advanced, because the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is also called the power of the Highest, whom they make the Father; whereas these relations  are not themselves the same as He whose relations they are said to be, but they proceed from Him and appertain to Him. However, another refutation awaits them on this point of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. See, say they, it was announced by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: <q>Therefore that Holy Thing which shall be born of you shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038151"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> Therefore, (they argue,) as it was the flesh that was born, it must be the flesh that is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Nay, (I answer,) this is spoken concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. For it was certainly of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> that the virgin conceived; and that which He conceived, she brought forth. That, therefore, had to be born which was conceived and was to be brought forth; that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, whose <q>name should be called <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> which, being interpreted, is, God with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038152"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;1:23</a></span> Besides, the flesh is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that it could not have been said concerning it, <q>That Holy Thing shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> but only that Divine Being who was born in the flesh, of whom the psalm also says, <q>Since God became man in the midst of it, and established it by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father.</q>  Now what Divine Person was born in it? The Word, and the Spirit which became incarnate with the Word by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father. The Word, therefore, is incarnate; and this must be the point of our inquiry: How the Word became flesh&mdash;whether it was by having been transfigured, as it were, in the flesh, or by having really clothed Himself in flesh. Certainly it was by a real clothing of Himself in flesh. For the rest, we must needs <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God to be unchangeable, and incapable of form, as being <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But transfiguration is the destruction of that which previously <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. For whatsoever is transfigured into some other thing ceases to be that which it had been, and begins to be that which it previously was not. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, neither ceases to be what He was, nor can He be any other thing than what He is. The Word is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <q>the Word of the Lord remains for ever,</q>&mdash; even by holding on unchangeably in His own proper form. Now, if He admits not of being transfigured, it must follow that He be understood in this sense to have become flesh, when He comes to be in the flesh, and is manifested, and is seen, and is handled by means of the flesh; since all the other points likewise require to be thus understood. For if the Word became flesh by a transfiguration and change of substance, it follows at once that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> must be a substance compounded of  two substances&mdash; of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>&mdash;a kind of mixture, like <em>electrum</em>, composed of gold and silver; and it begins to be neither gold (that is to say, spirit) nor silver (that is to say, flesh)&mdash;the one being changed by the other, and a third substance produced. Jesus, therefore, cannot at this rate be God for He has ceased to be the Word, which was made flesh; nor can He be Man incarnate for He is not properly flesh, and it was flesh which the Word became. Being compounded, therefore, of both, He actually is neither; He is rather some third substance, very different from either. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, we find that He is expressly set forth as both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>; the very psalm which we have quoted intimating (of the flesh), that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> became Man in the midst of it, He therefore established it by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>&mdash; certainly in all respects as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>, differing no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> according to each substance in its own special property, inasmuch as the Word is nothing else but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the flesh nothing else but Man. Thus does the apostle also teach respecting His two substances, saying, <q>who was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038155"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;1:3</a></span> in which words He will be Man and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. <q>Who was declared to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>;</q>  in which words He will be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. We see plainly the twofold state, which is not confounded, but conjoined in One Person&mdash; Jesus, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>. Concerning Christ, indeed, I defer what I have to say.  (I remark here), that the property of each nature is so wholly preserved, that the Spirit  on the one hand did all things in Jesus suitable to Itself, such as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and wonders; and the Flesh, on the other hand, exhibited the affections which belong to it. It was hungry under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, thirsty with the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, wept over Lazarus, was troubled even unto death, and at last actually died. If, however, it was only a <em>tertium quid</em>, some composite <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> formed out of the Two substances, like the <em>electrum</em> (which we have mentioned), there would be no distinct <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> apparent of either nature. But by a transfer of functions, the Spirit would have done things to be done by the Flesh, and the Flesh such as are effected by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; or else such things as are suited neither to the Flesh nor to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but confusedly of some third character. Nay more, on this supposition, either the Word underwent death, or the flesh did not die, if so be the Word was converted into flesh; because either the flesh was <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, or the Word was mortal. Forasmuch, however, as the two substances acted distinctly, each in its own character, there necessarily accrued to them severally their own operations, and their own issues. Learn then, together with <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, that <q>that which is born in the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038159"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;3:6</a></span> Neither the flesh becomes Spirit, nor the Spirit flesh. In one <em>Person</em> they no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> are well able to be co-existent. Of them Jesus consists&mdash; Man, of the flesh; of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, God&mdash; and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> designated Him as <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038160"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> in respect of that nature, in which He was Spirit, reserving for the flesh the appellation <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>.</q> In like manner, again, the apostle calls Him <q>the Mediator between God and Men,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038161"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> and so affirmed His participation of both substances. Now, to end the matter, will you, who interpret the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be flesh, be so good as to show us what the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is? Will He then, I want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, be the Spirit? But you insist upon it that the Father Himself is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, on the ground that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit,</q> just as if we did not read also that there is <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>;</q> in the same manner as we find that as <q>the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> so also there is <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.</q></p>

<h2 class="chapter28">Chapter 28. Christ Not the Father, as Praxeas Said. The Inconsistency of This Opinion, No Less Than Its Absurdity, Exposed. The True Doctrine of Jesus Christ According to St. Paul, Who Agrees with Other Sacred Writers</h2>

<p>And so, most foolish <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, you make <em>Christ</em> to be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, without once considering the actual force of this name, if indeed Christ is a name, and not rather a surname, or designation; for it signifies <q>Anointed.</q> But Anointed is no more a proper name than Clothed or Shod; it is only an accessory to a name. Suppose now that by some means Jesus were also called Vestitus (<em>Clothed</em>), as He is actually called Christ from the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His anointing, would you in like manner say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and at the same time suppose that <em>Vestitus</em> was the Father? Now then, concerning Christ, if Christ is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Father is an Anointed One, and receives the unction of course from another. Else if it is from Himself that He receives  it, then you must prove it to us. But we learn no such fact from the Acts of the Apostles in that ejaculation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Lord, against Your Holy Child Jesus, whom You have anointed, both <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <em>and the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em> were gathered together.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038162"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse27">Acts&nbsp;4:27</a></span> These then testified both that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that being the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He was anointed by the Father. Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who anointed the Son. To the same effect are the words of Peter: <q>Let all the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> assuredly that God has made that same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> that is, <em>Anointed</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note038163"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse36">Acts&nbsp;2:36</a></span> John, moreover, brands that man as <q>a liar</q> who <q>denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ;</q> while on the other hand he declares that <q>every one is born of God who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ.</q>  Wherefore he also exhorts us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the name of His (<em>the Father's</em>,) Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, that <q>our fellowship may be with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and with His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038165"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in like manner, everywhere speaks of <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> When writing to the Romans, he gives thanks to God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note038166"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;1:8</a></span> To the Galatians he declares himself to be <q>an apostle not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither by man, but through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038167"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> You possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same effect, and set forth Two&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Son of the Father. (They also testify) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Himself the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and under one or the other designation the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person, even the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, does either name alone without the other belong to the same Person. Consequently, whether it be the name Jesus which occurs alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus is the Anointed One; or if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names <em><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>, the former is the proper one, which was given to Him by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; and the latter is only an adjunct, predicable of Him from His anointing,&mdash; thus suggesting the proviso that Christ must be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that by the name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the Father this name of Christ! For if Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He says, <q>I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038168"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> He of course shows plainly enough that there is above Himself another Father and another God. If, again, the Father is Christ, <em>He</em> must be some other Being who <q>strengthens the thunder, and creates the wind, and declares unto men His Christ.</q>  And if <q>the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against <em>the Lord and against</em> His Christ,</q>  that Lord must be another Being, against whose Christ were gathered together the kings and the rulers. And if, to quote another passage, <q>Thus says the Lord to my Lord Christ,</q>  the Lord who speaks to the Father of Christ must be a distinct Being. Moreover, when the apostle in his epistle <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, <q>That the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038172"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;1:17</a></span> He must be other (than Christ), who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the bestower of spiritual gifts.

Now, although when two substances are alleged to be in Christ&mdash; namely, the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>&mdash; it plainly follows that the divine nature is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and that which is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> is mortal, it is manifest in what sense he declares <q>Christ died</q>&mdash; even in the sense in which He was flesh and Man and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, not as being the Spirit and the Word and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. In short, since he says that it was <em>Christ</em> (that is, the Anointed One) that died, he shows us that that which died was the nature which was anointed; in a word, the flesh. Very well, say you; since we on our side affirm our doctrine in precisely the same terms which you use on your side respecting the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we are not guilty of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, for we do not maintain that He died after the divine nature, but only after the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Nay, but you do <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>; because you allege not only that the Father died, but that He died the death of the cross. For <q>cursed are they which are hanged on a tree,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038176"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> &mdash; a curse which, after the law, is compatible to the Son (inasmuch as <q>Christ has been made a curse for us,</q>  but certainly not the Father); since, however, you convert Christ into the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, you are chargeable with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Father. But when we assert that Christ was crucified, we do not malign Him with a curse; we only re-affirm  the curse pronounced by the law: <span class="stiki" id="note038179"><a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy&nbsp;21:23</a></span> nor indeed did the apostle utter <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> when he said the same thing as we. <span class="stiki" id="note038180"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> Besides, as there is no <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> in predicating of the subject that which is fairly applicable to it; so, on the other hand, it is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> when that is alleged concerning the subject which is unsuitable to it. On this principle, too, the Father was not associated in suffering with the Son. <em>The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a></em>, indeed, fearing to incur direct <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, hope to diminish it by this expedient: they grant us so far that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are Two; adding that, since it is the Son indeed who suffers, the Father is only His fellow-sufferer.  But how absurd are they even in this conceit! For what is the meaning of <q>fellow-suffering,</q> but the endurance of suffering along with another? Now if the Father is incapable of suffering, He. is incapable of suffering in company with another; otherwise, if He can suffer with another, He is of course capable of suffering. You, in fact, yield Him nothing by this subterfuge of your fears. You are afraid to say that He is capable of suffering whom you make to be capable of fellow-suffering. Then, again, the Father is as incapable of fellow-suffering as the Son even is of suffering under the conditions of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Well, but how could the Son suffer, if the Father did not suffer with Him? <em>My answer is</em>, The Father is separate from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, though not from <em>Him as</em> God. For even if a river be soiled with mire and mud, although it flows from the fountain identical in nature with it, and is not separated from the fountain, yet the injury which affects the stream reaches not to the fountain; and although it is the water of the fountain which suffers down the stream, still, since it is not affected at the fountain, but only in the river, the fountain suffers nothing, but only the river which issues from the fountain. So likewise the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>,  whatever suffering it might be capable of in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, yet, inasmuch as it could not suffer in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>the fountain of the Godhead</em>, but only in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it evidently could not have suffered,  as the Father. But it is enough for me that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> suffered nothing as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>,  since all that It suffered It suffered in the Son. It was quite another matter for the Father to suffer with <em>the Son in the flesh</em>. This likewise has been treated by us. Nor will any one deny this, since even we are ourselves unable to suffer for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> be in us, who also utters by our instrumentality  whatever pertains to our own conduct and suffering; not, however, that He Himself suffers in our suffering, only He bestows on us the power and capacity of suffering.</p>

<p>However, if you persist in pushing your views further, I shall find means of answering you with greater stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself, so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and reasoning about <em>that</em>? You have Him exclaiming in the midst of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>: <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038186"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;27:46</a></span> Either, then, the Son suffered, being <q>forsaken</q> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father consequently suffered nothing, inasmuch as He forsook the Son; or else, if it was the Father who suffered, then to what God was it that He addressed His cry? But this was the voice of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is to say, of man&mdash; not of the Word and Spirit, that is to say, not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it was uttered so as to prove the impassibility of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <q>forsook</q> His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, so far as He handed over His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> substance to the suffering of death. This verity the apostle also perceived, when he writes to this effect: <q>If the Father spared not His own Son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038187"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> This did Isaiah before him likewise perceive, when he declared: <q>And the Lord has delivered Him up for our offenses.</q>  In this manner He <q>forsook</q> Him, in <em>not sparing</em> Him; <q>forsook</q> Him, in <em>delivering Him up</em>. In all other respects the Father did not forsake the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for it was into His Father's hands that the Son commended His spirit. <span class="stiki" id="note038189"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span> Indeed, after so commending it, He instantly died; and as the Spirit  remained with the flesh, the flesh cannot undergo the full extent of death, <em>i.e., in corruption and decay</em>. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, therefore, to die, amounted to His being forsaken by the Father. The Son, then, both dies and rises again, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note038191"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:3-4</a></span> It is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, too, who ascends to the heights of heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note038192"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span> and also descends to the inner parts of the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note038193"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> <q>He sits at the Father's right hand</q> &mdash; not the Father at His own. He is seen by Stephen, at his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a>, still sitting at the right hand of God <span class="stiki" id="note038195"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse55">Acts&nbsp;7:55</a></span> where He will continue to sit, until the Father shall make His enemies His footstool.  He will come again on the clouds of heaven, just as He appeared when He ascended into heaven.  Meanwhile He has received from the Father the promised gift, and has shed it forth, even the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>&mdash; the Third Name in the Godhead, and the Third Degree of the Divine Majesty; the Declarer of the One <em>Monarchy of God</em>, but at the same time the Interpreter of the <em>Economy</em>, to every one who hears and receives the words of the new <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>;  and <q>the Leader into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038199"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;16:13</a></span> such as is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter31">Chapter 31. Retrograde Character of the Heresy of Praxeas. The Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity Constitutes the Great Difference Between Judaism and Christianity</h2>

<p>But, (this doctrine of yours bears a likeness) to the Jewish <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of which this is the substance&mdash; so to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in One God as to refuse to reckon the Son besides Him, and after the Son the Spirit. Now, what difference would there be between us and them, if there were not this distinction <em>which you are for breaking down</em>? What need would there be of the gospel, which is the substance of the New Covenant, laying down (as it does) that the Law and the Prophets lasted until John <em>the Baptist</em>, if thenceforward the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Spirit are not both <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in as Three, and as making One Only God? God was pleased to renew His covenant with man in such a way as that His Unity might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in, after a new manner, through the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in order that God might now be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> openly,  in His proper Names and Persons, who in ancient times was not plainly understood, though declared through the Son and the Spirit. Away, then, with  those <q>Antichrists who deny the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q> For they deny the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when they say that He is the same as the Son; and they deny the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when they suppose Him to be the same as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by assigning to Them things which are not <em>Theirs</em>, and taking away from Them things which are <em>Theirs</em>.
